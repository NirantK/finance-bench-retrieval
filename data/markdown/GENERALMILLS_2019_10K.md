PART I

ITEM 1    Business

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean General Mills,
Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded and
unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.
(Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018, we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in
13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint
ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all
geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential
growth platforms, which are Häagen-Dazs
ice cream, snack bars, Old
El
Paso
Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3)
reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures. We believe executing against this growth framework should result in long-
term value creation for our shareholders.

As part of our portfolio shaping strategy, in fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We financed the
transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our
Pet operating segment on a one-month lag. In fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings did not include Pet operating segment results. For
further information on the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice;
Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.

We offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our business is focused on
the following large, global categories:

•

•

•

•

•

  snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;

  ready-to-eat cereal;

  convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;

  yogurt;

  pet food;

Table of Contents

•

•

•

  super-premium ice cream;

  baking mixes and ingredients; and

  refrigerated and frozen dough.

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside North
America, and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contributed by
each class of similar products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Customers. Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains,
e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. We
generally sell to these customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types
of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2019, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of
net sales of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information
on significant customers, please refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Competition. The packaged foods categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the
world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers
with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal
competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product
quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights,
effective customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an
efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional
brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local
manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits,
vegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal
packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the
United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost
of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations,
currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed price
contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs.
Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective
is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs
generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price
movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides

4

Table of Contents

us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories
that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, and
exploratory research in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $222 million in fiscal 2019 and $219 million in
fiscal 2018.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have
become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.

Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing products (e.g.,
Reese’s
Puffs
for cereal, Green
Giant
for vegetables in certain countries, and Cinnabon
for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) and
shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equities).

Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé
trademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its trademarks to CPW,
including the Nestlé
and Uncle
Toby’s
trademarks. The Häagen-Dazs
trademark is licensed royalty-free and exclusively to Nestlé for ice cream and other
frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada. The Häagen-Dazs
trademark is also licensed to HDJ. The Pillsbury
brand and the Pillsbury
Doughboy
character are subject to an exclusive, royalty-free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix
categories in the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico.

The Yoplait
trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest. These marks are
licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a 51 percent interest. Yoplait SAS licenses these trademarks to its franchisees. The Liberté
trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest.

We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations.
We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are
materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerated
dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso
soup is higher during the fall and winter
months. Internationally, within

5

Table of Contents

our Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand for Häagen-Dazs
ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for
baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the
northern and southern hemispheres, our international segments’ net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

BACKLOG

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as of
May 26, 2019, was not material.

WORKING CAPITAL

A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices are described in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

EMPLOYEES

As of May 26, 2019, we had approximately 40,000 full- and part-time employees.

QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of consumer and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various
federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of
Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of
the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As of May 26, 2019, we were involved with two active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes
located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws
and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with
environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

ITEM 1A    Risk Factors

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well
as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce.
All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other
widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices.
Competition in our product categories is based on

8

Table of Contents

product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery
to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or
promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues
and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in
introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build
and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label
products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.

There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers
may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name
products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing
expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume
growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019, Walmart
accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. PetSmart and Petco accounted for
36 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our Pet segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic.
If national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating results
may be adversely affected. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report.

Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.

The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity,
limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies
and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase
productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against
changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross
margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally
soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in
both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated
corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses
are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of
these accounting treatments.

If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive
markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more

difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could
adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing
facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume
and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable
to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution
capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/export
restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location.
Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single
supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients.

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients.
Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and
delivery disruptions.

If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if
consumers or their pets are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant
losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also
suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse
publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the
value of our brands.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to
their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by
a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging
e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in
turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects
of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than
populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in
faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories.
If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may
purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a
reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or
competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume
away from home at customers that purchase products from our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.

Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in
large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of
factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the
quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products
becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional
support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and
opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and
reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.

Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.

In fiscal 2019, 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating
to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

  political and economic instability;
  exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
  tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;
  nationalization of operations;
  compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
  uncertainty relating to the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union;
  foreign tax treaties and policies; and
  restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.

11

Table of Contents

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material
variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese
renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our
exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and
Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the
production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to
comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of
our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign
laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the
audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of
doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and
regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation
obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of
ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in
relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay
dividends.

As of May 26, 2019, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $15.4 billion. The agreements under which we have issued
indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:

•

•

  ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our

debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and

  flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these
requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain
additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in
turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.

12

Table of Contents

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our
suppliers and customers.

We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows,
financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future,
there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.
We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an
increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from
tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.

From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable
element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be
available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and
security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension,
retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a
globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,
investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic
benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative
impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.

Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and
systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with
regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes
including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These
technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and
storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of
which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as
catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers,
employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information
technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology
systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or
proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational,
reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our
reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

As of May 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the
reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting
unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales
and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions,
market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we
continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance
of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.

We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue
Buffalo
, Pillsbury
, Totino’s
, Progresso
, Yoplait
,
Old
El
Paso
, Yoki
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Annie’s
brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires
significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of
the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in
distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected
revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our Pillsbury
, Yoki
,
and Progresso
brands have experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill
and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which is
a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. We had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and our lack of
experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage Blue Buffalo successfully following the acquisition.

The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to
meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of,
or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, the integration of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customers
and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include:

•
•

  diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;
  difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the acquisition;

14

Table of Contents

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;
  difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures, and accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures;
  difficulties in the assimilation of employees;
  challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;
  difficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities;
  challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;
  the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and
  coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and
diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us
becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be
realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the
anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause
reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Blue
Buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.

Blue Buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations.

The business, prospects, and financial performance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth
rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Blue Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. Our failure to do so could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. When we acquired Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2018, we recorded significant
brand intangible and goodwill assets at fair value based on, among other things, our projections of Blue Buffalo’s financial performance. Our failure to meet
or exceed our projections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including a material impairment to our
intangible assets.

Our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.

From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our
ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional
potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the
assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior
experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

ITEM 7    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work
continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity
of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building
strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in organic net sales,
adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and cash return to shareholders are key drivers of financial performance for our
business.

Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver:

•
•
•
•
•

  low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;
  mid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;
  high single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS;
  free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and
  cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.

We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all
geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential
growth platforms, which are Häagen-Dazs
ice cream, snack bars, Old
El
Paso
Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3)
reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. By focusing on this growth
framework, we expect to generate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should result in
long-term value creation for our shareholders.

In fiscal 2019 we executed well and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets, including organic net sales growth and constant-currency
growth in net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS. Relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in U.S. Yogurt and
our emerging market businesses, we increased our contributions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the U.S., and we generated greater
benefits from net price realization and mix through our Strategic Revenue Management capability. These results were partially offset by challenging
performance for U.S. snack bars, leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets.

We successfully transitioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales
and segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings,
increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted
diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow
conversion.

Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit
of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency
basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased
4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).

Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings
attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash
flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling
interests. We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion.

A detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2019 Consolidated Results of
Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance compared to our fiscal 2017 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal
2018 Results of Consolidated Operations.”

In fiscal 2020, our plans include continued strong innovation and investments in capabilities and brand building to accelerate our topline growth, efficiency
initiatives to maintain our strong margins, and a disciplined focus on cash to further reduce our leverage. We remain confident that executing our Consumer
First strategy and our Compete, Accelerate, and Reshape growth framework will drive sustainable, profitable growth and attractive long-term returns for our
shareholders.

Our key full-year fiscal 2020 targets are summarized below:

•
•

•
•

  Organic net sales are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent.
  Constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2 to 4 percent from the base of $2.8 billion reported in fiscal 2019. Benefit of the 53
rd week in fiscal 2020 will be reinvested in capabilities and brand-building initiatives to drive improvement in our organic net sales growth rate in 2020
and beyond.

  Constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to increase 3 to 5 percent from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019.
  Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings.

FISCAL 2019 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag
and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.

In fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal
year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges
recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating
profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail
segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven
by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent
on a constant-currency basis (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

The 7 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, favorable net price realization and mix across all other segments, and
higher contributions from volume growth in the Asia & Latin America segment, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth in the North
America Retail, Europe & Australia, and Convenience Stores & Foodservice segments.

Organic net sales in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to fiscal 2018, as favorable organic net price realization and mix was offset by declining contributions
from organic volume growth.

Cost of sales increased $804 million in fiscal 2019 to $11,108 million. The increase was driven by a $503 million increase due to higher volume and a
$194 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53 million
charge related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We recorded a $36 million net increase in cost of sales
related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of $32 million in fiscal 2018 (please
see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2019, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges in cost of

sales compared to $14 million in fiscal 2018. We also recorded $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019
compared to $11 million in fiscal 2018 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

Gross margin increased 6 percent in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34.1 percent decreased 40 basis points
compared to fiscal 2018.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $86 million to $2,936 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in
SG&A expenses primarily reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by a decrease in media and advertising expense. SG&A expenses as a
percent of net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2018.

Divestitures loss  totaled $30 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and
recorded a pre-tax loss of $35 million. We also sold our yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the
purchaser for their use of the Yoplait
brand. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $5 million.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $275 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $166 million in fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2019, as a result of lower sales projections in our long range plans for the businesses supporting our Progresso

brand intangible assets, we recorded $193 million of impairment charges related to these brand intangible assets (please see Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

In addition, in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $15 million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our North America Retail and
Asia & Latin America segments.

Charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2019 consisted of the following:

In fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In connection with these actions we
recorded $80 million of restructuring charges, consisting of $23 million of severance expense and $57 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. Four
of our operating segments were affected by these actions including $54 million related to our North America Retail segment, $13 million related to our
Asia & Latin America segment, $12 million related to our Europe & Australia segment, and $1 million related to our Pet segment. We expect these actions
to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022.

We spent $49 million of cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.

Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Benefit plan  non-service  income  totaled $88 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $89 million in fiscal 2018 (please see to Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

Interest, net for fiscal 2019 totaled $522 million, $148 million higher than fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher debt levels due to financing for the Blue
Buffalo acquisition.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 17.7 percent compared to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2018. The 15.0 percentage point increase reflects the lower
statutory rate in fiscal 2019 being more than offset by the impact of the one-time, provisional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to
the TCJA. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8 percent in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section
below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due
to the net benefits associated with the TCJA, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by jurisdiction.

The TCJA includes provisions affecting our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic
operations to 21 percent; a provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (GILTI); a limitation on deductible
interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. In fiscal 2019,
we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the
measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million to $72 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11 million
after-tax share of restructuring charges at CPW, and lower net sales and higher input costs for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from
joint ventures decreased 14 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of
measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Average diluted shares outstanding increased by 20 million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 due to the impact of the fiscal 2018 share issuance to partially

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

Our businesses are organized into five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin
America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet

PET SEGMENT
Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, e-commerce retailers, grocery
stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet
foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address
specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and
textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not

Pet net sales and segment operating profit in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,431 million and $268 million, respectively. Pet operating profit includes a $53 million
purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired and $13 million of amortization of the customer list intangible asset.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS

Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the
General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other
items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain
commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

In fiscal 2019, unallocated corporate expense increased $134 million to $340 million compared to $206 million last year, primarily driven by compensation
and benefits expenses. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $36 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions
and grain inventories compared to a $32 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges, and
$1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019, compared to $14 million of restructuring charges and $11 million of
restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $16 million gain from a legal recovery related to our
Yoplait SAS subsidiary and $23 million of gains related to certain investment valuation adjustments. We also recorded $26 million of integration costs in
fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo compared to $34 million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded a
$3 million loss related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2019 and 4 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation
of approximately 4 percent in fiscal 2020. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk
management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

LIQUIDITY

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated $5.6 billion in cash.
A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from
operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally
issue shares of stock, to finance significant acquisitions.

As of May 26, 2019, we had $399 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, the historic undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were taxed in the U.S. via the one-time repatriation tax in fiscal 2018. We have re-evaluated our assertion and have
concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion
beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from
which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings. As a result of the
transition tax, we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax
liability (please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

During fiscal 2019, cash provided by operations was $2,807 million compared to $2,841 million in the same period last year. The $34 million decrease was
primarily driven by a $377 million decrease in net earnings and a $550 million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $598 million
change in deferred income taxes. The $550 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413 million change in the timing of
accounts payable, including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years. The change in deferred income taxes was primarily
related to the $638 million provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the
TCJA in fiscal 2018.

We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2019, core working capital decreased 34 percent, compared
to a net sales increase of 7 percent. As of May 26, 2019, our core working capital balance totaled $385 million, down 34 percent versus last year, this is
primarily driven by continued benefits from our payment terms extension program and lower inventory balances. In fiscal 2018, core working capital
decreased 27 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 1 percent.

In fiscal 2019, we used $556 million of cash through investing activities compared to $8.7 billion in fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the
acquisition of Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion, including $103 million of consideration for net debt repaid, in fiscal 2018. We
invested $538 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2019, $85 million less than fiscal 2018.

We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5 percent of reported net sales in fiscal 2020. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are
expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

Financing activities used $2.2 billion of cash in fiscal 2019 compared to providing $5.4 billion in fiscal 2018. We had $1.2 billion of net debt repayments in
fiscal 2019 compared to $6.3 billion of net debt issuances in fiscal 2018, which partially funded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. For more information on
our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

During fiscal 2019, we received $241 million of net proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $99 million in fiscal 2018.
During fiscal 2018, we received $970 million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition.

Share repurchases in fiscal 2019 were insignificant. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $602 million.

Dividends paid in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,182 million, or $1.96 per share, consistent with fiscal 2018.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of
short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed
credit lines that support our foreign operations.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2019, we were
in compliance with all of these covenants.

We have $1,396 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 2.2 percent notes due
October 2019, €300.0 euro-denominated 0.0 percent notes due January 2020, and €500.0 million euro-denominated floating-rate notes due January 2020.
We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital
needs for at least the next 12 months.

Table of Contents

As of May 26, 2019, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 74 percent in fixed-rate and 26 percent in
floating-rate instruments, compared to 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 27, 2018.

Our net debt to operating cash flow ratio declined to 5.0 in fiscal 2019 from 5.4 in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in long-term debt. Our net
debt-to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio declined to 3.9 in fiscal 2019 from 4.2 on a pro forma basis
in fiscal 2018, consistent with our plans to reduce our leverage following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for
our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal International
(Sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record
Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a
redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times
before December 2024. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $552 million which approximates its fair value.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $56 million in Yoplait SAS.

The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income
based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation
(currently $252 million). On June 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus
142.5 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a
remarketing auction.

We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and
the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be
charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As of May 26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $682 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and
guarantees and comfort letters of $134 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet
arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $483 million as of May 26, 2019.

As of May 26, 2019, we invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019.

Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to
make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020.

(b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer
marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all
significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are
cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and
accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $17.3 million as of May 26,

2019, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those
instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain
of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay approximately
$20 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately $18 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2020. We are unable to
reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2020. As of May 26, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and
penalties was $165.1 million.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our
significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These
estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based
compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon
redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using
significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and
actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade liabilities were $484 million as of May 26, 2019,
and $500 million as of May 27, 2018. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in
subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

33

Table of Contents

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted
cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a
discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of
discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on
useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such
as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and
expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.
Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-
range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

As of May 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible
exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding
future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense.
We performed our fiscal 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of lower sales
projections in our long-range plans for the businesses supporting the Progresso

While having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date, the Pillsbury
brand intangible asset and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of
decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

Redeemable Interest
In fiscal 2019, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant
assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending,
depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was
$552 million.

Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material
impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend
yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

Assumptions:

Risk-free interest rate

  8.5 years
17.8 %
2.9 %

The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of
grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 9 percent. If all other
assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal
2019 option awards by 8 percent.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.
Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to
prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.

35

Table of Contents

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall
tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend,
in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the
underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.

Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results
could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Income Taxes
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected
ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. We also
sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also
provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
postemployment benefit plans.

We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make various
assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant
management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations
include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future
long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We
review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly
influence our evaluation.

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets
were 6.6 percent, 6.6 percent, 10.3 percent, 8.4 percent, and 7.9 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 26, 2019.

On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.25 percent for fiscal 2019, 7.88 percent for fiscal 2018, and
8.17 percent for fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2020, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.0 percent due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $70 million for
fiscal 2020. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce

36

Table of Contents

year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and
the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense
or income.

Discount Rates
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the
yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of
May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to
determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a
forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash
outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:

Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit
plan expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $55 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method
over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is
viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates
We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information
provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used
by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and
short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65
at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are
applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,
to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health
care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience
gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average
remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.

Financial Statement Impact
In fiscal 2019, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $24 million compared to
$23 million of expense in fiscal 2018 and $56 million of expense in fiscal 2017. As of May 26, 2019, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses
of $2.0 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $81 million on our postretirement and
postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan
assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently
exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.

Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment
performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these
plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedge
accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard also
simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not expect this guidance to have
a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in certain leases
being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent
amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is
the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition
approach, which requires application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented, or the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires
application of the guidance at the adoption date.

We are in the process of implementing lease accounting software, developing a centralized business process, and implementing corresponding controls. We
have substantially completed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020
using the cumulative effect adjustment approach and electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including not reassessing
whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical

38

Table of Contents

classification of those leases. In addition, we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. We do not expect the effects to the Consolidated Financial Statements to be pervasive. We estimate that we will record right of use assets and
related liabilities of approximately $400 to $500 million, subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our lease portfolio and discount
rates. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for noncancelable future lease commitments.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful
information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.

For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most
directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional
material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition
to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.

Several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in
management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates

We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors
and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that organic net
sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the
effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week, when applicable, have on
year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our
Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.

Net Sales Growth Rate on a Constant-currency Basis

We believe this measure of net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance by excluding
the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.

Net sales growth rate on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:

Percentage change in net sales as reported
Impact of foreign currency exchange

Adjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate

This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for
incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to
evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures

Our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude,
or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring
charges and project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth
also excludes the effect of a 53rd week, acquisitions, and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to
their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable
degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and
restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2020. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2020 GAAP financial results.

For fiscal 2020, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions,
divestitures, and a 53rd week to increase net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial
impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth; and restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously
announced to total approximately $49 million.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR”
PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
that are based on our current expectations and assumptions. We also may make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained
in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to shareholders.

The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” or similar expressions identify
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those currently anticipated or projected. We wish to caution you
not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.

In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that could
affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from any current opinions or statements.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, such as: competitive dynamics in the consumer foods industry and the markets for our products,
including new product introductions, advertising activities, pricing actions, and promotional activities of our competitors; economic conditions, including
changes in inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, or the availability of capital; product development and innovation; consumer acceptance of new products
and product improvements; consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion levels; acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets,
including our acquisition of Blue Buffalo and issues in the integration of Blue Buffalo and retention of key management and employees; unfavorable
reaction to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo by customers, competitors, suppliers, and employees; changes in capital structure; changes in the legal and
regulatory environment, including tax legislation, labeling and advertising regulations, and litigation; impairments in the carrying value of goodwill, other
intangible assets, or other long-lived assets, or changes in the useful lives of other intangible assets; changes in accounting standards and the impact of
significant accounting estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product liability; changes in consumer demand for our products;
effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; changes in consumer behavior, trends, and preferences, including weight loss trends;
consumer

perception of health-related issues, including obesity; consolidation in the retail environment; changes in purchasing and inventory levels of significant
customers; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply chain resources, including raw materials, packaging, and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies
in the supply chain; effectiveness of restructuring and cost saving initiatives; volatility in the market value of derivatives used to manage price risk for
certain commodities; benefit plan expenses due to changes in plan asset values and discount rates used to determine plan liabilities; failure or breach of our
information technology systems; foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and economic
uncertainty due to terrorism or war.

You should also consider the risk factors that we identify in Item 1A of this report, which could also affect our future results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to
reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factors
could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by
entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these
transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a
variety of derivative financial instruments. For information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

VALUE AT RISK

The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was
used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential
volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics ™ data set. The calculations are not intended to
represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying
exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of
the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity
swaps, futures, and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related
positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity,

ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States, using management’s best estimates and judgments where
appropriate. The financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and transactions are
recorded accurately in all material respects, in accordance with management’s authorization. We maintain a strong audit program that independently
evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities, and
there are documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly communicated policies
demand highly ethical conduct from all employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm
to review internal control, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors, and employees
have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s annual financial statements. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors
approved, that the consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report. The Audit Committee also appointed KPMG LLP to serve as the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2020.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 26, 2019 and May 27,
2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
years in the three-year period ended May 26, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 26, 2019,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9a Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in

51

Table of Contents

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.
Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May.

Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 for
additional information.

Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil
Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia & Latin America segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar.
Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our
consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories
are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings
currently.

Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the related
finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and
depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings
are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are
retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation
and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 26, 2019, assets held for sale were insignificant.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group)
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the
asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely

58

Table of Contents

independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair
value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment
may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of the
fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the
fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires
allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We
recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill
allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are
determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market
comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on
useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such
as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and
expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue
Buffalo
, Pillsbury
, Totino’s
, Yoplait
, Old
El
Paso
,
Progresso
, Annie’s
, Häagen-Dazs
, and Yoki
brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which
included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have
identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount
of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or
losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of
certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital
investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.

In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a
result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The
significant assumptions

59

Table of Contents

used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates,
and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was
less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment
to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.

Redeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in
Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December
2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as
the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, we adjusted
the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value
include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a
discount rate.

Revenue Recognition
Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the delivery of
product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the
product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling
charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion,
consumer coupon redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-
added, and other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and
performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in
management estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we
may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables
from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection patterns are short-term, and vary around the world and by channel, and as such,
we do not have any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit
losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off
against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material contract assets or liabilities
arising from our contracts with customers.

Environmental Costs
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities
for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the
completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.

Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

60

Table of Contents

Research and Development
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product and
manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to
R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-end
exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are
reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in
net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and
foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.

Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are
recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or
other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.
Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying
hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in
earnings in the current period.

Stock-based Compensation
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share of our stock on the
date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally, stock-based compensation is recognized
straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees
and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent
service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the
period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under
certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with
service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans
are unfunded.

61

Table of Contents

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in
the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.

In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in
the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan
(Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.
The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the
Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment
strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the
Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated
with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of
our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotional
expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension,
other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

New Accounting Standards
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net
periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively “net periodic benefit expense”). The new standard
requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible
for capitalization. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the
capitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profit
of $87.9 million, $89.4 million and $74.3 million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan non-service income of $87.9 million, $89.4 million and
$74.3 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. There were no changes to our reported segment operating profit.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new
standard, we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amount
that reflects the consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The principles-based five step model includes: 1)
identifying the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determining the transaction price; 4) allocating the
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We utilized a
comprehensive approach to evaluate and document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices. We did not identify any
material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our
business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of the
new standard and subsequent amendments to all contracts in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach.

62

Table of Contents

We recorded a $33.9 million cumulative effect adjustment net of income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to
deferred income taxes of $11.4 million, and an increase to other current liabilities of $45.3 million related to the timing of recognition of certain
promotional expenditures.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the
accounting is not complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not available, prepared, or analyzed to determine a
reasonable estimate, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to
finalize the accounting related to the TCJA. In fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from
the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained
earnings. This reclassification consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new
accounting requirements allowed for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the provisional amounts
recorded.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidance
resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We retrospectively adopted the guidance
related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits, which resulted in reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities
in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax
withholdings, which resulted in reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the
amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to be
measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of the first day of the second quarter of
fiscal 2018, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a
practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidance
retrospectively and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations
or financial position.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with
a month-end to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest
to the entity’s fiscal year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
our results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES

During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a pre-tax loss of
$35.4 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our

63

Table of Contents

yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait
brand. We
recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.4 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion,
including $103.0 million of consideration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with the definitive agreement and plan of merger,
a subsidiary of General Mills merged into Blue Buffalo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In
accordance with the merger agreement, equity holders of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per share in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of
$6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. In fiscal 2019, we recorded acquisition integration costs of $25.6 million in SG&A expenses.
In fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition transaction and integration costs of $34.0 million in SG&A expenses and $49.9 million in interest, net related to the
debt issued to finance the acquisition.

We consolidated Blue Buffalo into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3 billion, an indefinite-lived intangible asset for the Blue
Buffalo
brand of $2.7 billion, and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of $269.0 million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth
opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductible
for tax purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6 million
increase to goodwill.

The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our Pet operating segment on a one-month lag.

The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information is presented as if we had acquired Blue Buffalo at the beginning of fiscal 2017:

The fiscal 2017 pro forma amounts include transaction and integration costs of $83.9 million and the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at
fair value of $52.7 million. The fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 pro forma amounts include interest expense of $238.7 million on the debt issued to finance the
transaction and amortization expense of $13.5 million based on the estimated fair value and useful life of the customer relationships intangible asset.
Additionally, the pro forma amounts include an increase to cost of sales by $1.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2018 to reflect the impact of
using the LIFO method of inventory valuation on Blue Buffalo’s historical operating results. Pro forma amounts include related tax effects of
$125.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $14.5 million in fiscal 2018. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results had the acquisition
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017 or of future results.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $192.6 million charge related to the impairment of our Progresso
, Food
Should
Taste
Good
, and Mountain
High
brand
intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Please see Note 6 for additional information.

In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $14.8 million charge in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs related to the impairment of certain manufacturing
assets in our North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segments.

64

Table of Contents

In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Yoki
, Mountain
High
, and Immaculate
Baking
brand intangible assets in
restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs.

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and
net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the
case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs,
including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation
associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense
caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved
restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.

Charges recorded in fiscal 2019 were as follows:

$ 77.6

In fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In our North America Retail segment, we
approved actions at certain facilities to consolidate production and optimize our labor and manufacturing platforms. In connection with these actions we will
exit our Carson, California yogurt manufacturing facility. We expect to incur approximately $101 million of restructuring charges related to these actions,
including $10 million of severance expense and $91 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We also expect to incur approximately $2 million of
project-related costs. We recorded $9.9 million of severance and $44.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we approved targeted systems
and process optimization actions in our Europe & Australia segment and expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring charges, including
$11 million of severance expense and $4 million of other costs. We recorded $11.3 million of severance and $0.7 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In
fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming product lines in our Asia & Latin America segment and expect to incur approximately $14 million of
restructuring charges, including $1 million of severance expense and $13 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We recorded $1.0 million of
severance and $11.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming markets in our Pet segment and expect to incur
approximately $8 million of restructuring charges, including $2 million of severance expense and $6 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We
recorded $0.8 million of severance and $0.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019.

Certain of these global supply chain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required. We expect to spend
approximately $35 million of cash related to these actions and spent $1.7 million in fiscal 2019. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of
fiscal 2022.

In fiscal 2019, we paid $49.3 million in cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.

approximately $40 million.

In fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment and we recorded $5.3 billion of goodwill, $2.7 billion related to an
indefinite-lived brand intangible asset, and $269.0 million related to a customer relationships intangible asset. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we
recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6 million increase to goodwill.

There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, we realized $6.8 million of gains from the sale of
available-for-sale marketable securities. Gains and losses are determined by specific identification. Classification of marketable securities as current or
noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period and the security’s maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI within stockholders’ equity.

As of May 26, 2019, we had $2.3 million of certain marketable debt securities pledged as collateral for derivative contracts. As of May 26, 2019,
$34.8 million of certain accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted line of credit.

The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $13,272.8 million and $13,021.3 million, respectively, as of
May 26, 2019. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and
equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established
policies.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk
for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel
fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of

70

Table of Contents

commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with
suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market
conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible.

We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for
commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings.

Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing
certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance
these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing
affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to
realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 included:

In Millions
Net gain (loss) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions
Net loss on commodity positions reclassified from unallocated corporate items to

segment operating profit

Net mark-to-market revaluation of certain grain inventories

As of May 26, 2019, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $312.5 million, of which $242.9 million related to agricultural inputs and
$69.6 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary
exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward-
starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a
desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a
counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of
debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on
the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and
losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2019, a $2.6 million loss in fiscal 2018, and less
than $1 million in fiscal 2017.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes
in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using

71

Table of Contents

incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and the
underlying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.4 million gain in fiscal 2019, a $3.4 million loss in
fiscal 2018, and a $4.3 million gain in fiscal 2017.

In advance of planned debt financing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0 million of treasury locks due April 19, 2018, with
an average fixed rate of 2.9 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $43.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with
the issuance of our $850.0 million 5.5-year fixed-rate notes, $800.0 million 7-year fixed-rate notes, $1,400.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes,
$500.0 million 20-year fixed-rate notes, and $650.0 million 30-year fixed-rate notes.

In advance of planned debt financing, in fiscal 2018, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks due October 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of
1.8 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $3.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our
$500.0 million 5-year fixed-rate notes.

As of May 26, 2019, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified to earnings over the
remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases,
intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S.
dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen,

72

Table of Contents

Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We
also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the
functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or
losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.

As of May 26, 2019, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $1,008.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than
$1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.

We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing
euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 26, 2019, we hedged a portion of these net investments with
€2,200.0 million of euro denominated bonds. As of May 26, 2019, we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of $51.5 million in AOCI
associated with net investment hedging activity.

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued.
We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 26, 2019, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $169.1 million. These swap contracts
mature in fiscal 2020.

The net amount of pre-tax gains and losses in AOCI as of May 26, 2019 that we expect to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months is a
$7.2 million net gain.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the major
credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on
derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in
a liability position on May 26, 2019, was $7.4 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features
underlying these agreements had been triggered on May 26, 2019, we would have been required to post $7.4 million of collateral to counterparties.

No customer other than Walmart accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales.

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated
counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure
to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not
incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges.

The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is
$2.4 million against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security
to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury
instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.

We offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party services also allow suppliers
to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing
arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable
remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May 26, 2019, $1,049.8 million of our accounts payable is payable to
suppliers who utilize these third party services.

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Our principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills Cereals,
LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $4.9 million as of May 26, 2019.

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal holds the
remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent euro-denominated
interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest
to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends
annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders’ agreement. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value of the euro-denominated
redeemable interest was $551.7 million.

On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and
50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques
SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to
Yoplait
 and related trademarks. Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a
royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to
Liberté
 and related trademarks. These entities pay
dividends annually based on their available cash as of their fiscal year end.

We paid dividends of $22.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $37.7 million in fiscal 2018 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC,
and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements.

A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined prices
through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $210.8 million for fiscal 2019 and $230.8 million for fiscal 2018.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $55.7 million in Yoplait SAS.

The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating
preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1,
2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred return
rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries are included
in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to
redeemable and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can
be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading
plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.

On March 27, 2018, we issued 22.7 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share, at a public offering price of $44.00 per share
for total proceeds of $1.0 billion. We paid $30.1 million in issuance costs, that were recorded in additional paid-in capital. The net proceeds of
$969.9 million were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Blue Buffalo.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from
the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained
earnings. Please see Note 14 for additional information.

NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 26, 2019, a total of
30.3 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestricted stock under the
2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and
performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and
2011 compensation plans for non-employee directors, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential accelerated
vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.

Stock Options
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions
regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using
the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in
estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our
stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.

85

Table of Contents

Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and
employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated
into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest
rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall
tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax
deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We recognized windfall tax
benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $24.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $25.5 million in
fiscal 2018.

Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant. Options
generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2017 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted four
years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales
growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to a three year performance and
vesting period. The sale or transfer of these

86

Table of Contents

awards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled to
vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive
payment if the awards vest.

NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for
salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each
year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal
U.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering
salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a
change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension
plan.

In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in
the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan
(Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged.
The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the
Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment
strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the
Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with
the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants.

Table of Contents

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health
care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and
retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates
Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:

Health care cost trend rate for next year
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate

Fiscal Year
2019
6.4% and 6.7%
4.5%
2029

2018
6.7% and 7.0%
4.5%
2029

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information
provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used
by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and
short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65
at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are
applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary,
to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health
care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and
Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate
with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit
plans are unfunded.

Discount Rates
We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the
yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of
May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31
to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We
work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median
corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is
applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

There were no material changes in our level 3 investments in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future
long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We
review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly
influence our evaluation.

Weighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a
reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across
investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 18 percent to
equities in the United States; 11 percent to international equities; 9 percent to private equities; 48 percent to fixed income; and 14 percent to real assets (real
estate, energy, and infrastructure). For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18 percent to equities in the
United States; 10 percent to international equities; 4 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 3 percent to real assets (real estate, energy,
and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments
We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in
fiscal 2020. Actual fiscal 2020 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our
benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected
to be paid from fiscal 2020 to 2029 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union employees. This plan is a
401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We
sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net assets of $22.3 million as of May 26, 2019, and $23.9 million as of
May 27, 2018. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution
plans was $52.7 million in fiscal 2019, $49.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $54.1 million in fiscal 2017.

We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment options of the
participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 5.1 million as of May 26, 2019, and
5.6 million as of May 27, 2018. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.

The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $410.1 million and $392.1 million of Company common stock as of May 26, 2019 and May 27,
2018, respectively.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence does not suggest we
will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the carryforward period to allow

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a
reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings.
As a result of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5 million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the
tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred
tax liability. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and
currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in
future periods.

The legislation also includes provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on
domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as
currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the
repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.

While the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by
foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make
an accounting policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. In fiscal 2018,
we made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period cost.

As of May 26, 2019, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our foreign operations
because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral
transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for
earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our
assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent
reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related
to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future
earnings.

In addition, in fiscal 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02: Income
Statement

Reporting
Comprehensive
Income
(Topic

(ASU
2018-02), which provides the option to reclassify stranded income tax

Table of Contents

effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million
from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate
tax rate.

We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an
uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular
uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related
interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and
state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction,
but are generally from 3 to 5 years.

Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by
$40.9 million. We determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. We have
effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.

During fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years.
These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB has
proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and
intend to contest the disallowance.

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected
ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Approximately $81.2 million of this total in fiscal 2019 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future
periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities below would impact deferred
taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 26, 2019, we expect to pay approximately $2.0 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months. We
are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The
remaining amount of our unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities.

We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2019, we recognized $0.5 million of
tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $26.0 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 26, 2019. For fiscal 2018, we recognized a net
benefit of $3.1 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $27.3 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 27, 2018.

NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES

Our leases are generally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations was $184.9 million in
fiscal 2019, $189.4 million in fiscal 2018, and $188.1 million in fiscal 2017.

Some operating leases require payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent
in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant.

Depreciation on capital leases is recorded as depreciation expense in our results of operations.

As of May 26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $681.6 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and
guarantees and comfort letters of $133.9 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance
sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $482.6 million as of May 26, 2019.

NOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in the packaged foods industry. Our operating segments are as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe &
Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet.

Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food
chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers. Our product categories in this business
segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and
pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition bars, meal kits,
salty snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and grain snacks.

100

Table of Contents

Our major product categories in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen
meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to
our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket
bakeries in the United States.

Our Europe & Australia operating segment reflects retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and Australia regions. Our product categories
include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, super-premium ice cream, refrigerated and frozen dough products, shelf stable vegetables, grain snacks, and dessert
and baking mixes. We also sell super-premium ice cream directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Revenues from franchise fees are reported in
the region or country where the franchisee is located.

Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia and South America regions. Our product
categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, meal kits, salty and
grain snacks, wellness beverages, and refrigerated yogurt. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts directly to consumers through owned
retail shops. Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin
American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are
reported in the region or country where the end customer or franchisee is located.

Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, e-commerce retailers, grocery
stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet
foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address
specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and
textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not
include Pet segment operating results.

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs.
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the
General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other
items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain
inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items
affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive
management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our
operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor
available by operating segment.

Table of Contents

Glossary

Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets. The increase in depreciation expense caused by updating the salvage value and shortening
the useful life of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan, but only if impairment is not present.

AOCI . Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Adjusted diluted EPS. Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Adjusted EBITDA. The calculation of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, and depreciation and
amortization adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Adjusted operating profit. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Adjusted operating profit margin. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability, divided by net sales.

Constant currency. Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the
comparable prior-year period. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual
average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies
multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal
year.

Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.

Derivatives. Financial instruments such as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The calculation of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from
joint ventures, net interest, depreciation and amortization.

Euribor. European Interbank Offered Rate.

Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the assumptions (inputs)
used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management
judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:

Level 1:

   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.

Level 3:

   Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

Focus 6 platforms. The Focus 6 platforms for the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment consist of cereal, yogurt, snacks, frozen meals, biscuits, and
baking mixes.

107

Table of Contents

Free cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of land, buildings, and equipment.

Free cash flow conversion rate. Free cash flow divided by our net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests
adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are required to use in recording and reporting
accounting information in our financial statements.

Goodwill. The difference between the purchase price of acquired companies plus the fair value of any noncontrolling and redeemable interests and the
related fair values of net assets acquired.

Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales.

Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the
hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for certain hedging instruments and hedged items only if the hedging relationship
is highly effective, and only prospectively from the date a hedging relationship is formally documented.

Holistic Margin Management (HMM). Company-wide initiative to use productivity savings, mix management, and price realization to offset input cost
inflation, protect margins, and generate funds to reinvest in sales-generating activities.

Interest bearing instruments. Notes payable, long-term debt, including current portion, cash and cash equivalents, and certain interest bearing investments
classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.

LIBOR. London Interbank Offered Rate.

Mark-to-market. The act of determining a value for financial instruments, commodity contracts, and related assets or liabilities based on the current
market price for that item.

Net debt. Long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents.

Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts that will be allocated to
segment operating profit when the exposure we are hedging affects earnings.

Net price realization. The impact of list and promoted price changes, net of trade and other price promotion costs.

Net realizable value. The estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and
transportation.

Noncontrolling interests. Interests of consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties.

Notional principal amount. The principal amount on which fixed-rate or floating-rate interest payments are calculated.

OCI. Other comprehensive income (loss).

Organic net sales growth.  Net sales growth adjusted for foreign currency translation, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week impact, when
applicable.

Project-related costs.  Costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives not included in restructuring charges.

Redeemable interest. Interest of consolidated subsidiaries held by a third party that can be redeemed outside of our control and therefore cannot be
classified as a noncontrolling interest in equity.

Reporting unit. An operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment.

Strategic Revenue Management (SRM). A company-wide capability focused on generating sustainable benefits from net price realization and mix by

ITEM 9A    Controls and Procedures

We, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 1934 Act). Based on that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of May 26, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is (1) recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act) during our fiscal quarter ended
May 26, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control
–

Framework
(2013)
.

Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal
Control
–
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
, management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of May 26, 2019.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Exhibit 4.3

As of May 26, 2019, General Mills, Inc. (“General Mills,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) had five classes of securities registered

under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): our Common Stock; our Floating Rate Notes due 2020; our
2.100% Notes due 2020; our 1.000% Notes due 2023; and our 1.500% Notes due 2027.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

The following description of our Common Stock and our cumulative preference stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is

subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our By-laws, as
amended (the “By-laws”), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to
read our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-laws and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) for
additional information.

General

Our Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of one billion shares of our Common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and
five million shares of cumulative preference stock, without par value, issuable in series. Our Common Stock is listed and principally traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GIS.” All outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.

Dividend Rights

The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available

for that purpose, provided that if any shares of preference stock are at the time outstanding, the payment of dividends on Common Stock or other
distributions (including purchases of Common Stock) may be subject to the declaration and payment of full cumulative dividends, and the absence of
overdue amounts in any mandatory sinking fund, on outstanding shares of preference stock.

Voting Rights

The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including the election of

directors, subject to the voting rights of any preference stock then outstanding. The holders of Common Stock are not entitled to cumulative voting of their
shares in the election of directors. Directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in
person or represented by proxy, provided that if the number of nominees standing for election at any meeting of the stockholders exceeds the number of
directors to be elected, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Except as provided by law, all other matters are to be decided by a vote
of a majority of votes cast by the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in any assets

remaining after the satisfaction in full of the prior rights of creditors, including holders of our indebtedness, and the aggregate liquidation preference of any
preference stock then outstanding.

Other Rights and Preferences

The holders of Common Stock do not have any conversion rights or any preemptive rights to subscribe for stock or any other securities of the

Company. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Common Stock.

Effect of Preference Shares

Our Board of Directors is authorized to approve the issuance of one or more series of preference stock without further authorization of our

stockholders and to fix the number of shares, the designations, the relative rights and the limitations of any series of preference stock. As a result, our Board
of Directors, without stockholder approval, could authorize the issuance of preference stock with voting, conversion and other rights that could
proportionately reduce, minimize or otherwise adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of Common Stock or other series of preference

our 2023 Notes and €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes on April 27, 2015, and €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our
Floating Rate Notes on January 15, 2016. The 2020 Notes, 2023 Notes, 2027 Notes and Floating Rate Notes are listed and principally traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbols “GIS20,” “GIS23A,” “GIS27” and “GIS20A,” respectively. As of May 26, 2019, €500,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of the 2020 Notes, €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes, €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2027
Notes and €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes were outstanding.

The Floating Rate Notes, the 2020 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2027 Notes were each issued as a separate series of securities under the
Indenture. The Notes and the Indenture are governed by, and are to be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed wholly within the State of New York.

Interest and Maturity

2020,
2023
and
2027
Notes
. The 2020 Notes will mature on November 16, 2020, the 2023 Notes will mature on April 27, 2023, and the 2027

Notes will mature on April 27, 2027. We will pay interest on the 2020 Notes at the rate of 2.100% per year annually in arrears on November 16 of each year
to holders of record on the preceding November 1. We will pay interest on the 2023 Notes at the rate of 1.000% per year annually in arrears on April 27 of
each year, beginning April 27, 2016, to holders of record on the preceding April 12. We will pay interest on the 2027 Notes at the rate of 1.500% per year
annually in arrears on April 27 of each year, beginning April 27, 2016, to holders of record on the preceding April 12. Interest payments for the 2020 Notes
include accrued interest from and including November 15, 2013 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided
for, as the case may be, to but excluding the interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payments for the 2023 and 2027
Notes include accrued interest from and including April 27, 2015 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided
for, as the case may be, to but excluding the next interest payment date or the date of maturity, as the case may be. Interest payable at the maturity of the
2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes will be payable to the registered holders of the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes to whom the principal is payable.

Interest on the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being

calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to but excluding the
next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International
Capital Market Association. If any interest payment date on the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest payment will
be postponed to the next day that is a business day, and no interest on that payment will accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the
maturity date of the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next
succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the maturity date.

“Business day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated

by law or executive order to close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express
Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates.

Floating
Rate
Notes
. The Floating Rate Notes bear interest from January 15, 2016 at a floating rate determined in the manner provided below,

payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year and on the maturity date of the Floating Rate Notes (each, an
“interest payment date”), beginning on April 15, 2016 to the persons in whose names the Floating Rate Notes are registered at the close of business on the
15th calendar day (whether or not a business day) immediately preceding the related interest payment date or, if the Floating Rate Notes are represented by
one or more global notes, the close of business on the business day (for this purpose a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear are open for business)
immediately preceding the related interest payment date; provided, however, that interest payable on the maturity date or any redemption date shall be
payable to the person to whom the principal of such Floating Rate Notes shall be payable.

If any interest payment date (other than the maturity date or any earlier repayment date) falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest

payment date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day and interest will accrue to but excluding such interest payment date, except that if such
business day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, the applicable interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day. If the
maturity date or any earlier redemption date of the Floating Rate Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment of principal, premium, if any,
and interest, if any, otherwise payable on such date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment will accrue from
and after the maturity date or earlier redemption date, as applicable. The rights of holders of beneficial interests of Floating Rate Notes to receive the
payments of interest on such Floating Rate Notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The interest rate is reset quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 (each an “interest reset date”). However, if any interest reset
date would otherwise be a day that is not a business day, such interest reset date will be the next succeeding day that is a business day, except that if the next
succeeding business day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, the applicable interest reset date will be the immediately preceding business day.

The initial interest period was the period from and including January 15, 2016 to but excluding the first interest reset date. The interest rate in

effect during the initial interest period was equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%), determined two TARGET system days prior to January 15,
2016. A “TARGET system day” is any day in which the TARGET2 System, or any successor thereto, is open for business and a day on which commercial
banks are open for dealings in euro deposits in the London interbank market. With respect to Floating Rate Notes in certificated form, the reference to
business day will also mean a day on which banking institutions generally are open for business in the location of each office of a transfer agent, but only
with respect to a payment or other action to occur at that office.

After the initial interest period, the interest periods are the periods from and including an interest reset date to but excluding the immediately
succeeding interest reset date, except that the final interest period will be the period from and including the interest reset date immediately preceding the
maturity date to but excluding the maturity date (each an “interest period”). The interest rate per annum for the Floating Rate Notes in any interest period
will be equal to EURIBOR plus 73 basis points (0.73%) (the “interest rate”), as determined by the calculation agent. The interest rate in effect for the 15
calendar days prior to any redemption date earlier than the maturity date will be the interest rate in effect on the fifteenth day preceding such earlier
redemption date.

The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is limited to the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by

United States law of general application, and shall not be less than 0.00%

Upon the request of any holder of Floating Rate Notes, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the

interest rate that will become effective on the next interest reset date.

The calculation agent will determine EURIBOR for each interest period on the second TARGET system day prior to the first day of such

interest period (the “interest determination date”).

“EURIBOR” with respect to any interest determination date will be the offered rate for deposits of euros having a maturity of three months that

appears on “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such interest determination date. If on an interest determination
date, such rate does not appear on the “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, or if “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” is not available on
such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.’s page “BBAM.” If no offered rate appears on “Reuters Page EURIBOR 01” or
Bloomberg L.P.’s page “BBAM” on an interest determination date, EURIBOR will be determined for such interest determination date on the basis of the
rates at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such interest determination date at which deposits in euros are offered to prime banks in the euro-zone
inter-bank market by the principal euro-zone office of each of four major banks in such market selected and identified by us (the “reference banks”), for a
term of three months commencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is representative for a
single transaction in euros in such market at such time. We will ensure the calculation agent is

provided with the complete contact details of the relevant personnel at each of the reference banks that they will be required to contact in order to obtain the
relevant interest rate. The calculation agent will request the principal euro-zone office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two
such quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of such quotations. If fewer than two such
quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such interest period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such interest determination date by three major banks in the euro-zone, selected and identified by us, for loans in euros to leading
European banks, for a term of three months, commencing on the applicable interest reset date and in a principal amount of not less than €1,000,000 that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected are not quoting as mentioned above, the
then-existing EURIBOR rate will remain in effect for such interest period, or, if none, the interest rate will be the initial interest rate.

All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the Floating Rate Notes are rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one

hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be
rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all euro amounts are rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. The amount of interest
payable in respect of each note is calculated by applying the applicable interest rate for such interest period to the outstanding principal amount of such
Floating Rate Notes, multiplying the product by the actual number of days in such interest period and dividing by 360. Each calculation of the interest rate
on the Floating Rate Notes by the calculation agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on us, the trustee and the holders of the
Floating Rate Notes.

Payments in Euro

All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, is payable in euro. If the euro is

unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then
member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or
within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in dollars until the euro is again available to us or so
used. The amount payable on any date in euro is converted into dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any
payment in respect of the Notes so made in dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture governing the Notes. Neither the
trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.

Issuance of Additional Notes

We may, without the consent of the holders of Notes, issue additional Notes having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and
other terms as a series of the Notes (except for the public offering price and issue date and, in some cases, the first interest payment date). Any additional
Notes, together with the Notes with the same terms, will constitute a single series of Notes under the Indenture; provided that, if the additional Notes are not
fungible with the Notes in this offering for United States federal income tax purposes, the additional Notes will have different ISIN and CUSIP numbers. No
additional Notes of a series may be issued if an event of default has occurred with respect to that series of Notes.

Ranking

The Notes are our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes rank equal in priority with all of our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes effectively rank junior to
all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, because the Notes are only
our obligation and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries, creditors of each of our subsidiaries, including trade creditors and owners of preferred equity of
our subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of our creditors, including holders of
the Notes. The Notes, therefore, are effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries, and to claims of owners
of preferred equity of our subsidiaries.

Redemption

The Floating Rate Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity except upon certain tax events described below. See “Redemption for Tax

Reasons.”

As discussed below, we may redeem the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes before they mature. The 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes to be redeemed will

stop bearing interest on the redemption date. We will give holders of 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes between 15 and 45 days’ notice before the redemption date.

We are not required (i) to register, transfer or exchange the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes during the period from the opening of business 15 days
before the day a notice of redemption relating to the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes selected for redemption is sent to the close of business on the day that notice
is sent, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes so selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any 2020,
2023 or 2027 Notes being redeemed in part.

We may redeem the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time. The redemption price for the 2020 Notes
to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to August 16, 2020 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to the greater
of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on the 2020 Notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption)
discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined
below), plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2020 Notes to be
redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after August 16, 2020 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the 2020 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Notes to the date of redemption.
The redemption price for the 2023 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2023 (the date that is three months prior to the
maturity date) will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent
investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2023 notes to be
redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis
(ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2023 Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after January 27,
2023 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes being redeemed on the
redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2027 Notes to be redeemed on
any redemption date that is prior to January 27, 2027 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the
principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed and (2) as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us, the sum of the present values
of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2027 Notes to be redeemed (excluding any portion of such payments of interest
accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable
Government Bond Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The redemption price for the 2027
Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after January 27, 2027 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date) will be equal to
100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes being redeemed on the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2027 Notes to the date of
redemption. In any case, the principal amount of a 2020, 2023 or 2027 Note remaining outstanding after a redemption in part shall be €100,000 or an
integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

In connection with such optional redemption of 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes, the following defined terms apply:

•

•

  “Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005
being rounded upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined
below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business
day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.

  “Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent
investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes to be redeemed, or if such
independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such
independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us,
determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

The 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving United States taxation. If any
of these special tax events occur, the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. See “Redemption for Tax Reasons.”

Payment of Additional Amounts

We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional amounts as are

necessary in order that the net payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes to a holder of the Notes (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such
holder holds the Notes) who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or
other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a

taxing authority in the United States, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the
foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:

(1) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such

holder holds such note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation,
or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as:

(a) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a permanent establishment in the

United States;

(b) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of

the Notes or the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights thereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the United
States;

United States income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;

(c) being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation for

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any successor provision; or

(d) being or having been a “10-percent shareholder” of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal

(e) being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of

its trade or business;

(2) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or limited liability
company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the holder, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner
or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor,
beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;

(3) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the holder or any other person

to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the
United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority
therein or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(4) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by us or an applicable paying or

withholding agent from the payment;

(5) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a change in law, regulation, or administrative

or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(6) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other

governmental charge;

(7) to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made pursuant to any law

implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings;

(8) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or

interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;

(9) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of any note,

where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which
payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(10) with respect to the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by

reason of the beneficial owner being a bank (i) purchasing the Notes in the ordinary course of its lending

business or (ii) that is neither (A) buying the Notes for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Notes for resale to a third-party that either is not a bank
or holding the Notes for investment purposes only;

(11) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor

provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code or any
fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation
of such sections of the Code; or

(12) in the case of any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).

The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Notes.
Except as specifically provided under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts,” we are not required to make any payment for any tax, assessment or
other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.

As used under this heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “Redemption for Tax Reasons”, the term “United States”
means the United States of America, the states of the United States, and the District of Columbia, and the term “United States person” means any individual
who is a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized
in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to
United States federal income taxation regardless of its source.

To the extent permitted by law, we maintain a paying agent in a Member State of the European Union (if any) that will not require withholding
or deduction of tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or
introduced in order to conform to, such European Council Directive.

Redemption for Tax Reasons

If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or
any taxing authority in the United States), or any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws,
regulations or rulings, we become or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts
as described under the heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to the Notes, then we may at any time at our option redeem, in whole, but
not in part, any series of the Notes on not less than 15 nor more than 45 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount,
together with accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.

Change of Control Offer to Purchase

If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of Notes may require us to repurchase all or any part (equal to an integral multiple of

€1,000) of their Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to the date of purchase
(unless, in the case of the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes, a notice of redemption has been mailed within 30 days after such change of control triggering event
stating that all of the Notes of such series will be redeemed as described above); provided that the principal amount of a Note remaining outstanding after a
repurchase in part shall be €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. We are required to mail to holders of the Notes a notice describing
the transaction or transactions constituting the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase the Notes. The notice must be mailed within 30
days after any change of control triggering event, and the repurchase must occur no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days after the date the notice is
mailed.

On the date specified for repurchase of the Notes, we will, to the extent lawful:

  accept for payment all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes;

  deposit with the paying agent the required payment for all properly tendered Notes or portions of Notes; and

  deliver to the trustee the repurchased Notes, accompanied by an officers’ certificate stating, among other things, the aggregate principal amount

of repurchased Notes.

We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other securities laws and

regulations applicable to the repurchase of the Notes. To the extent that these requirements conflict with the provisions requiring repurchase of the Notes,
we will comply with these requirements instead of the repurchase provisions and will not

be considered to have breached our obligations with respect to repurchasing the Notes. Additionally, if an event of default exists under the Indenture (which
is unrelated to the repurchase provisions of the Notes), including events of default arising with respect to other issues of debt securities, we will not be
required to repurchase the Notes notwithstanding these repurchase provisions.

We will not be required to comply with the obligations relating to repurchasing the Notes if a third party instead satisfies them.

For purposes of the repurchase provisions of the Notes, the following terms are applicable:

“ Change
of
control
” means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any
merger or consolidation) resulting in any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (other than
us or one of our subsidiaries) becoming the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),
directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our voting stock or other voting stock into which our voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or
changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (b) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way
of merger or consolidation), in a transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, to one or more “persons” (as that term is defined in the Indenture) (other than us or one of our subsidiaries); or (c) the first day on which a
majority of the members of our Board of Directors are not continuing directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a
change of control if (a) we become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b)(y) immediately following that transaction,
the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the holders of our voting stock immediately prior to
that transaction or (z) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock
of the holding company.

“ Change
of
control
triggering
event
” means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.

“ Continuing
directors
” means, as of any date of determination, any member of our Board of Directors who (a) was a member of the Board of
Directors on the date the Notes were issued or (b) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority
of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or
by approval of our proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).

“ Fitch
” means Fitch Ratings.

“ Investment
grade
rating
” means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody’s and

BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies selected by us.

“ Moody’s
” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

“ Rating
agencies
” means (a) each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P; and (b) if any of Fitch, Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to

make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of our control, a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” (as defined in
Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) selected by us as a replacement rating agency for a former rating agency.

“ Rating
event
” means the rating on the Notes is lowered by each of the rating agencies and the Notes are rated below an investment grade

rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under
publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a change of control and
(b) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or our intention to effect a change of control; provided that a rating event will not be deemed to
have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of change of control
triggering event) if each rating agency making the reduction in rating does not publicly announce or confirm or inform the trustee in writing at our request
that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the change of
control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event).

“ S&P
” means Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

“ Voting
stock
” means, with respect to any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

as amended) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such
person.

Sinking Fund

The Notes are not subject to, or entitled to the benefit of, any sinking fund.

Conversion or Exchange Rights

The Notes are not convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock or other securities.

Certain Restrictive Covenants

The Indenture contains restrictive covenants that apply the Notes, the most significant of which are described below.

Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries

Some of our property may be subject to a mortgage or other legal mechanism that gives our lenders preferential rights in that property over
other lenders, including direct holders of the Notes, or over our general creditors, if we fail to pay them back. These preferential rights are called “liens.”
The Indenture restricts our ability to create, issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by a mortgage, pledge,
lien, security interest or other encumbrance on:

•

•

  any flour mill, manufacturing or packaging plant or research laboratory located in the United States or Canada owned by us or one of our

current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries; or

  any stock or debt issued by one of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries

unless we also secure all the Notes that are still outstanding under the Indenture equally with the indebtedness being secured. This promise does not restrict
our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of our interests in any United States or Canadian operating subsidiary.

These requirements do not apply to liens:

  existing on February 1, 1996 and any extensions, renewals or replacements of those liens;

  relating to the construction, improvement or purchase of a flour mill, plant or laboratory;

  in favor of us or one of our United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries;

  in favor of governmental units for financing construction, improvement or purchase of our property;

  existing on any property, stock or debt existing at the time we acquire it, including liens on property, stock or debt of a United States or

Canadian operating subsidiary at the time it became our United States or Canadian operating subsidiary;

  relating to the sale of our property;

  for work done on our property;

  relating to workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and similar obligations;

  relating to litigation or legal judgments;

  for taxes, assessments or governmental charges not yet due; or

  consisting of easements or other restrictions, defects in title or encumbrances on our real property.

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

We may also avoid securing the Notes equally with the indebtedness being secured if the amount of the indebtedness being secured plus the
value of any sale and lease back transactions, as described below, is 15% or less than the amount of our consolidated total assets minus our consolidated
non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.

If a merger or other transaction would create any liens that are not permitted as described above, we must grant an equivalent lien to the direct

holders of the Notes.

Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

The Indenture also provides that we and our United States and Canadian operating subsidiaries will not enter into any sale and leaseback

transactions on any of our flourmills, manufacturing or packaging plants or research laboratories located in the United States or Canada owned by us or one
of our current or future United States or Canadian operating subsidiaries (“principal properties”) unless we satisfy some restrictions. A sale and leaseback
transaction involves our sale to a lender or other investor of a property of ours and our leasing back that property from that party for more than three years,
or a sale of a property to, and its lease back for three or more years from, another person who borrows the necessary funds from a lender or other investor on
the security of the property.

•

•

•

We may enter into a sale and leaseback transaction covering any of our principal properties only if:

  it falls into the exceptions for liens described above under “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian

Operating Subsidiaries”; or

  within 180 days after the property sale, we set aside for the retirement of funded debt, meaning notes or bonds that mature at or may be

extended to a date more than 12 months after issuance, an amount equal to the greater of:

•

•

•

•

  the net proceeds of the sale of the principal property, or

  the fair market value of the principal property sold, and in either case, minus

  the principal amount of any debt securities issued under the Indenture that are delivered to the trustee for retirement within 120

days after the property sale, and

  the principal amount of any funded debt, other than debt securities issued under the Indenture, voluntarily retired by us within 120

days after the property sale; or

  the attributable value, as described below, of all sale and leaseback transactions plus any indebtedness that we incur that, but for the exception
in the second to last paragraph of “— Limitation on Liens on Major Property and United States and Canadian Operating Subsidiaries” above,
would have required us to secure the Notes equally with it, is 15% or less than the amount of our consolidated total assets minus our
consolidated non-interest bearing current liabilities, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.

We determine the attributable value of a sale and leaseback transaction by choosing the lesser of (1) or (2) below:

        1.

sale price of the leased property                  x

   remaining portion of the base

term of the lease
the base term of the lease

        2.

the total obligation of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining portion of the base term of the lease, discounted to present value at
the highest interest rate on any outstanding series of debt securities issued under the Indenture. The rental payments in this calculation do not
include amounts for property taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, water rates and other items that are not payments for the property itself.

Mergers and Similar Events

We are generally permitted under the Indenture to consolidate or merge with another company. We are also permitted to sell or lease some or

all of our assets to another company. However, we may not take any of these actions unless the following conditions, among others, are met:

•

•

  where we merge out of existence or sell or lease substantially all our assets, the other company must be a corporation, limited liability company,

partnership or trust organized under the laws of a state or the District of Columbia or under United States federal law and it must expressly
agree in a supplemental indenture to be legally responsible for the Notes; and

  the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not bring about a default on the Notes (for purposes of this test, a default would include an
event of default described below under “Default and Related Matters” and any event that would be an event of default if the requirements for
giving us notice of our default or our default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded).

There is no precise, established definition of what would constitute a sale or lease of substantially all of our assets under applicable law and,

accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale or lease of less than all of our assets would subject us to this provision.

If we merge out of existence or transfer (except through a lease) substantially all our assets, and the other firm becomes our successor and is

legally responsible for the Notes, we will be relieved of our own responsibility for the Notes.

Default and Related Matters

Noteholders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured. For each series of Notes the term “event of default” means

any of the following:

•

•

•

•

•

  we do not pay interest on a Note of that series within 30 days of its due date;

  we do not pay the principal or any premium on a Note of that series on its due date;

  we do not deposit money into a separate custodial account, known as a sinking fund, when such a deposit is due, if we agree to maintain a

sinking fund with respect to that series;

  we remain in breach of any restrictive covenant with respect to that series or any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after we receive a

notice of default stating we are in breach (the notice must be sent by either the trustee or direct holders of at least 25% of the principal amount
of Notes of the affected series); or

  we file for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.

In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding, all of the Notes will automatically be due and immediately payable. If a

non-bankruptcy event of default has occurred with respect to any series of Notes and has not been cured, the trustee or the direct holders of not less than
25% in principal amount of the Notes of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes of that series to be due and immediately
payable. This is called a “declaration of acceleration of maturity.”

A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the direct holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes of the

affected series if any other defaults on those Notes have been waived or cured and we pay or deposit with the trustee an amount sufficient to pay the
following with respect to the Notes of that series:

•

•

•

•

  all overdue interest;

  principal and premium, if any, which has become due, other than as a result of the acceleration, plus any interest on that principal;

  interest on overdue interest, to the extent that payment is lawful; and

  amounts paid or advanced by the trustee and reasonable trustee compensation and expenses.

Except in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the Indenture at the
request of any direct holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability, called an “indemnity.” If reasonable
indemnity is provided, the direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of the relevant series may direct the time, method and
place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. These majority direct holders may also direct the
trustee in exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee under the Indenture.

Before an investor may bypass the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce its rights or

protect its interests relating to any Notes of any series, the following must occur:

•

  the investor must give the trustee written notice that an event of default with respect to the Notes of that series has occurred and remains

uncured;

•

•

•

  the direct holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding Notes of that series must make a written request that the trustee take

action because of the default, and must offer reasonable indemnity to the trustee against any cost and liabilities of taking that action;

  the trustee must not have received from direct holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series a direction

inconsistent with the written notice; and

  the trustee must have failed to take action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.

However, investors are entitled at any time to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on a Note on or after its due date.

Every year we will certify in a written statement to the trustee that we are in compliance with the Indenture and each series of Notes or specify

any default that we know about.

Defeasance

The Floating Rate Notes are not subject to defeasance or covenant defeasance. In some circumstances described below, we may elect to

discharge our obligations on the 2020, 2023 and 2027 Notes through defeasance or covenant defeasance.

Full Defeasance

If there is a change in United States federal tax law as described below, we could legally release ourselves from any payment or other

obligations on the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes, called “full defeasance,” if we put in place the following arrangements for investors to be repaid:

•

•

  we must irrevocably deposit in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of those Notes money or specified German government securities or a
combination of these that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on those Notes on their various due
dates;

  there must be a change in current federal tax law or an Internal Revenue Service ruling that lets us make the deposit without causing investors
to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid such Notes ourselves (under current United
States federal tax law, the deposit and our legal release from the such Notes would be treated as though we took back such Notes and gave
investors their share of the cash and notes or bonds deposited in trust, in which case investors could recognize gain or loss on those Notes); and

•

  we must deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming the United States tax law change described above.

In addition, no default must have occurred and be continuing with respect to those Notes at the time the deposit is made (and, with respect only

to bankruptcy and similar events, during the 90 days following the deposit), and we have delivered a certificate and a legal opinion to the effect that the
deposit does not:

•

•

•

•

  cause any outstanding Notes to be delisted;

  cause the trustee to have a “conflicting interest” within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939;

  result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which we are party or by which we are

bound; and

  result in the trust arising from it constituting an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (unless we

register the trust, or find an exemption from registration, under that Act).

If we ever did accomplish full defeasance, investors would have to rely solely on the trust deposit, and could no longer look to us, for

repayment on the Notes of the affected series. Conversely, the trust deposit would likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we
ever become bankrupt or insolvent.

Covenant Defeasance

Under current United States federal tax law, we can make the same type of deposit described above and be released from many of the covenants

in the 2020, 2023 or 2027 Notes. This is called “covenant defeasance.” In that event, investors would lose the

protection of those covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the applicable series of Notes. In order
to achieve covenant defeasance, we must do the following:

•

•

•

•

•

  make the same deposit of money and/or German government securities described above under “— Full Defeasance;”

  deliver to the trustee a legal opinion confirming that under current United States federal income tax law we may make the above deposit

without causing investors to be taxed on the applicable series of Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit and simply repaid the
applicable series of Notes ourselves; and

  comply with the other conditions precedent described above under “— Full Defeasance.”

If we accomplish covenant defeasance, the following provisions, among others, would no longer apply:

  the events of default relating to breach of covenants described below under “Default and Related Matters;” and

  any promises regarding conduct of our business, such as those described under “Certain Restrictive Covenants” below and any other covenants

applicable to the series of Notes.

If we accomplish covenant defeasance, investors can still look to us for repayment of the applicable series of Notes if there is a shortfall in the

trust deposit. Depending on the event causing the default, however, investors may not be able to obtain payment of the shortfall.

Modification and Waiver

There are three types of changes we can make to the Indenture and the Notes.

First, there are changes that cannot be made to the Notes without specific investor approval. These include:

  change of the stated due date for payment of principal or interest on a series of Notes;

  reduction in the principal amount of, the rate of interest payable on or any premium payable upon redemption of a series of Notes;

  reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a series of Notes following a default;

  change in the place or currency of payment on a series of Notes;

  impairment of an investor’s right to sue for payment on a series of Notes on or after the due date for such payment;

  reduction in the percentage of direct holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required to modify or amend the Indenture;

  reduction in the percentage of holders of a series of Notes whose consent is required under the Indenture to waive compliance with provisions

of, or to waive defaults under, the Indenture; and

  modification of any of the provisions described above or other provisions of the Indenture dealing with waiver of defaults or covenants under

the Indenture, except to increase the percentages required for such waivers or to provide that other provisions of the Indenture cannot be
changed without the consent of each direct holder affected by the change.

Second, changes may be made by us and the trustee without any vote by holders of any series of Notes. These include:

  evidencing the assumption by a successor of our obligations under the Indenture and any series of Notes;

  adding to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of Notes, or surrendering any of our rights or powers under the Indenture;

  adding other events of default for the benefit of holders of any series of Notes;

  making such changes as may be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of any series of Notes in bearer or uncertificated form;

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

  establishing the forms or terms of any series of Notes;

  evidencing the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee; and

  curing any ambiguity, correcting any Indenture provision that may be defective or inconsistent with other Indenture provisions or making any

other change that does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of Notes in any material respect.

Third, we need a vote by direct holders of Notes owning at least a majority of the principal amount of each series affected by the change to
make any other change to the Indenture that is not of the type described in the preceding two paragraphs. A majority vote of this kind is also required to
obtain a waiver of any past default, except a payment default on principal or interest or concerning a provision of the Indenture that cannot be changed
without the consent of the direct holder.

When taking a vote, we will decide how much principal amount to attribute to a series of Notes by using the dollar equivalent, as determined by

our Board of Directors.

Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore will not be eligible to vote, if owned by us or one of our affiliates or if we have

deposited or set aside money in trust for their payment or redemption. Notes will also not be eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described
below under “Defeasance — Full Defeasance.”

We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the direct holders of outstanding Notes that are

entitled to vote or take other action under the Indenture. In some circumstances, generally related to a default by us on a series of the Notes, the trustee will
be entitled to set a record date for action by holders.

Trustee

U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee under the Indenture, has been appointed by us as paying agent and registrar with regard to the Notes.

The trustee also acts as an agent for the issuance of our United States commercial paper. The trustee and its affiliates currently provide cash management
and other banking and advisory services to us in the normal course of business and may from time to time in the future provide other banking and advisory
services to us in the ordinary course of business, in each case in exchange for a fee.

Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Note

We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank,

S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to
be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in this section reflects
our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they were in effect at the time of the issuance of the Notes of each series.
Those clearing systems could change their rules and procedures at any time.

The Notes are represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note is deposited with, or on behalf of, a common

depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below,
the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. Investors may hold interests in
the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants
in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers
through customers’ securities accounts in Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the Notes
and all transfers relating to the Notes are reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear.

The distribution of the Notes is cleared through Clearstream and Euroclear. Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the Notes

takes place through Clearstream and Euroclear participants and settles in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the Notes receive payments
relating to their Notes in euro, except as described under the heading “Payments in Euro.”

Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among
themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the Notes to be issued, held and transferred among the
clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate clearance and settlement have been established among these
clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary market.

The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the investor’s interest in the
Notes held by them. We have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear or any of their direct or indirect participants.
We also do not supervise these systems in any way.

Clearstream and Euroclear and their participants perform these clearance and settlement functions under agreements they have made with one
another or with their customers. Investors should be aware that they are not obligated to perform or continue to perform these procedures and may modify
them or discontinue them at any time.

Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes will not be entitled to have the Notes registered in their names, will not
receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the
Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a
beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant
through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes.

We have been advised by Clearstream and Euroclear, respectively, as follows:

Clearstream

Clearstream advises that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its

participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream
Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of
certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of
internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional
depositary, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance
du Secteur Financier). Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is also
available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream
Participant, either directly or indirectly.

Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream are credited to cash accounts of Clearstream

Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures.

Euroclear

Euroclear advises that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle

transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical
movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services, including
securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the
“Euroclear Operator”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts
are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other
professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.

The Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, or the Euroclear Terms
and Conditions, and applicable Belgian law govern securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Specifically, these terms
and conditions govern:

•

•

•

  transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear;

  withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear; and

  receipt of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear.

All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The
Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding
securities through Euroclear Participants.

Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear are credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear

Participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions.

Clearance and Settlement Procedures

We understand that investors that hold their Notes through Clearstream or Euroclear accounts will follow the settlement procedures that are

applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Notes are credited to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear participants on
the business day following the settlement date, for value on the settlement date. They are credited either free of payment or against payment for value on the
settlement date.

We understand that secondary market trading between Clearstream and/or Euroclear participants will occur in the ordinary way following the

applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. Secondary market trading is settled using procedures applicable to conventional
eurobonds in registered form.

Investors should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the
Notes through Clearstream and Euroclear on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when
banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the

same business day as in the United States. United States investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or
delivery of the Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels,
depending on whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.

Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in

accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case may
be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant only in
accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.

Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of

Clearstream and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those
procedures at any time.

Certificated Notes

If the depositary for any of the Notes of any series represented by a registered global note is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as

depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days, we will issue Notes of that series in definitive form in exchange for the
registered global note that had been held by the depositary. Any Notes issued in definitive form in exchange for a registered global note will be registered in
the name or names that the depositary gives to the trustee or other relevant agent of the trustee. It is expected that the depositary’s instructions will be based
upon directions received by the depositary from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the registered global note that had been held
by the depositary. In addition, we may at any time determine that the Notes of any series shall no longer be represented by a global note and will issue Notes
of such series in definitive form in exchange for such global note pursuant to the procedure described above.
