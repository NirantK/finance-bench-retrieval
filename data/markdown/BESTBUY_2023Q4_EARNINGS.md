“Today we are reporting Q4 sales that were in line with our expectations and profitability that was better than
expected,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “Throughout Q4 and FY23, we remained committed to balancing our
near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our
strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance.”

“We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be pressured in FY24 and we will continue to adjust,”
Barry added. “At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our industry and our future - there are more
technology products than ever in peoples’ homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and
technology innovation will continue. Our initiatives to deliver our omnichannel retail model evolution, build customer
relationships through membership, and remove cost and improve efficiency and effectiveness will allow us to
deliver even more experiences no one else can and capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.”

FY24 Financial Guidance

“As we enter FY24, the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of the broader macro
environment and its impact on consumers,” said Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO. “As a result, our outlook assumes
comparable sales decline 3% to 6% for the year, with the most sales pressure in the first quarter, as year-over-year
comparisons ease through the year.”

“During FY24, we expect to expand our gross profit rate approximately 40 to 70 basis points versus the past year
as we evolve our membership program and realize benefits from our cost optimization efforts,” Bilunas continued.
“Non-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to increase versus last year as our cost takeout initiatives and lower
variable costs are offset by the addback of incentive compensation, the extra week and higher depreciation.”

Best Buy is providing the following financial guidance for FY24, which includes 53 weeks.

  Revenue of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion
  Comparable sales decline of 3.0% to 6.0%
  Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate2 of 3.7% to 4.1%
  Non-GAAP effective income tax rate2 of approximately 24.5%
  Non-GAAP diluted EPS2 of $5.70 to $6.50
  Capital expenditures of approximately $850 million

Note: Incorporated in the above guidance, the 53rd week is expected to add approximately $700 million of revenue
to Q4 FY24 and provide a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to the company’s full year non-GAAP operating
income rate.2

Domestic Segment Q4 FY23 Results

Domestic Revenue
Domestic revenue of $13.53 billion decreased 9.8% versus last year primarily driven by a comparable sales decline
of 9.6%.

From a merchandising perspective, the largest drivers of the comparable sales decline on a weighted basis were
computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones. These drivers were partially offset by growth in the
gaming and tablet categories.

Domestic online revenue of $5.14 billion decreased 13.0% on a comparable basis, and as a percentage of total
Domestic revenue, online revenue was 38.0% versus 39.4% last year.

Domestic Gross Profit Rate
Domestic gross profit rate was 19.8% versus 20.0% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower
product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable services margin rates and higher profit-sharing
revenue from the company’s private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. The improved services margin
rates were primarily driven by an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from the company’s services plan
portfolio.

2

Domestic Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)
Domestic GAAP SG&A was $2.07 billion, or 15.3% of revenue, versus $2.30 billion, or 15.3% of revenue, last year.
On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A was $2.05 billion, or 15.1% of revenue, versus $2.27 billion, or 15.1% of revenue,
last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A decreased primarily due to reduced store payroll expense, incentive
compensation and advertising expenses.

International Segment Q4 FY23 Results

International Revenue
International revenue of $1.20 billion decreased 12.2% versus last year. This decrease was primarily driven by a
comparable sales decline of 5.7% and the negative impact of approximately 570 basis points from foreign currency
exchange rates.

International Gross Profit Rate
International gross profit rate was 21.7% versus 22.9% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily driven by
lower product margin rates, which included increased promotions, and a lower mix of revenue from the higher
margin rate services category.

International SG&A
International SG&A was $189 million, or 15.7% of revenue, versus $206 million, or 15.0% of revenue, last year.
SG&A decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and lower incentive compensation.

Restructuring Charges

The company incurred $86 million of restructuring costs in Q4 FY23, primarily related to employee termination
benefits associated with an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced in Q2 FY23 to better align its
spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as to optimize its cost structure. Consistent with prior
practice, restructuring costs are excluded from the company’s non-GAAP results.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

In Q4 FY23, the company returned a total of $743 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $549
million and dividends of $194 million. For the full year, the company returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders
through share repurchases of $1.0 billion and dividends of $789 million.

Today, the company announced its board of directors approved a 5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to
$0.92 per share. The regular quarterly dividend will be payable on April 13, 2023, to shareholders of record as of
the close of business on March 23, 2023.

Conference Call

Best Buy is scheduled to conduct an earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Central Time)
on March 2, 2023. A webcast of the call is expected to be available at www.investors.bestbuy.com, both live and
after the call.

Notes:
(1) The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of
calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on
comparable sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and available at
www.investors.bestbuy.com.

(2) A reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP operating income rate, non-GAAP effective income tax rate and non-
GAAP diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without
unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty
predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be
recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; price-fixing
settlements; goodwill impairments; gains and losses on investments; intangible asset amortization; certain
acquisition-related costs; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items
from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future
disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-
GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments,
such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently
unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements:
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 as contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. These statements reflect management’s current views and estimates regarding future market conditions,

"guidance," "intend," “may,” “might,” "outlook," "plan," “possible,” "project" “seek,” “should,” “would,” and other words
and terms of similar meaning or the negatives thereof. Such statements reflect our current views and estimates with
respect to future market conditions, company performance and financial results, operational investments, business
prospects, our operating model, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, consumer
behavior and other events. These statements involve a number of judgments and are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the Company, that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the potential results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Readers should review Item 1A,
Risk Factors, of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any updated information in subsequent
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for a description of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements made in this release. Among the factors that
could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking
statements are the following: macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate (including but not
limited to the effects of COVID-19, recession, inflation rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
limitations on a government’s ability to borrow and/or spend capital, fluctuations in housing prices, energy markets,
and jobless rates and effects related to the conflict in Ukraine or other geopolitical events); catastrophic events,
health crises and pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic); susceptibility of the products we sell to
technological advancements, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences; competition
(including from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce business, technology service providers, traditional store-based
retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers and in the provision of delivery speed and options); our ability to
attract and retain qualified employees; changes in market compensation rates; our expansion into health and new
products, services and technologies; our focus on services as a strategic priority; our reliance on key vendors and
mobile network carriers (including product availability); our ability to maintain positive brand perception and
recognition; our ability to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions; our ability to effectively
manage our real estate portfolio; inability of vendors or service providers to perform components our supply chain
(impacting our stores or other aspects of our operations) and other various functions of our business; risks arising
from and potentially unique to our exclusive brands products; our reliance on our information technology systems,
internet and telecommunications access and capabilities; our ability to prevent or effectively respond to a cyber-
attack, privacy or security breach; product safety and quality concerns; changes to labor or employment laws or
regulations; risks arising from statutory, regulatory and legal developments (including statutes and/or regulations
related to tax or privacy); evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations

4

(including, but not limited to, cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters); risks arising from
our international activities (including those related to the conflict in Ukraine or fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates) and those of our vendors; failure to effectively manage our costs; our dependence on cash flows
and net earnings generated during the fourth fiscal quarter; pricing investments and promotional activity; economic
or regulatory developments that might affect our ability to provide attractive promotional financing; constraints in the
capital markets; changes to our vendor credit terms; changes in our credit ratings; failure to meet financial-
performance guidance or other forward-looking statements; and general economic uncertainty in key global markets
and worsening of global economic conditions or low levels of economic growth. We caution that the foregoing list of
important factors is not complete. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that we may make.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
($ in millions, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited and subject to reclassification)

The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP financial measures) to presented non-GAAP financial measures.
The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can
provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For
these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, presented non-GAAP
financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, price-fixing settlements, goodwill impairments,
gains and losses on investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such
items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when the company believes this
provides greater clarity to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to,
and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s
financial statements and other publicly filed reports. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(1)  Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships,

tradenames and developed technology assets.

(2)  Represents charges associated with acquisition-related transaction and due diligence costs, primarily comprised of professional fees.
(3)  Represents charges primarily related to employee termination benefits in the Domestic segment associated with an enterprise-

wide initiative that commenced in Q2 FY23 to better align the company’s spending with critical strategies and operations, as well
as to optimize its cost structure, for the periods ended January 28, 2023. Represents charges and subsequent adjustments primarily related
to actions taken in the Domestic segment to better align the company’s organizational structure with its strategic focus and the exit from
operations in Mexico in the International segment for the periods ended January 29, 2022.

(4)  Represents inventory markdown adjustments recorded within cost of sales associated with the exit from operations in Mexico.
(5)  The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S., Canada and Mexico. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the

statutory tax rate of 24.5% for the U.S. and 26.4% for Canada applied to the non-GAAP adjustments of each country. There is no income
tax charge for Mexico non-GAAP items and a minimal amount of U.S. non-GAAP items, as there was no tax benefit recognized on these
expenses in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.

Return on Assets and Non-GAAP Return on Investment

The tables below provide calculations of return on assets ("ROA") (GAAP financial measure) and non-GAAP return on
investment (“ROI”) (non-GAAP financial measure) for the periods presented. The company believes ROA is the most directly
comparable financial measure to ROI. Non-GAAP ROI is defined as non-GAAP adjusted operating income after tax divided by
average invested operating assets. All periods presented below apply this methodology consistently. The company believes non-
GAAP ROI is a meaningful metric for investors to evaluate capital efficiency because it measures how key assets are deployed
by adjusting operating income and total assets for the items noted below. This method of determining non-GAAP ROI may differ
from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.

Income statement accounts represent the activity for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. Balance sheet
accounts represent the average account balances for the trailing 12 months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates.
(2)  Non-GAAP operating income adjustments include continuing operations adjustments for restructuring charges, intangible asset

amortization and acquisition-related transaction costs. Additional details regarding these adjustments are included in the Reconciliation of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures schedule in this earnings release.

(3)  Operating lease interest represents the add-back to operating income to approximate the total interest expense that the company would

incur if its operating leases were owned and financed by debt. The add-back is approximated by multiplying average operating lease assets
by 4%, which approximates the interest rate on the company’s operating lease liabilities.
Income taxes are approximated by using a blended statutory rate at the Enterprise level based on statutory rates from the countries in
which the company does business, which primarily consists of the U.S. with a statutory rate of 24.5% for the periods presented.

(4)

(5)  Operating lease amortization represents operating lease cost less operating lease interest. Operating lease cost includes short-term leases,

which are immaterial, and excludes variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease asset balance.

(6)  Excess cash represents the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments greater than $1 billion, which approximates the

amount of cash the company believes is necessary to run the business and may fluctuate over time.

(7)  Accumulated depreciation and amortization represents accumulated depreciation related to property and equipment and accumulated

amortization related to definite-lived intangible assets.

(8)  Adjusted current liabilities represent total current liabilities less short-term debt and the current portions of operating lease liabilities and

long-term debt.
