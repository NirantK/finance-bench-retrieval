FULL YEAR 2022 SEGMENT COMMENTARY:

Adjusted operational sales* reflected below excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and

translational currency.

Consumer Health

Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 3.9%* predominately driven by over-the-

counter (OTC) products.  Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, as well

as upper respiratory products and digestive health products in the international markets.  Additionally, Skin

Health/Beauty adjusted operational growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA outside the U.S. Growth was

partially offset by Oral Care in the international markets.

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical  worldwide  adjusted  operational  sales  grew  6.8%*,  driven  by  DARZALEX  (daratumumab),  a

biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, STELARA (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number

of  immune-mediated  inflammatory  diseases,  ERLEADA  (apalutamide),  a  next-generation  androgen  receptor

inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, TREMFYA (guselkumab), a biologic for the treatment

of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, and INVEGA

SUSTENNA/XEPLION  and  INVEGA  TRINZA/TREVICTA  (paliperidone  palmitate),  long-acting,  injectable

atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.  This growth was partially offset by declines

in  sales  of  REMICADE  (infliximab),  a  biologic  approved  for  the  treatment  of  several  immune-mediated

inflammatory diseases, IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain

B-cell malignancies, a type of blood or lymph node cancer, and ZYTIGA (abiratone acetate), an oral, once daily

medication for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate

cancer.

MedTech

MedTech worldwide  adjusted operational sales  grew 6.1%*, driven primarily by electrophysiology products in

Interventional Solutions, contact lenses in Vision, and wound closure products in General Surgery.

FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:

Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the company

is  unable  to  predict  with  reasonable  certainty  the  ultimate  outcome  of  legal  proceedings,  unusual  gains  and

losses,  acquisition-related  expenses  and  purchase  accounting  fair  value  adjustments  without  unreasonable

effort.  These  items  are  uncertain,  depend on  various  factors,  and could  be material  to  Johnson  &  Johnson's

results computed in accordance with GAAP.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:

* “Operational sales growth” excluding the impact of translational currency, “adjusted operational sales growth”

excluding  the  net  impact  of  acquisitions  and  divestitures  and  translational  currency,  as  well  as  “adjusted  net

earnings”, “adjusted diluted earnings per share” and “adjusted operational diluted earnings per share” excluding

after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures and should not

be  considered  replacements  for,  and  should  be  read  together  with,  the  most  comparable  GAAP  financial

measures. Except for guidance measures, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most

directly  comparable  GAAP  financial  measures  can  be  found  in  the  accompanying  financial  schedules  of  the

earnings release and the Investors section of the company's website at quarterly results.

Copies of the financial schedules accompanying this earnings release are available on the company’s website

earnings,  reconciliations  of  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  and  sales  of  key  products/franchises.  Additional

information on Johnson & Johnson, including adjusted income before tax by segment, a pharmaceutical pipeline

of selected compounds in late stage development and a copy of today’s earnings call presentation can also be

found in the Investors section of the company's website at quarterly results.

NOTE TO INVESTORS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act

of 1995 regarding, among other things: future operating and financial performance, product development, market

position and business strategy, and the anticipated separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business. The

reader  is  cautioned  not  to  rely  on  these  forward-looking  statements.  These  statements  are  based  on  current

expectations  of  future  events.  If  underlying  assumptions  prove  inaccurate  or  known  or  unknown  risks  or

uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson &

Johnson. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency

exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by

competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success

and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products; challenges

to patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans; the

impact of business combinations and divestitures; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply

chain;  product  efficacy  or  safety  concerns  resulting  in  product  recalls  or  regulatory  action;  significant  adverse

litigation  or  government  action,  including  related  to  product  liability  claims;  changes  to  applicable  laws  and

regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; changes

in  behavior  and  spending  patterns  of  purchasers  of  health  care  products  and  services;  financial  instability  of

international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by

government agencies; the Company’s ability to satisfy the necessary conditions to consummate the separation of

the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all; the Company’s ability to successfully separate

the  Company’s  Consumer  Health  business  and  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  separation;  the  New

Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company; and risks related to the

impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, such as the scope and duration of the outbreak, government actions and

restrictive measures implemented in response, material delays and cancellations of medical procedures, supply

chain disruptions and other impacts to the business, or on the company’s ability to execute business continuity

plans, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other

factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2,

2022, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A.

Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the

Notes:
Acquisition, integration and divestiture related for 2022 primarily includes costs related to the Abiomed acquisition.  Acquisition, integration and divestiture related for 2021
primarily includes the gain on the divestiture of two Pharmaceutical brands outside of the U.S.

European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) costs represent one-time compliance costs for the Company’s previously registered products. MDR is a replacement of the existing
European Medical Devices Directive regulatory framework, and manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May
2021. The Company considers the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant one-time regulatory change and is not indicative of on-going operations.  The Company has excluded
only external third-party regulatory and consulting costs from its MedTech operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing
performance which is expected to be completed during 2024.

COVID-19 Vaccine related costs include remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit costs and required clinical trial expenses,
associated with the Company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual
requirements.

4

The tax impact related to special item adjustments reflects the current and deferred income taxes associated with the above pre-tax special items in arriving at adjusted
earnings.
