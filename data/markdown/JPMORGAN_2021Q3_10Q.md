Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third
quarter of 2021 versus the third quarter of 2020, unless
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $11.7 billion for
the third quarter of 2021, or $3.74 per share, on net
revenue of $29.6 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 18%
and ROTCE of 22%. The Firm's results for the third quarter
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses of $2.1 billion and an income tax benefit of $566
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax
return. The tax benefit included state and local impacts of
federal tax method changes and a reduction in the valuation
allowance for U.S. foreign tax credits.

• Net income was $11.7 billion, up $2.2 billion.

• Total net revenue was up 1%.

– Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 2%, driven
by higher Investment Banking fees in CIB and asset
management fees in AWM, predominantly offset by net
investment securities losses in Corporate compared to
net gains in the prior year, and lower revenue in Home
Lending.

– Net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 1%, driven
by balance sheet growth and higher market rates,
predominantly offset by change in balance sheet mix
and lower net interest income in CIB Markets.

• Noninterest expense was $17.1 billion, up 1%, driven by

continued investments in the business, including
marketing and technology, and higher volume- and
revenue-related expense, predominantly offset by lower
legal expense and structural expense. Noninterest
expense for the prior year included an impairment on a
legacy investment.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.5
billion, reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for
credit losses of $2.1 billion, driven by improvements in
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and $524 million of
net charge-offs.

– The net reserve release in the current period consisted

of $1.2 billion in Wholesale and $874 million in
Consumer, driven by $850 million in Card.

– Net charge-offs of $524 million declined $656 million,

predominantly driven by Card.

The prior year provision was an expense of $611 million,
reflecting $1.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net
reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $569
million.

5

• The total allowance for credit losses was $20.5 billion at
September 30, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.86%,
compared with 2.02% in the second quarter of 2021,
and 3.26% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.9 billion at

September 30, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the
prior year, driven by:

– paydowns and upgrades in the wholesale portfolio,

across CB, CIB and AWM, and

– lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the consumer

portfolio due to sales in CIB.

Nonperforming assets were down $920 million from June
30, 2021, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the
wholesale and consumer portfolios, reflecting improved
credit performance and paydowns.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 5%

driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM, partially offset by
lower loans in CB and CCB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 19%,
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily
driven by the effect of certain government actions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities,
as well as the well-being of its employees.

The Firm continues to actively monitor the health and
safety situations at local and regional levels as more of the
Firm's global workforce returns to the office, and will adapt
its plans as these situations evolve.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
("FCA") confirmed that the publication of the principal
tenors of the U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate
("LIBOR") (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-
month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen,
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31,
2021. The Firm continues to prioritize those currencies and
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation and is finalizing its
operational readiness to support rate fallback mechanisms
across all products that reference IBORs for which
publication will cease on December 31, 2021.

The Firm continues to engage with clients to arrange for the
remediation of in-scope IBOR-linked contracts, and to
amend contracts with clients that are prepared to do so. For
example, substantially all of the notional amounts of the
Firm’s derivatives exposures that are documented under
bilateral agreements now contain IBOR fallback provisions
by virtue of counterparty adherence to the 2020
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.’s
("ISDA") IBOR Fallbacks Protocol. The Firm is also prepared
for the conversion to alternative reference rates at various
central counterparties ("CCPs") scheduled for the fourth
quarter of 2021.

The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have
encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that
use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31,
2021, and in connection with this, the Firm now offers
various floating rate products, and provides and arranges
various types of floating rate debt financings, that reference
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) across its
businesses.

The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the
tax implications of reference rate reform and the legislative
progress associated with contracts or instruments that do
not have satisfactory rate fallback mechanisms and that
cannot easily be amended (e.g., certain floating rate debt
securities, securitizations and adjustable rate mortgages).

(b)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB,
primarily reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and

wallet share gains, and

• higher equity underwriting fees due to wallet share gains

and increased activity in the IPO market.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:

• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets across

products, particularly in Commodities, Rates and Credit
compared to a strong prior year, including an adjustment
to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio; and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by strong
performance across prime brokerage, derivatives and
Cash equities.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34  and Note 5
for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased largely as a
result of higher cash management fees in CIB and CB.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and CB on
pages 35-38, and Note 5 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees
in AWM as a result of cumulative net inflows into long-term
products and higher average market levels, net of liquidity
fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher level of client
investment assets on higher average market levels and net
inflows.

Refer to AWM and CCB segment results on pages 39-43,
and pages 24-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information on asset management, administration and
commissions revenue.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio,
compared with net gains in the prior year from the sales of
U.S. GSE and government agency mortgage-backed
securities ("MBS"). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 44-46 and Note 9 for additional information on
investment securities gains/(losses).

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior
period, and

10

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting lower

partially offset by

production margins, partially offset by higher volumes.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, Note 5 and
14 for additional information.

Card income decreased reflecting the amortization of
higher account origination costs, including promotional
offers. Net interchange was relatively flat as the increase in
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an increase
to the rewards liability. Refer to CCB segment results on
pages 24-28, Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88,
and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income increased reflecting:

• higher gains on several investments, predominantly in

CIB, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to

derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and
CIO,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of

the decline in volume.

Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet
growth and higher market rates, primarily offset by change
in balance sheet mix and lower net interest income in CIB
Markets.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, up $345 billion, primarily driven by higher deposits
with banks, and the yield was 1.80%, down 25 basis points
(“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was
1.62%, a decrease of 20 bps. The net yield excluding CIB
Markets was 1.91%, down 14 bps.

Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB
Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates
schedule on page 183 for further details; and the
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a further
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB,
reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A activity and

wallet share gains

• higher equity underwriting fees due to increased activity

and wallet share gains in the IPO market, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by an active

leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition
financing.

Principal transactions revenue decreased driven by CIB,
reflecting:

• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in

Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Commodities
compared to a strong prior year, and an increase in
Securitized Products,

• higher revenue in Equity Markets driven by strong

performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and
Cash Equities,

• favorable results in Credit Adjustments & Other, with a
net gain of $338 million largely driven by valuation
adjustments related to derivatives, compared with a
$272 million net loss, in the prior year, predominantly
driven by losses on certain components of fair-value
option elected liabilities, as well as the impact of funding
spread widening on derivatives; and

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were
more than offset by the related net interest income earned
on these transactions.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a result of:

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees
in CIB,

predominantly offset by

• lower overdraft fees in CCB.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of

strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity
products and higher average market levels, net of
liquidity fee waivers; and in CCB related to the higher
level of client investment assets on higher average
market levels and net inflows, and

• higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services, primarily
associated with the higher level of assets under custody.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net losses
related to repositioning the investment securities portfolio,
compared with net gains in the prior year from the sales of
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:
• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher

production volumes.

Card income increased due to higher net interchange
income and merchant processing fees reflecting the
acceleration of debit and credit card sales volume above
pre-pandemic levels, and lower amortization costs related
to new account originations.
Other income increased reflecting:
• gains on several investments compared with losses in the
prior year, primarily in CIB, and higher gains in AWM, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in
Treasury and CIO, and derivatives in Other Corporate,

11

predominantly offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of

the decline in volume, and

• increased amortization on a higher level of alternative
energy investments in the tax-oriented investment
portfolio in CIB. The increased amortization was more
than offset by lower income tax expense from the
associated tax credits. Additionally, the first quarter of
2021 included weather-related write-downs on certain
renewable energy investments.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the
impact of lower market rates and change in balance sheet
mix, partially offset by balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, up $454 billion, predominantly driven by higher
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield
was 1.82%, down 65 bps. The net yield on these assets, on
an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease of 40 bps. The net
yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.92%, down 49 bps.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net
reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net
reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflected a net reduction of $1.2
billion in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly in
CIB and CB. The prior year included a $270 million net
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $874 million reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, in particular $850 million in Card reflecting
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card as consumer
cash balances remained elevated benefiting from the
residual impact of government stimulus and payment
assistance programs;

• the prior year included a $396 million reduction in the

allowance for credit losses.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, CIB on pages
29-34, CB on pages 35-38, AWM on pages 39-43, the
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76, and Notes 9
and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio
and the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in the allowance for credit

losses, including $6.2 billion in Card reflecting
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and
$1.2 billion in Home Lending primarily due to continued
improvements in Home Price Index ("HPI") expectations,
and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the impact of government stimulus and payment
assistance programs;

• the prior year included an $8.3 billion addition to the

allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflects a net reduction of $2.3
billion in the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook. The prior year included a $6.7 billion net addition
to the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results
The effective tax rate for the current period was 17.2%,
and reflected an income tax benefit of $566 million related
to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return. The tax
benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax
method changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance
for U.S. foreign tax credits.

The prior year effective tax rate was 19.8% and also
reflected an income tax benefit related to prior year
returns.

Both periods reflected the impact of the level and mix of
income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local
taxes.

Year-to-date results
The effective tax rate for the current period was 19.1%
and reflected an income tax benefit of $566 million related
to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return, largely
offset by the resolution of certain tax audits. The tax benefit
included state and local impacts of federal tax method
changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S.
foreign tax credits.

The prior year effective tax rate was 17.7% and included a
benefit related to prior year returns and the higher impact

income.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in
deposits and limited deployment opportunities in Treasury
and CIO. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements
of its excess cash with various central banks, including the
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and lower

client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in

CIB Markets.

Securities borrowed increased reflecting higher client-
driven activities, and an increase in the demand for
securities to cover short positions in CIB Markets.

Refer Note 10 for additional information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities
borrowed.

Trading assets increased reflecting;

• client-driven market-making activities in equity

instruments, predominantly in CIB prime brokerage,

partially offset by
• lower derivative receivables, primarily driven by

maturities of certain trades in CIB, and

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to purchases and
paydowns in held-to-maturity ("HTM") securities, partially
offset by paydowns and net purchases in available-for-sale
("AFS") securities. In the second quarter of 2021, AFS
securities of $104.5 billion were transferred to the HTM
portfolio for capital management purposes. Refer to
Corporate segment results on pages 44-46, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 77, and Notes 2 and 9
for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; and higher

securities-based lending, mortgages, as well as custom
lending in AWM,

partially offset by

• lower loans in CBB and CB primarily driven by the impact
of PPP forgiveness; and lower retained residential real
estate loans in Home Lending primarily due to net
paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses decreased, consisting of:

• a $7.9 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and in the residential real
estate portfolio, primarily due to continued
improvements in HPI expectations, and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook.

There was a $104 million net reduction in the allowance for
lending-related commitments, driven by both wholesale and
consumer. This allowance is included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheets. The total net reduction in

16

the allowance for credit losses was $10.3 billion, as of
September 30, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59-77, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities
primarily in CIB prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially offset

by the realization of expected cash flows; and

• an increase in Goodwill as a result of the acquisitions of

Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank and Campbell Global.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased due to the higher cash collateral
placed with central counterparties ("CCPs") in CIB, and
higher tax receivables. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities financing transactions.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the
effect of certain government actions in response to the
COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by
growth from existing and new accounts across both
consumer and small business customers. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 54-58 and Notes 2 and 15 for
additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• the impact of client activities and secured financing of

trading assets in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in

Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 and
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased predominantly as a result
of higher financing of prime brokerage activities in CIB.
Refer to pages 54-58 for information on changes in
Liquidity Risk Management.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables
largely as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2
and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting
higher client payables related to client-driven activities
primarily in CIB prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for
additional information on securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased
driven by maturities of credit card securitizations in
Treasury and CIO, as well as lower issuances of commercial
paper as a result of lower loan balances in the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits in CIB. Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 19 and Notes 13 and
22 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and
loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances, partially
offset by fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to
higher rates. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
54-58 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income,
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions, and a
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income
(“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of
higher rates on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow
hedges. Refer to page 94 for information on changes in
stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on pages 51-52, and
Note 19 for additional information on AOCI.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements
can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

Type of off-balance sheet arrangement

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on
pages 91-95.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE”
basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business
segments may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm
allocates interest income and expense to each business
segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and
liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate
risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements on a product-
by-product basis within each business segment.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 51, and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $769 million and $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively,

and $2.5 billion and $3.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Included MSR risk management results of $(145) million and $145 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and

$(363) million and $134 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.3 billion, up 12%, driven by a decrease
in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 3%.

Net interest income was $8.4 billion, up 4%, driven by:

• growth in deposits net of margin compression as well as

the impacts from PPP including the accelerated
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan
forgiveness in CBB, lower prepayments in Home Lending,
higher auto loans, and lower funding costs in Card,

partially offset by

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of higher
payments and lower cumulative sales volume throughout
2020.

Noninterest revenue was $4.1 billion, down 15%, driven
by:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a net

loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior
period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the

decline in volume,

• lower card income reflecting the amortization of higher
account origination costs, including promotional offers,
while net interchange was relatively flat as the increase in
debit and credit card sales volume was offset by an
increase to the rewards liability, and

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting the net

impact of lower production margins and higher volumes,

24

partially offset by

• higher asset management fees related to the higher level
of client investment assets on higher average market
levels and net inflows.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88, and Note 5 for
additional information on card income.

Noninterest revenue was $13.5 billion, up 2%, driven by:

• higher card income due to higher net interchange income
reflecting the acceleration of debit and credit card sales
volume in 2021, above pre-pandemic levels, and lower
amortization costs related to new account originations,

• higher asset management fees related to the higher level
of client investment assets on higher average market
levels and net inflows, and

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 5%, driven by:

production volumes,

• continued investments in the business, including

offset by

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue as a result of a net
loss in MSR risk management results driven by updates to
model inputs, compared with a net gain in the prior
period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the

decline in volume, and

• lower overdraft fees.

Noninterest expense was $21.5 billion, up 3%, reflecting:

• continued investments in the business, including

marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the businesses,

including performance-related compensation,

largely offset by

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the

impact of higher vehicle collateral values

• lower structural expenses.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $5.9
billion, compared with an expense of $12.4 billion in the
prior year, driven by:

• an $8.2 billion reduction in the allowance for credit

losses, driven by improvements in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, consisting of $6.2 billion in
Card, $1.2 billion in Home Lending, primarily due to
continued improvements in HPI expectations, $575
million in CBB and $225 million in Auto, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the impact of government stimulus and payment
assistance programs.

The prior year included an $8.7 billion addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the businesses,

including performance-related compensation,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and the

impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $459
million, compared with an expense of $795 million in the
prior year, driven by:

• a $950 million reduction in the allowance for credit

losses, reflecting improvements in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook consisting of $850 million in
Card and $100 million in CBB, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as

consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the residual impact of government stimulus and
payment assistance programs.

The prior year included a $300 million reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $16.7 billion, up $12.8 billion, driven by a
decrease in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $37.8 billion, a decrease of 2%.

Net interest income was $24.3 billion, down 4%, driven by:

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of higher
payments and lower cumulative sales volume throughout
2020 and the net impact of deposit margin compression
and growth in CBB,

largely offset by

• lower funding costs in Card related to changes in portfolio
mix and the impacts from PPP including the accelerated
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan
forgiveness in CBB.

on pages 61-65 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(d) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, included $11.1 billion and $20.3 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 60 for a further
discussion of the PPP.

(e) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.6 billion, up 29% and includes a net
benefit in the provision for credit losses.
Net revenue was $12.4 billion, up 7%.
Banking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 30%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, up 45%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 52%,
reflecting higher advisory and equity underwriting fees.
– Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, up 187%, driven by

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 41%,
driven by wallet share gains and increased activity in
the IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 3%,

driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily
related to acquisition financing.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.6 billion, up 22%,
and included gains on equity investments. Excluding
these gains, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 10%, driven by
higher deposit balances and fees, partially offset by
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $244 million, down 27%, driven by

lower net interest income.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.5 billion,
down 4%. Markets revenue was $6.3 billion, down 5%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.7 billion, down

20%, driven by lower revenue in Commodities, Rates and
Spread products compared to a strong prior year,
including an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the
derivatives portfolio.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.6 billion, up 30%, driven

by strong performance across prime brokerage,
derivatives, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 9%,

driven by growth in fees and deposit balances.

Noninterest expense was $5.9 billion, relatively flat  to the
prior year, as higher structural expense, volume- and
revenue- related expense and investments in the business,
including technology and front office hires, were offset by
lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $638
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with a net benefit of $81 million in the
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $16.3 billion, up 39%, primarily reflecting
the absence of an increase in the provision for credit losses
in the prior year.
Net revenue was $40.2 billion, up 6%.
Banking revenue was $14.5 billion, up 27%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $9.3 billion, up 46%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 42%,
reflecting higher fees across products. The Firm ranked
#1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to
Dealogic.
– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, up 84%, driven by

increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $3.2 billion, up 54%,
driven by increased activity and wallet share gains in
the IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $3.9 billion, up 16%,
predominantly driven by an active leveraged loan
market primarily related to acquisition financing.
• Wholesale Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, up 8%
and included gains on equity investments. Excluding
these gains, revenue was $4.3 billion, up 4%, driven by
higher deposit balances and fees, largely offset by
deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $738 million, down 23%, driven by
lower net interest income, partially offset by higher loan
commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.7 billion,
down 3%. Markets revenue was $22.1 billion, down 6%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $13.5 billion, down
20%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies &
Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and
Commodities compared to a strong prior year, partially
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $8.6 billion, up 30%, driven

by strong performance across derivatives, prime
brokerage, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%, with

growth in deposits and fees, predominantly offset by
deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $338 million

largely driven by valuation adjustments related to
derivatives. The prior year loss of $272 million was
predominantly driven by losses on certain components of
fair value option elected liabilities, as well as the impact
of funding spread widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $19.5 billion, up 5%,
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, largely performance-related
compensation, as well as higher structural expense,
partially offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $1.0
billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $3.3 billion in the
prior year.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets
revenue on page 74 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.4 billion, up 30%, largely driven by a
decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $4.0 billion, up $3.5 billion, predominantly
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.5 billion, up 10%. Net interest income
was $1.5 billion, up 1%, driven by the impact of lower
funding costs on loans and higher deposit balances, largely
offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue
was $988 million, up 30%, driven by higher investment
banking revenue and wholesale payments revenue.

Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, up 7%,
predominantly driven by higher investments in the business
and higher volume- and revenue- related expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $363
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with a net benefit of $147 million in the
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Net revenue was $7.4 billion, up 8%. Net interest income
was $4.5 billion, down 3%, driven by deposit margin
compression, offset by the impact of lower funding costs on
loans and higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was
$2.9 billion, up 30%, predominantly driven by higher
investment banking revenue and wholesale payments
revenue.

Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, up 5%, driven by
higher investments in the business and higher volume- and
revenue-related expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $858
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $3.3 billion in the
prior year.

(a) In the first quarter of 2021, the Wealth Management business was renamed Global Private Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2020, certain wealth

management clients were transferred from AWM Global Private Bank to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management unit in CCB’s Consumer & Business Banking
business. For further information see page 80 of the 2020 Form 10-K.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 36%.

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up 21%. Net interest income
was $988 million, up 21%. Noninterest revenue was $3.3
billion, up 21%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3 billion, up 21%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on cumulative net inflows

into long-term products and higher average market
levels, net of liquidity fee waivers; and higher
performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.0 billion, up
20%, predominantly driven by:
• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset

management fees, as well as the impact of lower funding
costs on loans, partially offset by deposit margin
compression.

Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 13%
predominantly driven by higher performance-related
compensation, distribution fees, and structural expense.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-76 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $3.6 billion, an increase of 63%.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, an increase of 20%. Net
interest income was $2.9 billion, up 13%. Noninterest
revenue was $9.6 billion, up 23%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $6.8 billion, up 24%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net
inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher
average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers; and
higher net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.7 billion, up
16%, predominantly driven by:

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset

management fees, as well as the impact of lower funding
costs on loans, partially offset by deposit margin
compression.

Noninterest expense was $7.9 billion, an increase of 10%,
predominantly driven by performance-related
compensation and distribution fees.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $191
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $265 million in the
prior year.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.
Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source for the peer group
quartile rankings of its funds from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled
funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor” funds, for which the source
remains Lipper) and Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund
performance utilizing this peer group ranking and believes that it provides
investors with comparability across the industry. This change resulted in
positive impacts on the quartile rankings shown in the following table, and
both positive and negative impacts on the quartile rankings for prior periods,
as compared to how they would have been ranked by Lipper. In addition,
AWM has changed its selection of the “primary share class” for certain non-
U.S. funds, as set forth below, in order to establish a more consistent
approach across these products. Prior periods in the following table have
been revised to conform to the current presentation.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4-

or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-
star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-
star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-
wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five-
and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not
rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are
sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the
fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the
star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides
ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if
all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked

in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile
rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S.
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds,
at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,
Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other
funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes
had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc
share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and risk management employees were transferred from Corporate to CIB.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $817 million compared with a net loss of $699
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957 million,
driven by:

• limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth

continued,

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments,

compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to

derivatives in Other Corporate and the early termination
of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and
CIO

Noninterest expense of $160 million was down $559
million primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on
a legacy investment in the prior year and lower structural
expense.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly
driven by an income tax benefit of $383 million related to
finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return and the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $2.6 billion compared with a net loss of $1.4
billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $2.9 billion, compared with a loss
of $927 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower
net interest income on limited deployment opportunities as
deposit growth continued.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net investment securities losses related to repositioning
the investment securities portfolio, compared with net
gains in the prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS,

predominantly offset by

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash
deployment transactions in the prior year, which were

44

more than offset by the related net interest income
earned on these transactions, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to the early
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in
Treasury and CIO and derivatives in Other Corporate

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion was up $539 million
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's
Foundation and higher legal and technology expense,
partially offset by the absence of an impairment on a legacy
investment in the prior year.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, the impact of the
Firm's estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the
level of year-to-date pretax income, as well as an income
tax benefit of $383 million related to finalizing the Firm's
2020 U.S. federal tax return.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects
the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

47

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and
stress testing.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
minimum capital ratios.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to
SLR on page 51 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a

three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022
(“CECL capital transition provisions”).

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended
September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm
exclude $3.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact
to retained earnings and 25% of the $1.9 billion increase
in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting
guidance.

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29,
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated
under the program. The Firm does not expect to realize
material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. As of September 30, 2021, the
Firm had approximately $13 billion of loans remaining
under the program.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them
under the final rule.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021
and did not have a material impact on the Firm’s risk-based
capital metrics.

Common stock dividends
On September 21, 2021, the Firm announced that its Board
of Directors had declared a quarterly common stock
dividend, which increased to $1.00 per share from $0.90
per share, effective with the dividend payable on October
31, 2021. The Firm’s dividends are subject to approval by
the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Common stock
On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021.
Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal
Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends
in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and
could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters.
On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the
temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire
on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the
2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR")
stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject

51

to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided
under the regulatory capital framework. The Firm continues
to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its
existing common share repurchase program previously
approved by the Board of Directors.

Refer to capital planning and stress testing on page 52 for
additional information.

Other capital requirements

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk
Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the three-
month period ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an

increase in cash from long-term debt issuances during the
second quarter 2021.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months
ended September 30, 2021, compared with the prior year
period primarily due to the relative impact on net cash
outflows from the significant increase in deposits.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during
the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared
with both the three month periods ended June 30, 2021
and September 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in
deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the third quarter
primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in
excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded
from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible
HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable
securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm
believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes
excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair
value of these securities was approximately $878 billion
and $740 billion as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased
compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in
excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which
was primarily a result of higher deposits as well as an
increase in CIB trading assets.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $303
billion and $307 billion as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively. This borrowing capacity
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and other central banks. Although available, the
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks
as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year
horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies

54

issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100%
on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule became effective
on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually
beginning in 2023.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. are compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,
based on the Firm's current understanding of the final rule.

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity
risk characteristics.

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of September 30, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, and the average deposit balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the
loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of
total liabilities, as of September 30, 2021 and

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of
market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting significant
inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of
certain government actions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth
from existing and new accounts across both consumer and
small business customers.

Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale
commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at
September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to
lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity
management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at
September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020, and for
the average three and nine months ended September 30,
2021 compared to the prior year period, was primarily due
to net issuances of structured notes and higher overdrafts
in CIB Markets.

MMLF.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased
at September 30, 2021, compared with December 31,
2020, reflecting the impact of client activities and secured
financing of trading assets in CIB Markets, partially offset by
lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in
Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

56

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance
and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven loan securitizations.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 19, and
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs,
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of September 30, 2021,
were as follows:

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 61-76 for a further
discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 77 for a further discussion of Investment
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk
Management on pages 110–134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit and
Investment Risk Management framework.

credit exposures. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform
with the current presentation.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current

presentation.

(d) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming

assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $644 million and $874 million,
respectively, and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S.
government agencies of $5 million and $9 million, respectively. These
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans
from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory
guidance.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan
modifications have not been considered troubled debt
restructurings (“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for
those customers and clients who would have otherwise
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 and Wholesale
Credit Portfolio on pages 66-74 for information on loan
modifications as of September 30, 2021. Refer to Notes 12
and 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan
modifications and the allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program
At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm
had approximately $13 billion and $27 billion, respectively,
of PPP loans remaining, including $11 billion and $19
billion, respectively, in the consumer portfolio, and $2
billion and $8 billion, respectively, in the wholesale
portfolio. Since inception of the Program, the Firm funded
approximately $40 billion of loans. The PPP ended on May
31, 2021 for new applications.

The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and
through September 30, 2021, approximately $27 billion of
loans were forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated
recognition in interest income of the associated deferred
processing fees, primarily in CCB.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28 and Credit
Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-
K for a further discussion on the PPP.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans
retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and
certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following
tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at
fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2
and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer
to Notes 11, 22, and 4 for additional information on the
Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative
receivables.

Refer to Note 9 for information regarding the credit risk
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and
refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 and Note 11 for
further discussions of the consumer credit environment and
consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime
segment of the consumer credit market. The macroeconomic environment continued to improve in 2021, with the credit
performance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefiting from government stimulus programs, payment
deferral programs and increasing home prices. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
114-120 and Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s
nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form
10-K for further information on lending-related commitments.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate.
(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, excluded operating lease assets of $18.3 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. These operating lease

assets are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $11.1 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The

Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 60 for a
further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and

auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(j) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government

agencies of $644 million and $874 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.
(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited

COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of
exit.

(l) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $35.2 billion and $16.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and

2020, respectively, and were $27.9 billion and $18.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts were
excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

61

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. During the
third quarter of 2021, there were approximately $390
million of new enrollments in consumer payment deferral
programs.
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $3.7
billion of retained consumer loans under payment deferral
programs, a decrease of approximately $24.6 billion from
June 30, 2020. The loans under deferral were predominantly
in residential real estate.  Predominantly all borrowers that
exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

Of the $3.7 billion of retained loans still under payment
deferral programs as of September 30, 2021, approximately
$1.6 billion were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment
deferral and approximately $100 million were accounted for
as TDRs because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not
elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance
provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act. Borrowers that are unable to resume or
continue making payments in accordance with the original or
modified contractual terms of their agreements upon exit
from deferral programs will be placed on nonaccrual status
in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit
cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and the loans
charged off or down in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off
policies. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form
10-K for additional information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and
charge-off policies.

62

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2020 driven by higher
residential real estate loans at fair value, partially offset by
lower retained residential real estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans declined from December 31, 2020 due to
paydowns outpacing originations of prime mortgage loans
in Home Lending, largely offset by growth in AWM. Retained
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2020
reflecting improved credit performance. The three and nine
month periods ending September 30, 2021 reflected net
recoveries benefiting from further improvement in HPI and
higher reversals of prior write-downs due to loan
prepayments as a result of the low rate environment
compared to net charge-offs for the three months ended
September 30, 2020, and lower net recoveries for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020.  In addition, the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 included a recovery on
a loan sale.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2020,
reflecting loan purchase activity in CIB driven by higher
client demand, as well as increased originations in Home
Lending due to the continued low rate environment.
Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December
31, 2020 due to sales in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $19.8 billion at September 30, 2021. This
amount included $6.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $6.4 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans
were $27.8 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. Net recoveries and charge-offs for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021,
respectively, were not material, as the credit performance
of this portfolio is generally in line with the performance of
the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

modifications that are not considered concessions and,
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer

three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and

(i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such
loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie
Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan
pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to
foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information about sales of
loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.

(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans

included $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers
were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for additional information about loans modified in a
TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

63

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio was relatively flat when
compared with December 31, 2020 due to growth in the
scored auto portfolio predominantly offset by a decrease in
business banking loans. The increase in the scored auto
portfolio was predominantly driven by loan originations
largely offset by paydowns. Business Banking loans declined
due to PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns largely offset by
loan originations. Net charge offs for the three months
ended September 30, 2021 increased when compared to
the same period in the prior year primarily due to
overdrafts. Net charge offs for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 decreased when compared to the
same period in the prior year primarily due to lower auto
charge-offs as the current year had a greater benefit from
government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and
higher vehicle collateral values. The scored auto portfolio
net charge-off rates were 0.03% and 0.04% for the three
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, and 0.01% and 0.28% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at

64

Credit card
Total credit card loans were relatively flat from
December 31, 2020 reflecting higher payments, offset by
strong sales volume in the second and third quarters of
2021. The September 30, 2021 30+ and 90+ day
delinquency rates of 1.00% and 0.49%, respectively,
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%,
respectively. The delinquency rates continue to be
positively impacted by government stimulus and support
provided to borrowers who participated in payment
assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021
compared with the  prior year periods reflecting lower
charge-offs and higher recoveries as consumer cash
balances remained elevated benefiting from the impact of
government stimulus and payment assistance programs.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At September 30, 2021, the Firm had $1.1 billion of credit
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs,
which does not include loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs,
compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification
programs to borrowers.

65

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 68-71 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the credit
environment continued to improve following the broad-
based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of September 30, 2021, retained loans increased $17.8
billion driven by CIB and AWM partially offset by decreases
in CB and CCB. In CB, the decrease was largely driven by a
net decrease in PPP loans. Lending-related commitments
increased $49.4 billion, predominantly driven by net
portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held
for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the
investment-grade percentage of the credit portfolio
decreased from 71% to 70% driven by net portfolio
activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure
was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020. Nonperforming exposure decreased
$814 million driven by lower nonperforming loans, largely
in Oil & Gas and Individuals and Individual Entities, with net
portfolio activity and select upgrades being partially offset
by select downgrades. The decrease in nonperforming loans
was partially offset by an increase in nonperforming
derivatives. Net charge-offs were $100 million.

(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans

to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM; these are reported within
accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold
through credit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage
both performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer
to Credit derivatives on page 74 and Note 4 for additional information.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current

presentation.

(d) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit
risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021,
predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the form
of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $177 million of retained loans under payment deferral, which decreased
from $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans. The
Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment deferrals
and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant or they
qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by
the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit
risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of September 30,
2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/
Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal
risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk
ratings.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on
which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit
portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the
retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative
contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market
conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and  December 31, 2020, representing approximately 3.8% and 4.0%
of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively, as select downgrades were offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity.
The total criticized exposure at September 30, 2021 was largely undrawn and $38.5 billion was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas exposure was $46.2 billion as of September 30, 2021, including $27.2 billion of Exploration & Production and Oil
field Services as shown in the table below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the investment-grade
percentage decreased from 47% to 41%, predominantly driven by increased noninvestment-grade derivative receivables
resulting from market movements related to Oil & Gas prices. However, criticized exposure decreased by $2.4 billion from
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.3 billion at September 30, 2021, driven by net portfolio activity and select upgrades
partially offset by select downgrades.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual
loan portfolio for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 and 2020. Since September 30, 2020, nonaccrual
loan exposure decreased $1.7 billion, largely in Oil & Gas
and Individuals and Individual Entities, with net portfolio
activity and select upgrades being partially offset by select
downgrades.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily
— was approximately 88% at both September 30, 2021,
and December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.
Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $67.9 billion and $75.4
billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively, with decreases primarily driven by maturities
of certain trades in CIB. Derivative receivables represent the
fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to
legally enforceable master netting agreements and the
related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that the Firm believes is legally enforceable and
may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the
definition of liquid securities is consistent with the
definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR
rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current
credit risk should also take into consideration other
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but
that the Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains
credit protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related
notes. Information on credit portfolio management
activities is provided in the table below.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020
Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies
and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for
credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and
investment securities.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on
pages 86-88 for further information on the allowance for
credit losses and related management judgments.

Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65,

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is
reflected within Investment Securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021
was $20.5 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for
credit losses reflected:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook.

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic
variables (“MEVs”) used in the Firm's allowance estimate
which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit
loss estimates, increased the reliance on management
judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately
address the economic circumstances. These adjustments
continued through the third quarter of 2021, although to a
lesser extent than experienced during 2020.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on
certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm
retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in
the third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of
2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate.
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly
invested in high-quality securities. At September 30, 2021,
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of
allowance for credit losses, was $593.0 billion, and the
average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 44-46 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 78-82 for
further information on the market risk inherent in the
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
54-58 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership
interests or other forms of junior capital and span multiple
asset classes. These investments are made by dedicated
investing businesses or as part of a broader business
strategy. In general, principal investments include tax-
oriented investments and investments made to enhance or
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those
that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. The
Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in line with its
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 85.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2021 when compared with
June 30, 2021. This was due to volatility rolling out of the
one-year historical look-back period impacting exposures in
commodities, as well as risk reductions in equities.

Year over year results
Average total VaR decreased by $54 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the
same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic rolling out of the one-year historical look-back
period, predominantly impacting exposures in fixed income
and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. As noted previously, average total VaR
decreased by $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year.
Daily Risk Management VaR has returned to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in late March of 2020 at the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of the 259 days, and observed eight
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of the
66 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended September 30, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point
intervals. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the
chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income

reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-
term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s
balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of
September 30, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never
experienced an interest rate environment where the
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. In a
negative interest rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario

by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities but also from the
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,
the time since origination, and other factors which are
updated periodically based on historical experience.
Deposit forecasts do not currently include assumptions to
account for the reversal of Quantitative Easing in the 12-
month horizon for earnings-at-risk.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

81

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to
the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as the movement in market
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries.

Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021 and
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased
cash placements with the central bank of Australia in the
first quarter of 2021, predominantly driven by client
activity following policy decisions in the country and growth
in client deposits.

Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues
to leverage use of remote access and video conferencing
solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote
work. As a result, the Firm has deployed additional
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud has normalized since the
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to employ various
controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as
providing employee and client education and awareness
trainings.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems;
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position,
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk,
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism
and health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees
and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide
resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover
its critical business functions and supporting assets (e.g.,
people, technology, data and facilities) in the event of a
business interruption. The program includes governance,
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as
well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess,
and manage business interruption and public safety risks.
The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency
program has played an integral role in maintaining the
Firm’s business operations during and after various events.

84

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions.
The estimation methods are of varying levels of
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,
and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the
current and forecasted environment is significantly
different from the historical macroeconomic environments
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than
in typical periods.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on
pages 86-88 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

85

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-76 and
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market
and weak overall economic conditions that affected
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale
lending portfolios.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on
certain sectors. Judgment is still required to estimate the
speed and trajectory of the economic recovery.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging
approximately 2.3% higher over the eight-quarter forecast,
with a peak difference of approximately 3.7% in the first
quarter of 2022; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower
recovery, remaining nearly 2.7% lower at the end of the

86

eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 5.9% in the first quarter of 2022; and lower
national HPI with a peak difference of nearly 14.4% and
forecasted trough, both in the first quarter of 2023.

consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2021.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including,
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for
further information.

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $6.8 billion
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including:

• the Firm continues to place meaningful weighting on its
adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit
losses as of September 30, 2021, and accordingly, the
existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond
those estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in

the Firm's allowance estimate, which has created
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimations

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, effects of government support and customer
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2021, the
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without
considering the additional weight the Firm has placed on its
adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated
effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures, the
comparison between these two scenarios reflects the
following differences:

• An increase of approximately $350 million for residential

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.6 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $2.1 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on
page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant valuation judgments
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
September 30, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $9.4 billion and $7.7
billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards
points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers
outpacing redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser
extent adjustments to redemption rate assumptions. Refer
to page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities,
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 154-155 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021

Standard

Summary of guidance

Effects on financial statements

• Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January

7, 2021 update was effective when issued.

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical
expedients related to contract modifications and
hedge accounting relationships, and discounting
transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020.
The discounting transition election was applied
retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical
expedients is to ease the administrative burden of
accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate
reform. These elections did not have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and
updated
January 2021

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to
current accounting guidance when financial
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and
other transactions are amended due to reference
rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain

contract amendments related to reference rate
reform as modifications rather than
extinguishments without the requirement to
assess the significance of the amendments.

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge
accounting relationship without automatic
termination of that relationship. Provides various
practical expedients and elections designed to
allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted
during the transition period.

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities
out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain
criteria are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to
account for derivatives modified to change the
rate used for discounting, margining, or contract
price alignment (collectively “discounting
transition”) as modifications.

Refer to the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms on pages 185-193 for definitions of terms and acronyms used throughout the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments
have been included such that this interim financial
information is fairly stated.

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation,
including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the
first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred
investment tax credits from accounts payable and other
liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying
value of the associated tax-oriented investments. The
reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax
expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with
no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation, including
the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did
not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed
basis.

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when
the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information
on offsetting assets and liabilities.

Income tax expense
The Firm’s effective tax rate was 17.2% and 19.1% for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021,
respectively, and 19.8% and 17.7% for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 reflects the recognition of an income
tax benefit of $566 million related to finalizing the Firm’s
2020 U.S. federal tax return, which reduced the Firm’s
effective tax rate by 4.0% and 1.2% respectively. The tax
benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax
method changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance
for U.S. foreign tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information.

96

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets,
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

97

The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of September 30, 2021, and December 31,

(a) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $68.6 billion and $117.6 billion, respectively, which were

mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

99

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge
funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $813 million and $670 million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30,
2021, and December 31, 2020, were trading assets of $56 million and $52 million, respectively, and other assets of $757 million and $618 million,
respectively.

(e) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included $27.2 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $8.1

billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with
the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $13.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of
such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable
components (that is, components that are actively quoted
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs
are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that
the input is being used to value.

In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $299 million, nonagency securities of $24 million and non-trading loans of $838 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $19 million, trading loans of $41 million and non-trading loans of $420 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $941 million and non-trading loans of $813 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $1.0 billion including $379 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

101

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of
the underlying instruments and external market factors that
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s
positions.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in
fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. When a
determination is made to classify a financial instrument
within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table
below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2
risk management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to
such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2020, for those items measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 109
for further information on changes impacting items
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2021
Level 3 assets were $17.1 billion at September 30, 2021,
reflecting an increase of $1.2 billion from June 30, 2021
and an increase of $697 million from December 31, 2020.

The increase for the three months ended September 30,
2021 was largely driven by an $802 million increase in
MSRs.

The increase for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 was predominantly driven by:

• a $2.1 billion increase in MSRs.

    partially offset by

• $444 million decrease in gross interest rate derivative

receivables due to settlements net of gains and
$443 million decrease in gross equity derivative
receivables due to settlements and transfers net of gains.

Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair
value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended September 30, 2021, there
were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, significant
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:

• $882 million of total debt and equity instruments, largely

trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability.

• $937 million of gross equity derivative receivables and
$704 million of gross equity derivative payables as a
result of a decrease in observability and an increase in
the significance of unobservable inputs.

• $1.0 billion of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in

observability.

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, there
were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2021,
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the
following:

• $1.1 billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely
trading loans, driven by an increase in observability.

107

• $1.7 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and

$1.6 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

• $673 million of non-trading loans, driven by an increase

in observability.

• $736 million of long-term debt driven, by an increase in

observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs for certain structured notes.

For the three months ended September 30, 2020, there
were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the
following:

• $2.2 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and

$2.7 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

• $2.3 billion of non-trading loans, driven by a decrease in

observability.

• $1.1 billion of long-term debt, driven by a decrease in
observability and an increase in the significance of
unobservable inputs for certain structured notes.

For the three months ended September 30, 2020,
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the
following:

• $965 million of gross equity derivative payables as a

result of an increase in observability and a decrease in
the significance of unobservable inputs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the
following:

• $1.7 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and

$1.9 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

• $1.1 billion of long-term debt driven by an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs for certain structured notes.

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/
or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in
which they occur.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives
The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods
indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s
risk management activities where the financial instruments
are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value
measurements rollforward tables on pages 102-108 for
further information on these instruments.

Three months ended September 30, 2021

• $1.3 billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net

interest rate derivative receivables and net equity
derivative receivables due to market movements.

• $928 million of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by

gains in short-term borrowings due to market
movements.

Three months ended September 30, 2020

• $744 million of net losses on assets, driven by market

movements in net equity derivative receivables.

• $763 million of net losses on liabilities, driven by market

movements in long-term debt.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2021

• $1.0 billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net

interest rate derivative receivables due to market
movements, partially offset by losses in net commodity
derivative receivables due to market movements.

• $988 million of net gains on liabilities, driven by gains in

short-term borrowings due to market movements.

         Nine months ended September 30, 2020

• $374 million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net

interest rate derivative receivables due to market
movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster
prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for
additional information on MSRs.

• $845 million of net gains on liabilities, predominantly

driven by market movements in long-term debt.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.2 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2021, $1.1 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $314 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2021, $208 million related to residential real
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 12% to 45% with a weighted average of 25%.

Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in
other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of
September 30, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2020 was $2.4 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward

and downward carrying value changes.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2021 were $826 million.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2021 were $(335) million.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a
nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa
Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6228 at September 30, 2021, and may be adjusted by Visa depending
on developments related to the litigation matters.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life.  The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as
follows for the periods indicated.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without
notice. Refer to page 173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets,
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise

be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued as part
of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are
carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss
information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related
risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI,
while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in
principal transactions revenue were $(6) million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively and $(8) million
and $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

financial instruments recorded in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $16.9 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(2) million and
$(39) million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.

The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited
number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as
derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or
for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and

payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained,
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are
shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown

separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of

the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

counterparty.

(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $68.8 billion and $88.0 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,

respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $61.2 billion and $78.4 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade),
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS

securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net

interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate
swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $19.3 billion and $11.5 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to
which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income
in future periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS
securities is $12.6 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $11.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

(e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive
(negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and
the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated
statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2021 and 2020.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $812 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at
September 30, 2021, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is
approximately eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign

exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.

(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. The amount reclassified for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 was not material. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm reclassified pre-tax losses of $8 million to
other income related to the liquidation of certain legal entities and the amount was not material for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Refer
to Note 19 for further information.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans
and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees
and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic
hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on

protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than
the notional amount of protection sold.

(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of

protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on

the identical reference instrument.

(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives
as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is
based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the
reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where
JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 9 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management
activities. At September 30, 2021, the investment
securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an
average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings).

During the second quarter of 2021, the Firm transferred
$104.5 billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for
capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax
unrealized gains of $425 million on the securities at the
date of transfer.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding the investment securities
portfolio.

The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.

$86.3 billion, at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac each exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity; the amortized cost and fair value of such securities were $69.5
billion and $71.1 billion, and $46.3 billion and $46.3 billion, respectively.

(b) The Firm purchased $15.9 billion and $79.0 billion of HTM securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and $514

million and $5.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

(c) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $73 million and $78 million at September 30, 2021 and

December 31, 2020, respectively.

(d) Excludes $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion of accrued interest receivables at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Firm did not

reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at September 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $1.3 billion and $150 million, at September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than
changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

HTM securities – credit risk
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the
risk rating assigned to each security. At both September 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020, all HTM securities were
rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 98% rated at least AA+.

Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was
$73 million and $120 million as of September 30, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM
securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been
elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities
financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. When the
Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect
to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are
met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the
balances outstanding under its securities financing
agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its
counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the

counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net
Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to
the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral,
along with securities financing balances that do not meet all
these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is
presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on
the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other
assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $10.6 billion and $17.0 billion,
respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $49.0 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $22.6 billion and

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Firm held $484 million and $598 million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are
recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings
on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following
categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding
credit card
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)

Credit card

Wholesale(c)(d)

• Credit card loans

• Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the

wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral,

purpose, and type of borrower.

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
more information on SPEs.

The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools
as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
2020. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $7.3 billion and $3.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $19.3

billion and $10.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the
correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related
commitments (including adjustments to record loans and
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of
cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was
$31 million and $225 million, respectively, of which
$30 million and $211 million, respectively, related to
loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-
related commitments for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020 was $113 million and $(75) million,
respectively, of which $24 million and $(76) million,
respectively, related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans
may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the
allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Loan modifications
The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan
modifications have not been considered TDRs because:

•

•

they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory
guidance, or

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided
by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of
the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not
place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on
nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise
reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for
credit losses.

Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

138

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans,
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may
result in negative amortization.

consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $41 million and

$36 million; 30–149 days past due included $11 million and $16 million; and 150 or more days past due included $20 million and $24 million at
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $31
million and $40 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Approximately 36% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports,
in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower
(“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7
residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-

dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying
collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $41 million and $39 million and $127 million and $119 million for the three and nine

months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited

COVID-19 payment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of
exit.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a

minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent
available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien
positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2021.
(k) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $72 million and $76 million, respectively.

These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

141

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm
grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply
the option to suspend the application of accounting
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The
carrying value of new TDRs was $116 million and $199
million for the three months ended September 30, 2021
and 2020, respectively, and $674 million and $537 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend
to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been
modified in TDRs.

Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various concessions to financially
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise
have been required under the terms of the original
agreement. The following table provides information about
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs
under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions, and
loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to
suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as
provided by the CARES Act and extended by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages
exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are
generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans
modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications
and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where
the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction.
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At September 30, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified
in TDRs were four years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure
At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.
government agencies, with a carrying value of $693 million and $846 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but
were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay
recognition of foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(b) At September 30, 2021, auto and other loans excluded $126 million of PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA that are 30 or more days past due. These

amounts have been excluded based upon the SBA guarantee. At December 31, 2020, all PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA were current.

(c) At September 30, 2021, included $9.1 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $2.0 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.
PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual
nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(d) At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.

Loan modifications
Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to
be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,
were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been
modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020 were not material.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has
subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was
not material for the three and nine months ended months ended

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification
programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants
concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-
term programs. These modifications involve placing the
customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months,
and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit
card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than

in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they
defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified
credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s
standard charge-off policy.

(a) The U.S. and non-U.S. distribution is determined based predominantly on the domicile of the borrower.
(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still
within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. The credit quality of wholesale
loans is assessed primarily through ongoing review and monitoring of an obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations rather than relying on the past
due status, which is generally a lagging indicator of credit quality.

(c) Represents loans that are considered well-collateralized and therefore still accruing interest.

(a) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management

framework. As of September 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were considered performing.

(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically

occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

150

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as
they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or
other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm
has elected to apply the option to suspend the application
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES
Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The carrying value of TDRs was $928 million and
$954 million as of September 30, 2021, and December 31,
2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was
$180 million and $188 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and
$832 million and $352 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. New TDRs for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021
reflected deferral of principal and interest payments,
extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial
satisfaction of the loan predominantly in Other and
Commercial and Industrial loan classes.  The impact of
these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material
to the Firm for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020.

Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments.
Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and
the related accounting policies.

(a) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on investment securities of $73 million and $120 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $19.9 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit

card portfolio segment; $710.6 billion and $662.9 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $41.0 billion and $24.4 billion,
respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. Prior-period amount for
wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates

periods.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021
was $20.5 billion, a decrease from $30.8 billion at
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for
credit losses reflected:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in
the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs,
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook.

The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in
the Firm's allowance estimate which has created challenges
in the use of modeled credit loss estimates, increased the
reliance on management judgment, and resulted in
adjustments to appropriately address the economic
circumstances. These adjustments continued through the
third quarter of 2021, although to a lesser extent than
experienced during 2020.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse
scenarios. However, uncertainties remain, including the
impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may
have on the pace of economic growth, the strength of
underlying labor markets with the expiration of government
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in
consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on
certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm
retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in
the third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of
2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022
and falling below 6% in the third quarter of 2022, and a
weighted average cumulative change in U.S. GDP of 3.8% in
the fourth quarter of 2022.

Note 13 – Variable interest entities
Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies
regarding consolidation of VIEs. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of VIEs,
including the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a
“Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE
is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or
(4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial
interests in the securitization trusts.

155

The following tables present the total unpaid principal
amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

(e) As of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 73% of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair
value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The
retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $131 million and
$41 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The retained interests in
commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $854 million and
$753 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

private-label re-securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$12.5 billion and $13.5 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other
than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$12.5 billion and $12.2 billion at September 30, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively, and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of
JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.7 billion and $5.2 billion at September 30, 2021,
and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing

158

member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $24.7
billion and $23.6 billion, of which $8.6 billion and $8.7
billion was unfunded at September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period
maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to
conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses
each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold
varying amounts of its capital investment until the project
qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on
affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-
Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders
for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at  September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020 was $6.9 billion and $6.7 billion,
respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $10.6
billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
and commercial mortgages.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by
the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for

Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

related to prior period acquisitions.

Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to
Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic on business performance, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and
projections of business performance. The Firm has
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of
September 30, 2021, or December 31, 2020, nor was
goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 or 2020.

161

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a
short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and

expected prepayments.

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and

changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one
factor may result in changes in another, which would either
magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and
outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as
defined below.

Note 20 – Restricted cash and other restricted
assets
Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other
restricted assets.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s
restricted cash:

subsidiaries are subject.
(a) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as

supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for
BHC and IDI subsidiaries, respectively.

(b) The Federal Reserve's regulations do not establish well-capitalized

CECL regulatory capital transition delay
As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule
that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to
delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning
January 1, 2022.

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended
September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm
exclude $3.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact
to retained earnings and 25% of the $1.9 billion increase
in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 27 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information
on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized risk-based ratios to which the Firm and its IDI
subsidiaries were subject as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III
Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by
the federal banking agencies.

(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed
capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to
the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB
surcharge.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the
Firm’s related accounting policies.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments.

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The
amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and
certain scored business banking lending-related
commitments represent the total available credit for these
products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these
products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can
reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business
banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or,
in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In
addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the
borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce
or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the
value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.
(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.
(d) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $48 million and $72 million,

respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $7.9 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees; and $609 million and $357 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments
are shown gross of risk participations.

(e) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $324.0
billion  and $264.3 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S.
GSEs and government agencies.

(f) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo

program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(g) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, unfunded

commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, and other equity investment commitments,

(h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(i) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-

related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under

multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a

173

third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-
backs.

174

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become
sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also
guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and
performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective
obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its
liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house
therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 173. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 173 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for additional information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.

Pledged assets
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation

Contingencies
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations,
government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and
regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of
business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and
statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.5 billion at September 30, 2021. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase
entities into residential housing projects developed by the
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors
filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India
and is ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately
$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”).  In May
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major
international oil companies. The account held
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been
scheduled to commence in February 2022.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In
January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment

176

entered thereafter and a term of probation which ended in
January 2020, with the Firm remaining in good standing
throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor
granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification
that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
until January 2023. The Firm will need the Department of
Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the
remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. A South
Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-
related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.

In August 2018, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York granted final approval to the
Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of
federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to
manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought
damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures
and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement
class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the
class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm
and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A
number of these actions remain pending. Further, a
putative class action has been filed against the Firm and
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain
consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly
inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought
against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on
behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments.
In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and
11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10
million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative
class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct
have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel,
Brazil and Australia.

Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. The Firm
has been responding to requests for information and other
material from certain of its regulators concerning its
compliance with records preservation requirements in
connection with business communications sent over
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved
by the Firm.  The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries
and is currently engaged in certain advanced resolution
discussions. There is no assurance that the discussions will
result in a resolution.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded

to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized
an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior
settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the
defendants collectively contributed an additional $900
million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in
escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019,
the amended agreement was approved by the District
Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s
approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on
the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The class action seeking
primarily injunctive relief continues separately, and in
September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’
motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion
in part.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District
Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm,
to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have

177

appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging
that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an
unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired
to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans
and credit cards. In November 2020 and May 2021,
plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction each
seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR
and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial
instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The court held a
hearing to address these motions in September 2021. The
Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss
franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and
Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective
investigations relating to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S.
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to
2016.

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after
three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully
comply with all of their obligations.

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the
total monetary amount includes victim compensation
payments.

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Firm and certain former employees,
alleging a precious metals futures and options price
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019,
and the consolidated action is stayed through December
2021. In July 2021, the parties informed the Court that
they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action. In
Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class
action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying

conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative
class actions were filed in the United States District Courts
for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of
New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S.
Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the
Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also
allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern
District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern
District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative
class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their
consolidated amended complaint in April 2021. In May
2021, the parties informed the Court that they have
entered into a settlement to resolve the action.

In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during
the putative class period were materially false and
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants are opposing.

Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have
been investigating a series of transactions entered into by
senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”)
during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure
their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a
number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. cooperated with the investigation. The
investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in
November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to
the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in
tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued
a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court,
ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a
prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January

178

consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi
referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal
correctionnel. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021
that it had no power to take further action against
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. following the Court of
Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers
of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel
directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further
investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., pending which the trial was postponed. In April
2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of
the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In
August 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a
Convention Judicaire d’Intérêt Public with the French
criminal authorities, under which it agreed to pay a fine of
€25 million to resolve the potential legal proceedings.  The
resolution, which did not contain any admissions, was
approved by the Presiding Judge of the tribunal judiciaire,
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid the fine in September
2021. In addition, a number of the managers have
commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different
allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $76 million and
$524 million for the three months ended September 30,
2021 and 2020, respectively, and $289 million and $839
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
2020. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation
reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or

179

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are
determined based on the products and services provided, or
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in
which financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis.
The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm
Segment results and reconciliation(a)

(and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE
basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of
the Firm’s management.  We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.  We conducted our review in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB.  A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

November 2, 2021

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of September 30, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and
2020 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we
are not aware of any material modifications that should be
made to the accompanying interim financial statements for
them to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of
the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year
then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated
February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing
a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on
certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial
statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

criteria

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However,
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to present
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management
also uses this financial measure at the segment level,
because it believes this provides information to enable

performance and trends of the particular business segment
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with
the performance of competitors.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a

without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

187

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period
presented.

cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs
generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for
interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically
maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs, which
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock
and participating securities, based on their respective rights
to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

188

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer
spread, which is the difference between the price at which
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and
the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and
losses on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive

approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced.

principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates
or indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results,
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is
derived from a weighted average of the performance
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer

192

categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and
five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers.
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.

Refer to the Market Risk Management section of
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 135–142
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting” on page 158 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three
months ended September 30, 2021, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II – Other Information

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information
that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3:
Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:
Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented,
sets forth the material risk factors that could affect
JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations.
Readers should not consider any descriptions of such
factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could
affect the Firm.

Ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm
the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan
Chase’s businesses.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic,
which included the institution of social distancing and
shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S.
and other countries, have resulted in adverse impacts on
global economic conditions, including:

•

•

•

significant disruption and volatility in the financial
markets

significant disruption of global supply chains, and

closures of many businesses, leading to loss of
revenues and increased unemployment.

The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses and results of operations, including:
•

reduction in demand for certain products and services
from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting
in lower revenue, and

•

increases in the allowance for credit losses.

Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with
the determination of the allowance for credit losses have
experienced heightened performance risk in the economic
environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no
assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to
model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize
unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that
has resulted from these developments.

Although global economic conditions have been improving
despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any
ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the
pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the
pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or

194

variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other
diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant
adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and financial condition, including:

•

recognition of charge-offs and increases in the
allowance for credit losses, including any delayed
recognition of charge-offs  due to the impact of
government stimulus actions or payment assistance
provided to clients and customers

• material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives
and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase
owns or in which it makes markets

•

•

•

downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings

constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels
of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”)
related to supporting client activities, downgrades in
client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors,
any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to
take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise
would under its liquidity and capital management
strategies, and

the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan
Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively,
including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-
place arrangements, government actions or other
restrictions in connection with the pandemic.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are
uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including:

•

•

•

•

the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic

the availability, effectiveness and acceptance of
vaccines

actions taken by governmental authorities and other
third parties in response to the pandemic, and

the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or
worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of

economic growth, the strength of labor markets,
particularly in light of the expiration of government
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in
consumer behavior that could have longer-term
impacts on certain sectors.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or
indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or
by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed
to support individuals, households and businesses impacted
by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase
to:

•

•

•

increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny

negative publicity, and

increased exposure to litigation,

any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of
operations and financial condition, it may also have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in
Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Supervision and regulation
Refer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 3–
7 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information on
Supervision and Regulation.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds.

The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity
securities during the three months ended September 30,
2021.

Repurchases under the common share repurchase
program
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of this
Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the
Firm’s common share repurchase program.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized
a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and
common stock dividends in the first and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the
Firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary restrictions on capital distributions would expire on
June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the 2021 CCAR
stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the
regulatory capital framework. The Firm continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares under its existing common
share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors.

195
