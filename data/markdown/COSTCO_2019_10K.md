Item 1—Business

PART I

Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally
engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan,
Korea,  Australia,  Spain,  France,  Iceland,  China,  and  through  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  in  Taiwan.  Costco  operated  782,  762,  and  741
warehouses worldwide at September 1, 2019, September 2, 2018, and September 3, 2017, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”

We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three
quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The
material  seasonal  impact  in  our  operations  is  increased  net  sales  and  earnings  during  the  winter  holiday  season.  References  to  2019 and  2018
relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal
year ended September 3, 2017.

General

We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and
private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating
efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities,
these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other
retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.

We  buy  most  of  our  merchandise  directly  from  manufacturers  and  route  it  to  cross-docking  consolidation  points  (depots)  or  directly  to  our
warehouses.  Our  depots  receive  large  shipments  from  manufacturers  and  quickly  ship  these  goods  to  warehouses.  This  process  creates  freight
volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.

Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy
and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise,

Table of Contents

and  the  control  of  inventory.  Because  shoppers  are  attracted  principally  by  the  quality  of  merchandise  and  low  prices,  our  warehouses  are  not
elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below
those of typical retail operations.

Our  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended  hours.  Because  the  hours  of
operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the
volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor
required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash,
checks, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).

Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.
We seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per
warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case,
carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.

In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-
day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage
is sold on certain electronic items.

We offer merchandise in the following categories:

•

•

•

•

•

Food  and  Sundries (including  dry  foods,  packaged  foods,  groceries,  snack  foods,  candy,  alcoholic  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  and
cleaning supplies)

Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)

Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)

Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)

Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses)

Ancillary  businesses  within  or  next  to  our  warehouses  provide  expanded  products  and  services,  encouraging  members  to  shop  more  frequently.
These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses
with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we do not currently operate our gasoline business in Korea, France or China. We operated 593
gas stations at the end of 2019. Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 11% of total net sales in 2019.

Our  e-commerce  operations  allow  us  to  connect  with  our  members  online  and  provide  additional  products  and  services,  many  not  found  in  our
warehouses.  At  the  end  of  2019,  we  operated  e-commerce  websites  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Mexico,  U.K.,  Korea,  and  Taiwan.  Net  sales  for  e-
commerce represented approximately 4% of total net sales in 2019. Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and various other services online
in certain countries.

We  have  direct  buying  relationships  with  many  producers  of  national  brand-name  merchandise.  We  do  not  obtain  a  significant  portion  of
merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if
current  sources  of supply became  unavailable,  we would be able to obtain alternative  sources  without  substantial  disruption  of our business.  We
also  purchase  and  manufacture  private-label  merchandise,  as  long  as  quality  and  member  demand  are  high  and  the  value  to  our  members  is
significant.

Certain  financial  information  for  our  segments  and  geographic  areas  is  included  in  Note 11 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in
Item 8 of this Report.

Membership

Our  members  may  utilize  their  memberships  at  our  warehouses  worldwide.  Gold  Star  memberships  are  available  to  individuals;  Business
memberships  are  limited  to  businesses,  including  individuals  with  a  business  license,  retail  sales  license  or  comparable  document.  Business
members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our
annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free
household card.

Our member  renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada and  88% on a worldwide basis at the end of  2019. The majority of members renew
within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen
months prior to the reporting date.

Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Paid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $60.
Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., and Korea, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2%
reward  on  qualified  purchases  (up  to  a  maximum  reward  of  $1,000  per  year  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  and  varies  in  Mexico,  the  U.K.  and  Korea),
which  can  be  redeemed  only  at  Costco  warehouses.  This  program  also  offers  (except  in  Mexico  and  Korea),  access  to  additional  savings  and
benefits  on various  business  and consumer  services,  such  as auto  and home insurance,  the Costco  auto purchase  program,  and check  printing.
These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 39% of paid members at
the end of 2019, generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members.

Competition

Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy,
and  customer  service.  We  compete  on  a  worldwide  basis  with  global,  national,  and  regional  wholesalers  and  retailers,  including  supermarkets,
supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and  specialty  stores,  and  operators  selling  a  single  category  or
narrow  range  of  merchandise.  Walmart,  Target,  Kroger,  and  Amazon.com  are  among  our  significant  general  merchandise  retail  competitors.  We
also compete with other warehouse clubs (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and many of the major metropolitan areas in
the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple club operations.

Intellectual Property

We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and
similar  intellectual  property  add  significant  value  to  our  business  and  are  important  to  our  success.  We  have  invested  significantly  in  the
development  and  protection  of  our  well-recognized  brands,  including  the  Costco  Wholesale® trademarks  and  our  private-label  brand,  Kirkland
Signature®.  We  believe  that  Kirkland  Signature  products  are  high quality,  offered  to  our  members  at  prices  that  are  generally  lower  than  national
brands,  and  that  they  help  lower  costs,  differentiate  our  merchandise  offerings,  and  generally  earn  higher  margins.  We  expect  to  continue  to
increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.

We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees
and  others  to  protect  our  intellectual  property.  The  availability  and  duration  of  trademark  registrations  vary  by  country;  however,  trademarks  are
generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.

Available Information

Our U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those
reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that
contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the
SEC at www.sec.gov.

We have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available
free  of  charge  by  writing  to  Secretary,  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation,  999  Lake  Drive,  Issaquah,  WA  98027.  If  the  Company  makes  any
amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to
the CEO, chief financial officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report filed with the
SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.

Item 1A—Risk Factors

The  risks  described  below  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  We  could  also  be
affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or
that  we  currently  consider  to  be  immaterial.  These  Risk  Factors  should  be  carefully  reviewed  in  conjunction  with  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Item 7 and our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes  in  Item 8 of this
Report.

Business and Operating Risks

We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.

Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 84% of net sales
and operating income in 2019, respectively. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 30% of U.S. net
sales in 2019. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.
Any  substantial  slowing  or  sustained  decline  in  these  operations  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business  and  financial  results.  Declines  in
financial  performance  of  our  U.S.  operations,  particularly  in  California,  and  our  Canadian  operations  could  arise  from,  among  other  things:  slow
growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare
and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward
lower  gross  margin  products;  changes  or  uncertainties  in  economic  conditions  in  our  markets,  including  higher  levels  of  unemployment  and
depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.

We  may  be  unsuccessful  implementing  our  growth  strategy,  including  expanding  our  business  in  existing  markets  and  new  markets,
which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers
and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots,
as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting
our  operations  and  environmental  regulations,  may  impact  our  ability  to  find  suitable  locations  and  increase  the  cost  of  sites  and  of  constructing,
leasing  and  operating  warehouses  and  depots.  We  also  may  have  difficulty  negotiating  leases  or  purchase  agreements  on  acceptable  terms.  In
addition,  certain  jurisdictions  have  enacted  or  proposed  laws  and  regulations  that  would  prevent  or  restrict  the  operation  or  expansion  plans  of
certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely
build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.

We  seek  to  expand  in  existing  markets  to  attain  a  greater  overall  market  share.  A  new  warehouse  may  draw  members  away  from  our  existing
warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.

We intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets, including China. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack
of  familiarity  with  us,  attracting  members  of  other  wholesale  club  operators,  our  lesser  familiarity  with  local  member  preferences,  and  seasonal
differences  in  the  market.  Entry  into  new  markets  may  bring  us  into  competition  with  new  competitors  or  with  existing  competitors  with  a  large,
established  market  presence.  We  cannot  ensure  that  new  warehouses  and  new  e-commerce  websites  will  be  profitable  and,  as  a  result,  future
profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents

Our failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.

Membership  loyalty  and  growth  are  essential  to  our  business.  The  extent  to  which  we  achieve  growth  in  our  membership  base,  increase  the
penetration of Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may
negatively  impact  comparable  sales,  diminish  member  trust,  and  reduce  renewal  rates  and,  accordingly,  net  sales  and  membership  fee  revenue,
negatively impacting our results of operations.

We  sell  many  products  under  our  Kirkland  Signature  brand.  Maintaining  consistent  product  quality,  competitive  pricing,  and  availability  of  these
products  is  essential  to  developing  and  maintaining  member  loyalty.  These  products  also  generally  carry  higher  margins  than  national  brand
products  carried  in  our  warehouses  and  represent  a  growing  portion  of  our  overall  sales.  If  the  Kirkland  Signature  brand  experiences  a  loss  of
member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.

Disruptions  in  our  merchandise  distribution  or  processing,  packaging,  manufacturing,  and  other  facilities  could  adversely  affect  sales
and member satisfaction.

We  depend  on  the  orderly  operation  of  the  merchandise  receiving  and  distribution  process,  primarily  through  our  depots.  We  also  rely  upon
processing,  packaging,  manufacturing  and  other  facilities  to  support  our  business,  which  includes  the  production  of  certain  private-label  items.
Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor
issues  or  other  shipping  problems  may  result  in  delays  in  the  production  and  delivery  of  merchandise  to  our  warehouses,  which  could  adversely
affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.

We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members,
the demand for our products and services, and our market share.

It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our
ability  to  identify  and  respond  to  trends  in  demographics  and  consumer  preferences.  Failure  to  identify  timely  or  effectively  respond  to  changing
consumer  tastes,  preferences  (including  those  relating  to  sustainability  of  product  sources  and  animal  welfare)  and  spending  patterns  could
negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. If we are not successful at
predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and
reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.

We rely extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage our business. Failure or disruption
of  our  primary  and  back-up  systems  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  A  failure  to  adequately  update  our  existing  systems  and
implement new systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.

Given the very high volume of transactions we process it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical systems. Our
systems,  including  our  back-up  systems,  are  subject  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  outages,  computer  and  telecommunications  failures,
computer  viruses,  internal or external  security  breaches,  catastrophic  events such as fires,  earthquakes,  tornadoes  and hurricanes,  and errors  or
misfeasance by our employees. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or
replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations. Any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

We  are  currently  making  and  will  continue  to  make  investments  to  improve  or  advance  critical  information  systems  and  processing  capabilities.
Failure  to  monitor  and  choose  the  right  investments  and  implement  them  at  the  right  pace  could  be  harmful.  The  risk  of  system  disruption  is
increased  when  significant  system  changes  are  undertaken,  although  we  believe  that  our  change  management  process  should  mitigate  this  risk.
Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more

9

Table of Contents

difficult  for  us  to  realize  benefits.  Targeting  the  wrong  opportunities,  failing  to  make  the  best  investments,  or  making  an  investment  commitment
significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of
operations. The potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our
operations. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.

We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls and if
we  fail  to  maintain  an  effective  system  of  internal  control  in  the  future,  this  could  result  in  loss  of  investor  confidence  and  adversely
impact our stock price.

Internal  controls  related  to  the  operation  of  technology  systems  are  critical  to  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  We
reported  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  as  of  September  2,  2018,  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information
technology  general  controls  (ITGCs)  in  the  areas  of  user  access  and  program  change-management  over  certain  information  technology  systems
that support the Company’s financial reporting processes. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness
and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 1, 2019. Completion of remediation does not provide
assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial
statements  within  required  time  periods  could  be  adversely  affected,  which  could  subject  us  to  litigation  or  investigations  requiring  management
resources  and  payment  of  legal  and  other  expenses,  negatively  affect  investor  confidence  in  our  financial  statements  and  adversely  impact  our
stock price.

If we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, we could damage our reputation with members and
employees, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.

We  receive,  retain,  and  transmit  personal  information  about  our  members  and  employees  and  entrust  that  information  to  third-party  business
associates,  including  cloud  service-providers  that  perform  activities  for  us.  Our  warehouse  and  online  businesses  depend  upon  the  secure
transmission  of  confidential  information  over  public  networks,  including  information  permitting  cashless  payments.  A  compromise  of  our  security
systems  or  defects  within  our  hardware  or  software,  or  those  of  our  business  associates,  that  results  in  our  members'  or  employees'  information
being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations,  results of
operations,  financial  condition  and  liquidity,  and  could  result  in  litigation,  government  actions,  or  the  imposition  of  penalties.  In  addition,  a  breach
could require expending significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could disrupt our operations.

The use of data by our business and our business associates is highly regulated in all of our operating countries. Privacy and information-security
laws  and  regulations  change,  and  compliance  with  them  may  result  in  cost  increases  due  to,  among  other  things,  systems  changes  and  the
development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with laws and regulations, such as the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost business,
and we could be subjected to additional legal risk or financial losses as a result of non-compliance.

We have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our
information technology network. These measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or
external malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and
personal  information.  Because  the  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems  change
frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or
implement adequate

10

Table of Contents

preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation,
and potentially have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We are subject to payment-related risks.

We  accept  payments  using  a  variety  of  methods,  including  cash  and  checks,  select  credit  and  debit  cards,  and  our  shop  card.  As  we  offer  new
payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain
payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties
to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these companies
become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to evolving payment card association and network operating rules,
including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card
Industry  Data  Security  Standards  (“PCI  DSS”),  which  contain  compliance  guidelines  and  standards  with  regard  to  our  security  surrounding  the
physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we
may  be  liable  for  card  re-issuance  costs,  subject  to  fines  and  higher  transaction  fees  and  lose  our  ability  to  accept  card  payments  from  our
members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

We might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.

If our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable goods,
do  not  meet  or  are  perceived  not  to  meet  applicable  safety  standards  or  our  members' expectations  regarding  safety,  we  could  experience  lost
sales, increased  costs,  litigation or reputational  harm.  The sale of these items involves  the risk of health-related  illness or injury to our members.
Such  illnesses  or  injuries  could  result  from  tampering  by  unauthorized  third  parties,  product  contamination  or  spoilage,  including  the  presence  of
foreign  objects,  substances,  chemicals,  other  agents,  or  residues  introduced  during  the  growing,  manufacturing,  storage,  handling  and
transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent
on  them  to  ensure  that  the  products  we  buy  comply  with  safety  and  other  standards.  While  we  are  subject  to  governmental  inspection  and
regulations  and  work  to  comply  in  all  material  respects  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  consumption  or  use  of  our
products  will  not  cause  illness  or  injury  or  that  we  will  not  be  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  or  government  investigations  relating  to  such  matters,
resulting  in costly  product  recalls  and other  liabilities  that  could adversely  affect  our business  and results  of operations.  Even  if  a product  liability
claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our
corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term.

If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be
adversely impacted.

Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors.
Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We
are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology
in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

11

Table of Contents

Inability  to  attract,  train  and  retain  highly  qualified  employees  could  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

Our  success  depends  on  the  continued  contributions  of  members  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  operations,  merchandising  and
administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for key senior management could negatively impact our business. We
must  attract,  train  and  retain  a  large  and  growing  number  of  qualified  employees,  while  controlling  related  labor  costs  and  maintaining  our  core
values.  Our  ability  to control  labor and benefit  costs  is subject  to  numerous  internal  and external  factors,  including regulatory  changes,  prevailing
wage  rates,  and  healthcare  and  other  insurance  costs.  We  compete  with  other  retail  and  non-retail  businesses  for  these  employees  and  invest
significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the
future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.

The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’
and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very
large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory
requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the
failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Although we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage
to,  or the  destruction  of,  any warehouses,  depots,  manufacturing  or home office  facilities,  loss or spoilage of inventory,  and business  interruption
caused  by  any  such  events  to  the  extent  they  are  below  catastrophic  levels  of  coverage,  as  well  as  any  losses  to  the  extent  they  exceed  our
aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.

Market and Other External Risks

We  face  strong  competition  from  other  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a
wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-
club  operators,  supermarkets,  supercenters,  internet  retailers,  gasoline  stations,  hard  discounters,  department  and specialty  stores  and operators
selling  a  single  category  or  narrow  range  of  merchandise.  Such  retailers  and  warehouse  club  operators  compete  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including
pricing,  selection  and  availability,  services,  location,  convenience,  store  hours,  and  the  attractiveness  and  ease  of  use  of  websites  and  mobile
applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced
competition. Some competitors may have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market
penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could
result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.

General  economic  factors,  domestically  and  internationally,  may  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of
operations.

Higher  energy  and  gasoline  costs,  inflation,  levels  of  unemployment,  healthcare  costs,  consumer  debt  levels,  foreign-currency  exchange  rates,
unsettled financial markets,  weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to
government fiscal and tax policies including changes in tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, and other

12

Table of Contents

economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to
purchase inventory. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to tariff
impacts  on  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on  (among  other  things)  the  type  of  goods,  rates
imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and
pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an
adverse impact on our financial results.

Prices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically
volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  labor  costs,  competition,  market
speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and
desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and
selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can
also be affected by events like the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism.

Suppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards,
resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.

We depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue
to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the
terms  upon  which  they  sell  to  us  or  discontinue  selling  to  us.  Member  demands  may  lead  to  out-of-stock  positions  leading  to  loss  of  sales  and
profits.

We buy from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the
loss  of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to  develop  relationships  with  new  suppliers,  and  products  from  alternative
sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply
may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.

Our  suppliers  (and  those  they  depend  upon  for  materials  and  services)  are  subject  to  risks,  including  labor  disputes,  union  organizing  activities,
financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability
to  timely  provide  us  with  acceptable  merchandise.  One  or  more  of  our  suppliers  might  not  adhere  to  our  quality  control,  legal,  regulatory,  labor,
environmental  or  animal  welfare  standards.  These  deficiencies  may  delay  or  preclude  delivery  of  merchandise  to  us  and  might  not  be  identified
before  we  sell  such  merchandise  to  our  members.  This  failure  could  lead  to  recalls  and  litigation  and  otherwise  damage  our  reputation  and  our
brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.

During 2019,  our  international  operations,  including  Canada,  generated  27% and  35% of  our  net  sales  and  operating  income,  respectively.  Our
international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our
consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using
current  exchange  rates.  Future  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  that  are  unfavorable  to  us  may  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  our
Canadian  and  Other  International  operations  and  have  a  corresponding  adverse  period-over-period  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  As  we
continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.

13

Table of Contents

A portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency
fluctuations  may increase  our cost  of goods and may  not be passed on to members.  Consequently,  fluctuations  in currency  exchange rates  may
adversely affect our results of operations.

Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Natural  disasters,  such  as  hurricanes,  typhoons  or  earthquakes,  particularly  in  California  or  Washington  state,  where  our  centralized  operating
systems  and  administrative  personnel  are  located,  could  negatively  affect  our  operations  and  financial  performance.  Such  events  could  result  in
physical damage to our properties, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an
adequate  work  force,  the  temporary  or  long-term  disruption  in  the  supply  of  products  from  some  local  or  overseas  suppliers,  the  temporary
disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in
the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the
operations  of  suppliers  or  members,  or  have  an  adverse  impact  on  consumer  spending  and  confidence  levels.  These  events  could  also  reduce
demand  for  our  products  or  make  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  procure  products.  We  may  be  required  to  suspend  operations  in  some  or  all  of  our
locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.

We  use  natural  gas,  diesel  fuel,  gasoline,  and  electricity  in  our  distribution  and  warehouse  operations.  U.S.  and  foreign  government  regulations
limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation affecting energy
inputs could materially affect our profitability. Climate change and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and
snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We
also  sell  a  substantial  amount  of  gasoline,  the  demand  for  which  could  be  impacted  by  concerns  about  climate  change  and  which  could  face
increased regulation.

Failure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.

We  believe  that  the  price  of  our  stock  currently  reflects  high  market  expectations  for  our  future  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  meet  or  delay  in
meeting  these  expectations,  including  our  warehouse  and  e-commerce  comparable  sales  growth  rates,  membership  renewal  rates,  new  member
sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the market
price of our stock to decline.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Our  international  operations  subject  us  to  risks  associated  with  the  legislative,  judicial,  accounting,  regulatory,  political  and  economic
factors  specific  to  the  countries  or  regions  in  which  we  operate,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and
results of operations.

At  the  end  of  2019,  we  operated  239 warehouses  outside  of  the  U.S.,  and  we  plan  to  continue  expanding  our  international  operations.  Future
operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are
beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes such as the
U.K.'s vote to withdraw from the European Union, commonly  known as "Brexit",  and other matters  in any of the countries or regions in which we
operate,  now  or  in  the  future.  Other  factors  that  may  impact  international  operations  include  foreign  trade  (including  tariffs  and  trade  sanctions),
monetary  and  fiscal  policies  and  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the  U.S.  and  foreign  governments,  agencies  and  similar  organizations,  and  risks
associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations
also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of

14

Table of Contents

managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting
matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Accounting  principles  and  related  pronouncements,  implementation  guidelines,  and  interpretations  we  apply  to  a  wide  range  of  matters  that  are
relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities and income taxes, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and
judgments  by  our  management.  Changes  in  rules  or  interpretation  or  changes  in  underlying  assumptions,  estimates  or  judgments  by  our
management  could  significantly  change  our reported  or  expected  financial  performance  and have  a material  impact  on our  consolidated  financial
statements.

We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any
point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize
additional  tax  expense,  be  subject  to  additional  tax  liabilities,  or  incur  losses  and  penalties,  due  to  changes  in  laws,  regulations,  administrative
practices,  principles,  assessments  by  authorities  and  interpretations  related  to  tax,  including  tax  rules  in  various  jurisdictions.  We  compute  our
income  tax  provision  based  on  enacted  tax  rates  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate.  As  tax  rates  vary  among  countries,  a  change  in  earnings
attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes
in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Significant changes in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials,
hazardous  and  non-hazardous  wastes  and  other  environmental  matters  could  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition  and
results of operations.

We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and
disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these laws could
result  in  harm  to  our  members,  employees  or  others,  significant  costs  to  satisfy  environmental  compliance,  remediation  or  compensatory
requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our  business  requires  compliance  with  many  laws  and  regulations.  Failure  to  achieve  compliance  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits  and  other
proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings
and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws,
and  other  litigation.  We  cannot  predict  with  certainty  the  outcomes  of  these  proceedings  and  other  contingencies,  including  environmental
remediation  and  other  proceedings  commenced  by  governmental  authorities.  The  outcome  of  some  of  these  proceedings,  audits,  unclaimed
property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could
require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against
these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.

merchandise shipments to the warehouses. Additionally, we operate various fulfillment, processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to
support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Our executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, and
we maintain 19 regional offices in the U.S., Canada and Other International locations.

Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except per share,
share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)

Overview

We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. We define comparable sales as
sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites
operating  for  more  than  one  year.  Comparable  sales  growth  is  achieved  through  increasing  shopping  frequency  from  new  and  existing  members
and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond
our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); changes in the
cost  of  gasoline  and  associated  competitive  conditions;  and  changes  from  the  revenue  recognition  standard.  The  higher  our  comparable  sales
exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of
sales  and  enhancing  profitability.  Generating  comparable  sales  growth  is  foremost  a  question  of  making  available  to  our  members  the  right
merchandise  at  the  right  prices,  a  skill  that  we  believe  we  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  over  the  long  term.  Another  substantial  factor  in  sales
growth  is  the  health  of  the  economies  in  which  we  do  business,  including  the  effects  of  inflation  or  deflation,  especially  the  United  States.  Sales
growth  and  gross  margins  are  also  impacted  by  our  competition,  which  is  vigorous  and  widespread,  across  a  wide  range  of  global,  national  and
regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health
or  changes  in  competition,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  successful  historically  in  adapting  our  business  to  these  changes,  such  as  through
adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.

Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short term on maximizing
prices  charged,  but  instead  seek  to  maintain  what  we  believe  is  a  perception  among  our  members  of  our  “pricing  authority”  on  quality  goods  –
consistently  providing the most competitive  values. Our investments  in merchandise  pricing may include reducing  prices on merchandise  to drive
sales  or  meet  competition  and  holding  prices  steady  despite  cost  increases  instead  of  passing  the  increases  on  to  our  members,  all  negatively
impacting  gross  margin  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales  (gross  margin  percentage).  We  believe  that  our  gasoline  business  draws  members  but  it
generally  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  non-gasoline  business.  A  higher  penetration  of  gasoline  sales  will
generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally,
rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases
our  selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales.  A  decline  in  gasoline  prices  has  the  inverse  effect.
Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the
costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing
of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost
increases. While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our results.

We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to
secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however,
including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur
in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is
generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth,
domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales.

20

Table of Contents

The  membership  format  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business  and  has  a  significant  effect  on  our  profitability.  This  format  is  designed  to  reinforce
member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our
Executive  members,  and  sustain  high  renewal  rates  materially  influences  our  profitability.  Our  paid  membership  growth  rate  may  be  adversely
impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.

Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant
costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our
philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee
turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our
workforce.  This  may  cause  us,  for  example,  to  absorb  costs  that  other  employers  might  seek  to  pass  through  to  their  workforces.  Because  our
business  is  operated  on  very  low  margins,  modest  changes  in  various  items  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise
costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.

Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements  included in Item 8 of this Report).  Certain countries in the Other International  segment have relatively higher rates of square
footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition.

In  discussions  of our consolidated  operating  results,  we  refer  to the  impact  of  changes in foreign  currencies  relative  to  the U.S.  dollar,  which are
references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local
currencies  into  U.S.  dollars  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  This  impact  of  foreign-exchange  rate  changes  is  calculated  based  on  the  difference
between  the  current  period's  currency  exchange  rates  and  that  of  the  comparable  prior  period.  The  impact  of  changes  in  gasoline  prices  on  net
sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.

Our  fiscal  year  ends  on  the  Sunday  closest  to  August  31.  References  to  2019 and  2018 relate  to  the  52-week  fiscal  years  ended  September 1,
2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended  September 3, 2017. Certain percentages
presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to
Costco.

Highlights for 2019 included:

• We opened 25 new warehouses, including 5 relocations: 16 net new locations in the U.S. and  4 in our Other International segment, including

our first warehouse in China, compared to 25 new warehouses, including 4 relocations in 2018;
Net sales increased 8% to $149,351 driven by a 6% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018 and 2019;
•
• Membership fee revenue increased 7% to $3,352, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee

increase in the U.S. and Canada in June 2017.

• Gross  margin  percentage  decreased  two basis  points.  Excluding  the  impact  of  the  new  revenue  recognition  standard  on  net  sales,  gross

•

margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales increased eight basis points;
Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased two basis points. Excluding the impact of the new
revenue recognition standard on net sales, SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales increased 11 basis points, primarily related to a $123
charge for a product tax assessment;

Effective March 2019, starting and supervisor wages were increased and paid bonding leave was made available for hourly employees in the
U.S. and Canada. The estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these increases is approximately $50-$60;
The effective tax rate in 2019 was 22.3% compared to 28.4% in 2018. Both years were favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017
Tax Act) and other net tax benefits;
Net income increased 17% to $3,659, or $8.26 per diluted share compared to $3,134, or $7.09 per diluted share in 2018; and
In April 2019, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.65 per share and authorized a new
share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000.

Net Sales

Net sales increased $10,917 or 8% during 2019, primarily due to a 6% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2018
and 2019.

Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,463, or 106 basis points, compared to
2018, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations. The revenue recognition standard positively impacted net sales by $1,332, or
96 basis points. Changes in gasoline prices did not have a material impact on net sales.

Comparable Sales

Comparable  sales  increased  6% during  2019 and  were  positively  impacted  by  increases  in  both  shopping  frequency  and  average  ticket.
Comparable sales were negatively impacted by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).

The increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and the annual fee increase. Changes
in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $30 in 2019. At the end of 2019, our member
renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide.

As reported  in 2017, we increased our annual membership  fees in the U.S. and Canada and in certain of our Other  International  operations.  We
account  for  membership  fee  revenue  on  a  deferred  basis,  recognized  ratably  over  the  one-year  membership  period.  These  fee  increases  had  a
positive impact of approximately $178 in 2018 and positively impacted 2019, primarily the first two quarters, by approximately $73.

The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of
core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased seven basis points primarily due to increases in food and sundries and fresh foods
partially offset by decreases in softlines and hardlines. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from
our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.

Total  gross  margin  percentage  decreased  two  basis  points  compared  to  2018.  Excluding  the  impact  of  the  revenue  recognition  standard  on  net
sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.12%, an increase of eight basis points. This increase was primarily due to a 19
basis  point  increase  in  our  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  predominantly  our  gasoline  business.  This  increase  was  partially  offset  by
decreases of four basis points in our core merchandise categories, four basis points due to an adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards
earned under our co-branded credit card program and three basis points due to increased spending by members under the Executive Membership
2% reward program. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $155 in 2019.

The  segment  gross  margin  percentage,  when  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  segment's  own  sales  and  excluding  the  impact  of  changes  in
gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. operations, predominantly in our warehouse ancillary and
other  businesses,  primarily  our  gasoline  business.  This  increase  was  partially  offset  by  decreases  in  our  core  merchandise  categories  and  the
breakage  adjustment  noted above. The segment gross  margin percentage  in our  Canadian operations  decreased predominantly  in hardlines  and
softlines  and  certain  of  our  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  fresh  foods.  The  segment  gross  margin
percentage  in  our  Other  International  operations  decreased  primarily  in  our  core  merchandise  categories  and  due  to  the  introduction  of  the
Executive Membership 2% reward program in Korea. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business.

standard on net sales, SG&A expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 10.13%, an increase of 11 basis points. This increase is largely
due to a $123 charge, or eight basis points, recorded in the U.S. related to a product tax assessment. Central operating costs were higher by two
basis  points  and  stock  compensation  expense  was  higher  by  one  basis  point.  Operating  costs  as  a  percent  of  adjusted  net  sales  related  to
warehouses,  ancillary,  and  other  businesses,  which  includes  e-commerce  and  travel,  were  flat  despite  the  wage  increases  and  bonding  leave

Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets,
new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse
and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether a warehouse is owned or leased, and whether openings are in an
existing, new, or international market. In 2019, we opened our first warehouse in China. Subsequent to year end, operations commenced at our new

Our effective tax rate for 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate in December 2017 from 35% to 21%,
which was in effect for all of 2019, and compared to a higher blended rate effective for 2018. Net discrete tax benefits of $221 in 2019 included a
benefit of $59 related to the stock-based compensation accounting standard adopted in the first quarter of 2018. This also included a tax benefit of
$105 related to U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, offset by losses of foreign tax credits, which impacted the effective tax rate. The tax rate
for 2019 was 26.9%, excluding the net discrete tax benefits.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $9,444 and $7,259 at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of these balances, unsettled
credit  and  debit  card  receivables  represented  approximately  $1,434 and  $1,348 at  the  end  of  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  These  receivables
generally settle within four days. Cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $15 and $37 in 2019 and
2018, respectively, and positively impacted by $25 in 2017.

Management  believes  that  our  cash  position  and  operating  cash  flows  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  our  liquidity  and  capital  requirements  for  the
foreseeable future. We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements. We no longer
consider earnings after 2017 of our non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.

Table of Contents

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  totaled  $6,356 in  2019,  compared  to  $5,774 in  2018.  Our  cash  flow  provided  by  operations  is  primarily
derived  from  net  sales  and  membership  fees.  Cash  flow  used  in  operations  generally  consists  of  payments  to  our  merchandise  suppliers,
warehouse operating costs,  including payroll and employee benefits,  utilities,  and credit and debit card processing fees. Cash used in operations
also  includes  payments  for  income  taxes.  Changes  in  our  net  investment  in  merchandise  inventories  (the  difference  between  merchandise
inventories and accounts payable) is impacted  by several factors,  including how fast inventory is sold, payment terms with our suppliers, and the
amount of payables paid early to obtain discounts from our suppliers.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net  cash  used  in  investing  activities  totaled  $2,865 in  2019,  compared  to  $2,947 in  2018,  and primarily  related  to  capital  expenditures.  Net cash
flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of short-term investments.

Capital Expenditures

Our  primary  requirement  for  capital  is  acquiring  land,  buildings,  and  equipment  for  new  and  remodeled  warehouses.  Capital  is  also  required  for
information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. In 2019, we spent $2,998 on capital
expenditures,  and  it  is  our  current  intention  to  spend  approximately $3,000  to  $3,200 during fiscal 2020. These  expenditures  are  expected  to  be
financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 25 new warehouses, including five
relocations, in 2019, and plan to open approximately 22 additional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2020. There can be no assurance
that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,147 in 2019, compared to $1,281 in 2018. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to
the payment of dividends, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repurchases of common stock. Dividends totaling $1,038 were paid during
2019, of which $250 related to the dividend declared in August 2018. In August 2019, approximately $200 and $100 of Guaranteed Senior Notes
were issued by our Japanese subsidiary at fixed interest rates of 0.28% and 0.42%, respectively.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In  April  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  share  repurchase  program  in  the  amount  of  $4,000,  which  expires  in  April  2023.  This
authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237. During 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 1,097,000 and 1,756,000
shares  of  common  stock,  at  average  prices  of  $225.16 and  $183.13,  respectively,  totaling  approximately  $247 and  $322,  respectively.  The
remaining  amount  available  to  be  purchased  under  our  approved  plan was  $3,943 at the end of  2019.  These  amounts  may  differ  from  the  stock
repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each
fiscal year. Purchases are made from  time-to-time,  as conditions warrant, in the open market  or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under
SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.

Dividends

Cash dividends declared in 2019 totaled $2.44 per share, as compared to $2.14 per share in 2018. In April 2019, the Board of Directors increased
our quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.65 per share. In August 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount
of $0.65 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of 2019.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs

We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September 1, 2019, we had borrowing capacity under these
facilities  of  $865,  including  a  $400  revolving  line  of  credit,  which  expires  in  June  2020.  The  Company  currently  has  no  plans  to  draw  upon  this
facility.  Our international operations maintain $355 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities,  of which $150 is guaranteed by the
Company. There were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2019 and 2018.

The Company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $219. The outstanding commitments  under these
facilities at the end of 2019 totaled $145, most of which were standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities
have  various  expiration  dates,  most  of  which  are  within  one  year,  and  we  generally  intend  to  renew  these  facilities.  The  amount  of  borrowings
available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.

Contractual Obligations

At September 1, 2019, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows:

Contractual obligations
Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1)
Long-term debt(2)
Operating leases (3)
Construction and land obligations
Capital lease obligations(4)
Purchase obligations (equipment, services

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In  the  opinion  of  management,  we  have  no  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that  have  had  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have  a  material  current  or
future effect on our financial condition or financial statements, other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in Note 1 and
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (U.S.  GAAP)  requires
that  we  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  We  base  our
estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates.
For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
Report.

Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities

The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’
and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to seek to limit exposures arising from
very  large  losses.  We  use  different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  and  participate  in  a
reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience,
demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of
inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time. While we believe our estimates are reasonable and
provide  for  a  certain  degree  of  coverage  to  account  for  these  variables,  actual  claims  and  costs  could  differ  significantly  from  recorded  liabilities.
Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.

Income Taxes

The  determination  of  our  provision  for  income  taxes  requires  significant  judgment,  the  use  of  estimates,  and  the  interpretation  and  application  of
complex tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of
sustaining uncertain tax  positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after  determining a more-likely-than-not
probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions and
record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. The 2017 Tax Act includes various provisions that significantly altered
U.S. tax law, many of which impact our business (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)

Our  exposure  to  financial  market  risk  results  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  We  do  not  engage  in
speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments
considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-
term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The
primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short-term investments
are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.

28

Table of Contents

Our  policy  limits  investments  in the  U.S.  to  direct  U.S.  government  and  government  agency obligations,  repurchase  agreements  collateralized  by
U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances.
Our  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  invests  in  U.S.  government  and  government  agency  obligations  and  U.S.  government  and
government  agency  money  market  funds.  Our  Canadian  and  Other  International  subsidiaries’  investments  are  primarily  in  money  market  funds,
bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.

A 100 basis-point change in interest rates as of the end of 2019 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those
investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are
reflected within stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.

The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of
2019, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $6,852. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage
these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on
known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure
to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. We
seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the
Company's  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts,  see  Notes 1 and  3 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this  Report.  A
hypothetical  10%  strengthening  of  the  functional  currency  compared  to  the  non-functional  currency  exchange  rates  at  September 1, 2019, would
have  decreased  the  fair  value  of  the  contracts  by  $79  and  resulted  in  an  unrealized  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income  for  the  same
amount.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing
operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the
U.S.  and  Canada.  We  also  enter  into  variable-priced  contracts  for  some  purchases  of  electricity  and  natural  gas,  in  addition  to  fuel  for  our  gas
stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and
normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Costco Wholesale Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Costco  Wholesale  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the  Company)  as  of
September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the
52-week period ended September 1, 2019, the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 and the 53-week period ended  September 3, 2017, and
the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements).  In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 1, 2019 and September 2, 2018, and the results of its operations and its
cash  flows  for  the  52-week  period  ended  September  1,  2019,  the  52-week  period  ended  September  2,  2018 and  the  53-week  period  ended
September 3, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be
independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,  taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

30

Table of Contents

Evaluation of self-insurance liabilities

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims
experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of September 1, 2019
were $1,222 million.

We  identified  the  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  self-insurance  liabilities  as  a  critical  audit  matter  because  of  the  specialized  skills  necessary  to
evaluate  the  Company’s  actuarial  models  and  the  judgments  required  to  assess  the  underlying  assumptions  made  by  the  Company.  Key
assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates include: reporting and payment patterns used in the projections of the ultimate loss; loss
and  exposure  trends;  the  selected  loss  rates  and  initial  expected  losses  used  in  the  Paid  and  Incurred  Bornhuetter-Ferguson  methods;  and  the
selection of the ultimate loss derived from the various methods.

The  primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter  included  the  following.  We  tested  certain  internal  controls  over  the
Company’s  self-insurance  process.  Such  controls  included  controls  over  the  (a)  evaluation  of  claims  information  sent  to  the  actuary,  (b)
development  and  selection  of  the  key  assumptions  used  in  the  actuarial  calculation,  and  (c)  review  of  the  actuarial  report  and  evaluation  of  the
external  actuarial  expert’s  qualifications,  competency,  and  objectivity.  We  tested  the  claims  data  used  in  the  actuarial  calculation  by  selecting  a
sample and checking key attributes such as date of loss. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:

•
•
•

•

Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards;
Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual loss payments;
Evaluating the key assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance
liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company; and
Evaluating  the  qualifications  of  the  Company’s  actuaries  by  assessing  their  certifications,  and determining  whether  they  met  the  Qualification
Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render the statements of actuarial opinion implicit in their analyses.

Performance of incremental audit procedures over IT financial reporting processes

As  of  September  2,  2018,  the  Company  identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  general
controls (ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support the
Company’s financial reporting processes. Automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also
deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. While our report dated October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion
on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  September  1,  2019,  during  a  portion  of  the  52-week  period
ended September 1, 2019, the ITGCs were ineffective and the information or system generated reports produced by the affected financial reporting
systems  could  not  be  relied  upon  without  further  testing.  We  identified  the  performance  of  the  necessary  incremental  audit  procedures  over  the
financial information reliant on the impacted IT systems as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was required to design and execute
the incremental audit procedures and to assess the sufficiency of the procedures performed and evidence obtained due to ineffective controls and
the complexity of the Company’s IT environment.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills
and knowledge to assist in the identification and design of the incremental procedures. We modified the types of procedures that were performed,
which included:

•

Testing the underlying records of selected transaction data obtained from the impacted IT systems to support the use of the information in the
conduct of the audit; and

31

Table of Contents

•

Involving  forensic  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and  knowledge  in  data  analysis  to  perform  an  evaluation  of  the  journal  entry  data,
including assessing that the entire population of automated and manual transactions has been identified. Forensic professionals also assisted
with  the  identification  of  certain  entries  that  required  additional  testing  and  for  all  such  entries,  we  agreed  the  journal  entry  data  to  source
documents.

We evaluated the collective results of the incremental audit procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the
information produced by the impacted IT systems.

Evaluation of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, H.R. 1, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (2017 Tax Act) contains numerous provisions
impacting the computation of the Company’s U.S. federal and state corporate income tax provision, including the Global Intangible Low Tax Income
(GILTI), Foreign Derived Intangibles Income (FDII) and Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) provisions. For the year ended September 1, 2019, the Company
recognized net tax benefits of $123 million related to the 2017 Tax Act.

We  identified  the  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  2017  Tax  Act  as  a  critical  audit  matter.  A  high  degree  of
judgment was required to interpret the impact of the new tax law on the Company, especially given the complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and related
Treasury Regulations. Further, evaluating the Company’s application of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions of the 2017 Tax Act required complex
auditor judgment.

The  primary  procedures  we  performed  to  address  this  critical  audit  matter  included  the  following.  We  tested  certain  internal  controls  over  the
Company’s income tax process, including controls over the (a) identification and interpretation of the relevant provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and
related Treasury Regulations and (b) calculation of the impact of the GILTI, FDII and FTC provisions. We involved tax professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Act. They developed an independent
assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  GILTI,  FDII  and  FTC  provisions  based  on  our  understanding  and  interpretation,  and  compared  it  to  the  net  tax
benefits the Company recognized related to the 2017 Tax Act.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Costco Wholesale Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2019,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway  Commission.  In  our  opinion,  the  Company  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of
September  1,  2019,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  September  1,  2019  and  September  2,  2018,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income,
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the 52-week period ended September 1, 2019, the 52-week period ended September 2, 2018 and
the  53-week  period  ended  September  3,  2017,  and  the  related  notes  (collectively,  the  consolidated  financial  statements),  and  our  report  dated
October 10, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the
effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over
Financial Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a  reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A
company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the
company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

33

Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on
the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise
categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September 1, 2019, Costco operated 782 warehouses worldwide: 543 in

the United States (U.S.) located in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 100 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 26
in Japan, 16 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, 11 in Australia, two in Spain, and one each in Iceland, France and China. The Company operates e-commerce
websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling
interest. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All
material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Company’s  net  income  excludes  income  attributable  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  in  Taiwan.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  the  Company
purchased  its  former  joint-venture  partner's  remaining  equity  interest  in  its  Korean  operations.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  references  to  net  income
relate to net income attributable to Costco.

Fiscal Year End

The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2019 and 2018
relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 1, 2019, and September 2, 2018, respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal
year ended September 3, 2017.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the
date  of  purchase,  and  proceeds  due  from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  with  settlement  terms  of  up  to  four  days.  Credit  and  debit  card
receivables were $1,434 and $1,348 at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Company provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as payments are presented. Included in accounts payable at the end of
2019 and 2018 are $673 and $463, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding payments over cash on deposit at the banks on which the
payments were drawn.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

39

Table of Contents

Short-Term Investments

In general, short-term investments have a maturity at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five
years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the
specific  identification  method  with  the  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  until  realized.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in
interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  Short-term  investments  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  financial
instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured
to fair value on a recurring basis.

The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment, using both qualitative and
quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income
and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3,
and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt, respectively.

Fair  value  is  defined  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable
inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, such as
quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other
non-derivative  financial  instruments  are  based  on  independent  external  valuation  information.  The  pricing  process  uses  data  from  a  variety  of
independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including
but not limited to treasury benchmarks and Libor and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable,
using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.

Current  financial  liabilities  have  fair  values  that  approximate  their  carrying  values.  Long-term  financial  liabilities  include  the  Company's  long-term
debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs, and
are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on
reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.

Table of Contents

Receivables, Net

Receivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include
volume  rebates  or  other  discounts.  Balances  are  generally  presented  on  a  gross  basis,  separate  from  any  related  payable  due.  In  certain
circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net
basis.  Reinsurance  receivables  are  held  by  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  and  primarily  represent  amounts  ceded
through  reinsurance  arrangements  gross  of  the  amounts  assumed  under  reinsurance,  which  are  presented  within  other  current  liabilities  in  the
consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in
the U.S. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts
due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.

Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on historical experience and application of the specific
identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial in 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Merchandise Inventories

Merchandise inventories consist of the following:

$

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching
current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or
deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have
been determined.  As of September 1, 2019 and  September 2, 2018,  U.S.  merchandise  inventories  valued  at  LIFO  approximated  first-in,  first-out
(FIFO) after considering the lower of cost or market principle. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued
using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the FIFO basis.

The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on
the Company’s experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth
fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards
earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable.

Property and Equipment

Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  In  general,  new  building  additions  are  classified  into  components,  each  with  an  estimated  useful  life,
generally five to  fifty years  for  buildings  and  improvements  and  three to  twenty years  for  equipment  and  fixtures.  Depreciation  and  amortization
expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements made after the
beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease
plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are made.

The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use.
During development, these costs are included in construction in

41

Table of Contents

progress.  When  the  assets  are  ready  for  their  intended  use,  these  costs  are  included  in  equipment  and  fixtures  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally three to seven years.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change
the  way  an  asset  functions  or  that  extend  the  useful  life  are  capitalized.  Assets  removed  during  the  remodel,  refurbishment  or  improvement  are
retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.

The Company  evaluates long-lived assets  for  impairment  on an annual basis, when relocating  or closing a facility,  or when events or  changes in
circumstances  may  indicate  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  group,  generally  an  individual  warehouse,  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  For  asset
groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated
future  undiscounted  cash  flows  generated  from  the  use  and  eventual  disposition  of  the  asset  group  exceed  the  respective  carrying  value.  In  the
event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the
excess  of  the  carrying  value  above  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  asset  group.  For  asset  groups  classified  as  held-for-sale  (disposal  group),  the
carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals
from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. There were no impairment charges recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Insurance/Self-insurance Liabilities

The Company is predominantly self-insured for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’
and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. Insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit exposures arising from very
large losses. It uses different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in
a  reinsurance  program.  Liabilities  associated  with  the  risks  that  are  retained  by  the  Company  are  not  discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  by
considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these
liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2019 and
2018,  these  insurance  liabilities  were  $1,222 and  $ 1,148 in  the  aggregate,  respectively,  and  were  included  in  accrued  salaries  and  benefits  and
other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.

The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in
the  consolidated  statements  of  income.  The  captive  participates  in  a  reinsurance  program  that  includes  other  third-party  participants.  The
reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of
the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income
statement  adjustments  related  to  the  reinsurance  program  and related  impacts  to  the  consolidated  balance sheets  are  recognized  as  information
becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior
activity.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign-currency  exchange-rate  fluctuations  in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations,  in part,
through  the  use  of  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts,  seeking  to  economically  hedge  the  impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known
future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreign-currency.  The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory
expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do
not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in
speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding

42

Table of Contents

contracts upon certain triggering events. At the end of 2019 and  2018, the aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability
position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial.
The  aggregate  notional  amounts  of  open,  unsettled  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $704 and  $ 717 at  the  end  of  2019 and  2018,
respectively. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2019 and 2018.

The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to the
net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2019, 2018, and 2017.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and
manufacturing  operations,  which  it  seeks  to  partially  mitigate  through  the  use  of  fixed-price  contracts  for  certain  of  its  warehouses  and  other
facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to
fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal
purchases or normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.

Foreign Currency

The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets
and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in
accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company’s  consolidated  foreign  operations  are  translated  at  average
exchange rates prevailing during the year.

The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Generally,
these  include  the  U.S.  dollar  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  the  U.S.  dollar  payables  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  revalued  to  their  functional
currency.  Also  included  are  realized  foreign-currency  gains  or  losses  from  settlements  of  forward  foreign-exchange  contracts.  These  items  were
immaterial for 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable,
and  is  net  of  sales  taxes  collected  and  remitted  to  government  agencies  and  returns.  The  Company  reserves  for  estimated  returns  based  on
historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund
liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance
sheets.

Merchandise Sales -  The Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and
fresh  foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses.  The  majority  of
revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is recognized upon
shipment to the member to the extent there is no installation provided as a part of the contract. For merchandise shipped directly to the member,
shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in  merchandise  costs  in  the  consolidated  statements  of
income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included
in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Principal Versus Agent - The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is
the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally is established when Costco is
primarily responsible

43

Table of Contents

for merchandising decisions, maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction, and has pricing
discretion.

Membership Fees - The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership
period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $1,711 and $1,624, respectively.

In certain countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum of approximately $1,000
per year), which does not expire and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales,
net  of  the  estimated  impact  of  non-redemptions  (breakage),  with  the  corresponding  liability  classified  as  accrued  member  rewards  in  the
consolidated  balance  sheets.  Estimated  breakage  is  computed  based  on  redemption  data.  For  2019,  2018 and 2017,  the  net  reduction  in sales
was $1,537, $1,394, and $1,281 respectively.

Shop Cards - The Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online
for  merchandise  or  membership.  Revenue  from  shop  cards  is  recognized  upon  redemption,  and  estimated  breakage  is  recognized  based  on
redemption  data.  The  Company  accounts  for  outstanding  shop  card  balances  as  a  shop  card  liability,  net  of  estimated  breakage.  Previously,  the
shop cards were branded as cash cards.

Co-Branded  Credit  Card  Program  -  Citibank,  N.A.  (“Citi”)  became  the  exclusive  issuer  of  co-branded  credit  cards  to  U.S.  members  in  June
2016.  The  Company  receives  various  forms  of  consideration,  including  a  royalty  on  purchases  made  on  the  card  outside  of  Costco,  a  portion  of
which, after giving rise to estimated breakage, is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive. The rebates are issued in February and expire on
December 31. Breakage is estimated based on redemption data.

Merchandise Costs

Merchandise  costs  consist  of  the  purchase  price  or  manufacturing  costs  of  inventory  sold,  inbound  and  outbound  shipping  charges  and  all  costs
related  to  the  Company’s  depot  and  fulfillment  operations,  including  freight  from  depots  to  selling  warehouses,  and  are  reduced  by  vendor
consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods and certain ancillary departments.

Vendor Consideration

The  Company  has  agreements  to  receive  funds  from  vendors  for  discounts  and  a  variety  of  other  programs.  These  programs  are  evidenced  by
signed agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate
or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction
of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by another systematic approach.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries,  benefits  and  workers’  compensation  costs  for  warehouse  employees
(other  than  fresh  foods  departments  and  certain  ancillary  businesses  which  are  reflected  in merchandise  costs)  as  well as  all regional  and home
office  employees,  including  buying  personnel.  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  also  include  substantially  all  building  and  equipment
depreciation,  stock  compensation  expense,  credit  and  debit  card  processing  fees,  utilities,  as  well  as  other  operating  costs  incurred  to  support
warehouse and e-commerce website operations.

Retirement Plans

The Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan
allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible
participant  an  annual  discretionary  contribution.  The  Company  also  has  a  defined  contribution  plan  for  Canadian  employees  and  contributes  a
percentage  of  each  employee's  wages.  Certain  subsidiaries  in  the  Company's  Other  International  operations  have  defined  benefit  and  defined
contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $614, $578, and $543 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and
are predominantly included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation

Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees generally vest over five years and allow for quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-
based  awards  that  would  vest  on the  next  anniversary  of  the  grant  date  in the  event  of  retirement  or  voluntary  termination.  Actual  forfeitures  are
recognized as they occur.

Compensation expense for stock-based awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the
entire  award.  Awards  for  employees  and  non-employee  directors  provide  for  accelerated  vesting  of  a  portion  of  outstanding  shares  based  on
cumulative  years  of  service  with  the  Company.  Compensation  expense  for  the  accelerated  shares  is  recognized  upon  achievement  of  the  long-
service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of
the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less
the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.

Stock-based  compensation  expense  is  predominantly  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of
income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See Note 7 for additional information on the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Leases

The  Company  leases  land  and/or  buildings  at  warehouses  and  certain  other  office  and  distribution  facilities,  primarily  under  operating  leases.
Operating leases expire at various dates through 2068, with the exception of one lease in the U.K., which expires in 2151. These leases generally
contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal for a defined number
of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or
(c) right of first refusal in the event of a third-party purchase offer.

The  Company  accounts  for  its  lease  expense  with  free  rent  periods  and  step-rent  provisions  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  original  term  of  the
lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property.
Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices, or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.

The Company has capital leases for certain warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2059. Capital lease assets are included in land
and buildings  and improvements  in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Amortization  expense  on capital  lease  assets  is  recorded  as
depreciation  expense  and  is  included  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses.  Capital  lease  liabilities  are  recorded  at  the  lesser  of  the
estimated  fair market  value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included in
other  current  liabilities  and  other  liabilities  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Interest  on  these  obligations  is  included  in  interest
expense in the consolidated statements of income.

45

Table of Contents

The Company records an asset and related financing obligation for the estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements where it
is  considered  the  owner  for  accounting  purposes,  to  the  extent  the  Company  is  involved  in  the  construction  of  the  building  or  structural
improvements or has construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy, the Company assesses whether these arrangements
qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the Company continues to be the deemed owner, it accounts for the
arrangement as a financing lease.

The Company’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that at the end of a lease must be removed. These
obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term based upon the estimated fair
value  of  the  costs  to  remove  the  improvements.  These  liabilities  are  accreted  over  time  to  the  projected  future  value  of  the  obligation.  The  ARO
assets  are  depreciated  using  the  same  depreciation  method  as  the  leasehold  improvement  assets  and  are  included  with  buildings  and
improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases were immaterial at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included
in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening expenses include costs for startup operations related to new warehouses and relocations, developments in new international markets,
new manufacturing and distribution facilities, and expansions at existing warehouses and are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized  in  income  in  the  period  that  includes  the  enactment  date.  A  valuation  allowance  is
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.

The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The
benefits  of  uncertain  tax  positions  are  recorded  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  only  after  determining  a  more-likely-than-not
probability  that  the  uncertain  tax  positions  will  withstand  challenge  from  tax  authorities.  When  facts  and  circumstances  change,  the  Company
reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.

Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco

The  computation  of  basic  net  income  per  share  uses  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  that  were  outstanding  during  the  period.  The
computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the
number  of  common  shares  that  would  be  issued  assuming  vesting  of  all  potentially  dilutive  common  shares  outstanding  using  the  treasury  stock
method for shares subject to RSUs.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Repurchased  shares  of  common  stock  are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.  The  par  value  of  repurchased
shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and
retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is
applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, providing for changes in the
recognition  of  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers.  The  guidance  requires  disclosures  sufficient  to  describe  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective approach,
and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $16 as an increase to retained earnings, which is included in cash dividend declared and other in the
consolidated statements of equity.

The  standard  impacted  the  presentation  and  timing  of  certain  revenue  transactions.  Specifically,  the  changes  included  gross  presentation  of  the
Company’s  estimate  of  merchandise  returns  reserve  and  the  related  recoverable  assets,  recognizing  shop  card  breakage  over  the  period  of
redemption,  and  accelerating  the  recognition  of  certain  e-commerce  and  special-order  sales.  Additionally,  the  Company’s  evaluation  under  the
standard of its status as a principal in certain revenue arrangements resulted in the recognition of additional sales on a gross basis.

The  effect  of  the  standard  on  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheet  was  an  increase  to  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assets
of  $649 and  $698 at  adoption  and  at  the  end  of  2019,  respectively,  related  to  the  estimate  of  merchandise  returns  reserve  and  the  related
recoverable assets.

The effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company's consolidated statement of income is as follows:

52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2019

Net Sales

Merchandise Costs
Gross Margin (1)
______________

(1) Net sales less merchandise costs.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires recognition on the balance sheet of rights and obligations created by leases with
terms  greater  than  twelve  months.  The  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  and interim  periods  within  those  years  beginning after  December  15,
2018,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  The  Company  plans  to  adopt  this  guidance  at  the  beginning  of  its  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020  and  utilize  the
transition  option,  which  allows  for  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  in  the  period  of  adoption  and  does  not  require  application  of  the  guidance  to
comparative periods. The primary effect of adoption will be recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating
leases.  The  Company  has  substantially  completed  its  assessment  of  the  new  standard  and  estimates  total  assets  and  liabilities  will  increase  by
approximately $2,400 upon adoption. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated statements of income
or cash flows. The Company continues to evaluate the related disclosure requirements.

Note 4—Debt

Short-Term Borrowings

The  Company  maintains  various  short-term  bank  credit  facilities,  with  a  borrowing  capacity  of  $865 and  $857,  in  2019 and  2018,  respectively.
Borrowings on these short-term facilities were immaterial during 2019 and 2018, and there were no outstanding borrowings at the end of 2019 and
2018.

Long-Term Debt

The  Company's  long-term  debt  consists  primarily  of  Senior  Notes,  which  have  various  principal  balances,  interest  rates,  and  maturity  dates  as
described  below.  The  Company  at  its  option  may  redeem  the  Senior  Notes  at  any  time,  in  whole  or  in  part,  at  a  redemption  price  plus  accrued
interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled
payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, as defined by the terms of the Senior Notes, the holder has the right
to  require  the  Company  to  purchase  this  security  at  a  price  of  101% of  the  principal  amount  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  to  the  date  of  the
event. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.

Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary and are valued using Level 3 inputs. In
October 2018, the Company's Japanese subsidiary repaid a Guaranteed Senior Note and in August 2019, issued approximately $200 and $100 of
Guaranteed Senior Notes at fixed interest rates of 0.28% and 0.42%, respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually, and principal is due in August
2029 and August 2034, respectively.

At the end of 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $6,997 and $6,492,
respectively. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:

1.70% Senior Notes due December 2019

1.75% Senior Notes due February 2020

2.15% Senior Notes due May 2021

2.25% Senior Notes due February 2022

Note 6—Stockholders’ Equity

Dividends

The Company’s current quarterly dividend rate is $0.65 per share. In August 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the
amount of $0.65 per share, which was paid subsequent to the end of 2019.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In  April  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  new  share  repurchase  program  in  the  amount  of  $4,000,  which  expires  in  April  2023.  This
authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,237. As of the end of 2019, the remaining amount available for stock
repurchases under the approved plan was $3,943. The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity:

Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The  Company  grants  stock-based  compensation,  primarily  to  employees  and  non-employee  directors.  Grants  to  all  executive  officers  are
performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by
the Company. RSUs are subject to quarterly vesting upon retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with
the  Company  receive  shares  under  accelerated  vesting  provisions  on  the  annual  vesting  date.  On  January  24,  2019,  shareholders  approved  the
adoption  of  the  2019  Incentive  Plan,  which  replaced  the  Seventh  Restated  2002  Stock  Incentive  Plan  (Seventh  Plan).  The  2019  Incentive  Plan
authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available
for grant under the Seventh Plan on January 24, 2019 and future forfeited shares from grants under the Seventh Plan up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are
generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.

Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity

RSUs  granted  to  employees  and  to  non-employee  directors  generally  vest  over  five and  three years,  respectively.  Additionally,  the  terms  of  the
RSUs,  including  performance-based  awards,  provide  for  accelerated  vesting  for  employees  and  non-employee  directors  who  have  attained  25 or
more and five or more years of service with the Company, respectively. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on non-vested and
undelivered shares. At the end of 2019, 15,676,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs under the 2019 Incentive Plan.

In December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. Except for certain provisions, the 2017 Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or
after January 1, 2018. The Company is a fiscal-year taxpayer, so most provisions became effective for 2019, including limitations on the Company’s
ability to claim foreign tax credits, repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, and limitations on certain business deductions. Provisions with
significant impacts that were effective starting in the second quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 included: a decrease in the U.S. federal income
tax rate, remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities, and a transition tax on deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The decrease
in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to 21.0% was effective for all of 2019 and resulted in a blended rate for the Company of 25.6% for 2018.

The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate is as follows:

During  2019,  the  Company  recognized  net  tax  benefits  of  $123 related  to  the  2017  Tax  Act.  This  benefit  primarily  included  $105 related  to  U.S.
taxation of deemed foreign dividends, partially offset by losses of current year foreign tax credits. During 2018, the Company recognized a net tax
expense  of  $19 related  to  the  2017  Tax  Act.  This  expense  included  $142 for  the  estimated  tax  on  deemed  repatriation  of  foreign  earnings,
and $43 for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a tax benefit of  $166 for the remeasurement of certain
deferred tax liabilities.

Table of Contents

In 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized total net tax benefits of $221 and $57, which included a benefit of $59 and $33, respectively, related to
the  stock-based  compensation  accounting  standard  adopted  in  2018  in  addition  to  the  impacts  of  the  2017  Tax  Act  noted  above.  In  2017,  the
Company’s  provision  for  income  taxes  was  favorably  impacted  by  a  net  tax  benefit  of  $104,  primarily  due  to  the  $82 tax  benefit  recorded  in
connection with the May 2017 special cash dividends paid by the Company to employees through the Company's 401(k) retirement plan. Dividends
on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. There was no similar special cash dividend in 2019 or 2018.

The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2019 and 2018 include deferred income tax assets of $398 and $316, respectively, included in other assets;
and deferred income tax liabilities of $543 and $317, respectively, included in other liabilities.

In  2019,  the  Company  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of  $76 primarily  related  to  foreign  tax  credits  that  we  believe  will  not  be  realized  due  to
limitations  on  the  Company's  ability  to  claim  the  credits  during  the  carry  forward  period.  The  foreign  tax  credit  carry  forwards  are  set  to  expire
beginning in fiscal 2027.

The Company  no longer considers  fiscal  year  earnings  of our non-U.S.  consolidated  subsidiaries  after  2017 to be indefinitely  reinvested  and has
recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) on fiscal year earnings and state income taxes payable
assuming  a  hypothetical  repatriation  to  the  U.S.  The  Company  continues  to  consider  undistributed  earnings  of  certain  non-U.S.  consolidated
subsidiaries prior to 2018, which totaled $2,924, to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing
of such deductibility. At the end of 2019 and  2018, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than
interest  and  penalties,  the  disallowance  of  these  tax  positions  would  not  affect  the  annual  effective  tax  rate  but  would  accelerate  the  payment  of
cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax
rate in future periods is $24 and $32 at the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  income  tax  matters  are  classified  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense.  Interest  and  penalties
recognized during 2019 and 2018 and accrued at the end of each respective period were not material.

The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the
next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with
the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in
the next 12 months.

The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions.
With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2014.

Other Taxes

The  Company  is  undergoing  multiple  examinations  for  value  added,  sales-based,  payroll,  product,  import  or  other  non-income  taxes  in  various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Subsequent to the end of 2019, the Company received
an assessment  related  to a product tax  audit covering  multiple years.  The Company  recorded a charge of  $123 in 2019, but plans to protest the
assessment. Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible
loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could
result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

The  Company  is  involved  in  a  number  of  claims,  proceedings  and  litigation  arising  from  its  business  and property  ownership.  In  accordance  with
applicable  accounting  guidance,  the  Company  establishes  an  accrual  for  legal  proceedings  if  and  when  those  matters  reach  a  stage  where  they
present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The
Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification
arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. As of the date of
this Report, the Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals
for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an
accrual,  but  will  continue  to  monitor  the  matter  for  developments  that  will  make  the  loss  contingency  both  probable  and  reasonably  estimable.  In
each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no
accrual  has  been  recorded,  the  possible  loss  or  range  of  loss  (including  any  loss  in  excess  of  the  accrual)  cannot,  in  the  Company's  view,  be

reasonably estimated because, among other things: (i) the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; (ii) the legal and/or factual
theories are not well developed; and/or (iii) the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.

The Company is a defendant in a class action alleging violation of California Wage Order 7-2001 for failing to provide seating to member service
assistants who act as greeters in the Company’s California warehouses. Canela v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al. (Case No. 5:13-CV-03598, N.D.
Cal. filed July 1, 2013). The complaint seeks relief under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. The Company filed
an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. The action has been stayed pending review by the Ninth Circuit of the order certifying a
class.  In  January  2019,  an  employee  brought  similar  claims  for  relief  concerning  Costco  employees  engaged  at  member  services  counters  in
California.  Rodriguez  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  RG19001310,  Alameda  Superior  Court  filed  Jan.  4,  2019).  The  Company  filed  an
answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. In December 2018, a depot employee raised similar claims, alleging that depot employees
in California did not receive suitable seating or appropriate workplace temperature conditions. Lane v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Dec. 6, 2018 Notice
to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency). The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint.

Corp.,  et  al. (Case  No.  2:19-cv-03454  C.D.  Cal.  Filed  Mar.  25,  2019).  The  Company  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material  allegations  of  the
complaint.  In  May  2019,  employees  filed  a  class  action  against  the  Company  alleging  claims  under  California  law  for  failure  to  pay  overtime,  to
provide itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay minimum wages, and for unfair business practices.
Rough  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  2:19-cv-01340  E.D.  Cal.  filed  May  28,  2019).  Relief  is  sought  under  the  California  Labor  Code,
including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In June 2019, employees filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law
for failure to pay overtime, to provide meal and rest periods, itemized wage statements, to timely pay wages due to terminating employees, to pay
minimum wages, and for unfair business practices. Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp., (Case No. 3:19-cv-05624 (N.D. Cal. filed June 11, 2019).
The  Company  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material  allegations  of  the  complaint.  In  August  2019,  Rough  filed  a  companion  case  in  state  court
seeking  penalties  under  the  California  Labor  Code  Private  Attorneys  General  Act.  Rough  v.  Costco (Case  No.  FCS053454,  Sonoma  County
Superior Court, filed August 23, 2019). Relief is sought under the California Labor Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees. In September
2019, an employee re-filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay wages, to provide meal and
rest  periods  and  itemized  wage  statements,  to  timely  pay  wages  due  to  terminating  employees,  to  pay  minimum  wages,  and  for  unfair  business
practices. Mosley v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:19-cv-07935, C.D. Cal. filed Sept. 12, 2019). Relief is sought under the California Labor
Code, including civil penalties and attorneys' fees.

In  December  2017,  the  United  States  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  numerous  cases  filed  against  various  defendants  by
counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, and third-party payors concerning the impacts of opioid abuse. In re National Prescription Opiate
Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are federal cases that name the Company, including actions filed by counties and cities in Michigan,
New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and class actions filed in thirty-eight states on behalf of infants born
with opioid-related  medical conditions.  In 2019 similar actions were commenced against the Company in state courts in Utah. Claims against the
Company in state courts in New Jersey and Oklahoma have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of these matters.

The  Company  and  its  CEO  and  CFO  are  defendants  in  putative  class  actions  brought  on  behalf  of  shareholders  who  acquired  Company  stock
between  June  6  and  October  25,  2018.  Johnson  v.  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.,  et  al. (W.D.  Wash.  filed  Nov.  5,  2018); Chen  v.  Costco  Wholesale
Corp.,  et  al.  (W.D.  Wash.  filed  Dec.  11,  2018).    The  complaints  allege  violations  of  the  federal  securities  laws  stemming  from  the  Company’s
disclosures concerning internal control over financial reporting.  They seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, and costs and attorneys’
fees.  On January 30, 2019, an order was entered consolidating the actions and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 16, 2019. A
motion to dismiss the complaint was filed on June 7.

Members of the Board of Directors, one other individual, and the Company are defendants in a shareholder derivative action related to the internal
controls  and  related  disclosures  identified  in  the  putative  class  actions,  alleging  that  the  individual  defendants  breached  their  fiduciary
duties.  Wedekind  v.  Hamilton  James,  Susan  Decker,  Kenneth  Denman,  Richard  Galanti,  Craig  Jelinek,  Richard  Libenson,  John  Meisenbach,
Charles  Munger,  Jeffrey  Raikes,  John  Stanton,  Mary  Agnes  Wilderotter,  and  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (W.D.  Wash.  filed  Dec.  11,  2018).  The
complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of compensation, corporate governance changes, and costs and attorneys' fees.  Because the
complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company, which is a nominal defendant. By agreement among the
parties  the  action  has  been  stayed  pending  further  proceedings  in  the  class  actions.  Similar  actions  were  filed  in  King  County  Superior  Court  on
February 20, 2019, Elliott v. Hamilton James, Susan Decker, Kenneth Denman, Richard Galanti, Craig Jelinek, Richard Libenson, John Meisenbach,
Charles Munger, Jeffrey Raikes, John Stanton, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 19-2-04824-7), and April 16, 2019,

Jeffrey  Raikes,  John  Stanton,  Mary  Agnes  Wilderotter,  and  Costco  Wholesale  Corp.  (Case  No.  19-2-10460-1).  These  actions  have  also  been
stayed.

In November 2016 and September 2017, the Company received notices of violation from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection  regarding  hazardous  waste  practices  at  its  Connecticut  warehouses,  primarily  concerning  unsalable  pharmaceuticals.  The  relief  to  be
sought  is  not  known  at  this  time.  The  Company  is  seeking  to  cooperate  concerning  the  resolution  of  these  notices.  On  February  13,  2019,  the
Company's affiliate in Spain received notice from the General Directorate on Environment and Sustainability of the Regional Government of Madrid
that the Directorate was investigating issues concerning rain, sewage and hydrocarbon drainage related to the Company's warehouse in Getafe. In
August the Company was advised that no fines would be sought in this matter.

The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the
matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.

Note 11—Segment Reporting

The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Japan,
Korea, Australia, Spain, Iceland, France, and China and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Reportable segments are largely based on
management’s  organization  of  the  operating  segments  for  operational  decisions  and  assessments  of  financial  performance,  which  considers
geographic  locations.  The  material  accounting  policies  of  the  segments  are  as  described  in  Note 1.  Inter-segment  net  sales  and  expenses  have
been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income. Certain operating expenses, predominantly stock-based compensation, incurred
on behalf of the Company's Canadian and Other International operations, are included in the U.S. operations because those costs generally come
under the responsibility of U.S. management.

Item 9—Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to
allow  timely  decisions  regarding  disclosure.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  (CFO),  with  assistance  from  other
members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 1, 2019 and, based on their
evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the  Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP  and  includes  those  policies  and
procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions
of  our  assets;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  our  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  our  receipts  and  expenditures  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with
appropriate  authorizations;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of September 1, 2019, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013).

As disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 2, 2018, during the
fourth quarter  of  fiscal  2018 we  identified  a  material  weakness  in  internal  control  related  to  ineffective  information  technology  general  controls
(ITGCs) in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology (IT) systems that support the Company’s
financial reporting processes.

During 2019, management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included: (i) creating and filling an IT Compliance Oversight
function;  (ii)  developing  a  training  program  addressing  ITGCs  and  policies,  including  educating  control  owners  concerning  the  principles  and
requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change-management over IT systems impacting financial reporting;
(iii)  developing  and  maintaining  documentation  underlying  ITGCs  to  promote  knowledge  transfer  upon  personnel  and  function  changes;  (iv)
developing enhanced risk assessment procedures and controls related to changes in IT systems; (v) implementing an IT management review and
testing plan to monitor

62

Table of Contents

ITGCs  with  a  specific  focus  on  systems  supporting  our  financial  reporting  processes;  and  (vi)  enhanced  quarterly  reporting  on  the  remediation
measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

During  the  fourth quarter  of  2019,  we  completed  our  testing  of  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the  implemented  controls  and  found  them  to  be
effective. As a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of September 1, 2019.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Except for the changes in connection with our implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, there have been no other changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the  fourth quarter of
2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
