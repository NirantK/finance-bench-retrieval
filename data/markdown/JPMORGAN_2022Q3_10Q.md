Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third
quarter of 2022 versus the third quarter of 2021, unless
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
For the third quarter of 2022, JPMorgan Chase reported net
income of $9.7 billion, down 17%, earnings per share of
$3.12, an ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 18%.

Total net revenue was up 10%, and reflected:

• Net interest income of $17.5 billion, up 34%, driven by

higher rates, partially offset by lower Markets net interest
income. Net interest income excluding Markets was
$16.9 billion, up 51%.

• Noninterest revenue was $15.2 billion, down 8%, driven

by

– lower Investment Banking fees,

– $959 million of net investment securities losses in

Corporate, and

– lower net production revenue in Home Lending,

largely offset by
– higher CIB Markets revenue.

Noninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 12%, driven by
higher structural expense and continued investments in the
business, including compensation, technology and
marketing.

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, reflecting:

• a net addition of $808 million to the allowance for credit
losses, consisting of a net addition of $937 million in
wholesale, driven by loan growth and lending-related
commitment activity, as well as the impact of updates to
the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by a
net reduction of $143 million in consumer, driven by
Home Lending, and

• $727 million of net charge-offs, up $203 million,

predominantly driven by CCB.

5

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $1.5 billion,
reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses
of $2.1 billion and net charge-offs of $524 million.

The total allowance for credit losses was $20.8 billion at
September 30, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.70%, compared
with 1.86% in the prior year.

The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at
September 30, 2022, a net decrease of $1.6 billion from
the prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting
loan sales and improved credit performance in consumer,
and paydowns in wholesale.

Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 7%, driven
by higher loans across the lines of business.

Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 3%,
reflecting an increase in CCB driven by growth from new
and existing accounts across both consumer and small
business customers, and growth in time deposits in AWM,
partially offset by declines in both Payments and Securities
Services in CIB and in non-operating deposits in CB.

Selected capital and other metrics
The Firm’s CET1 capital was $210 billion, and the
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.5% and
13.0%, respectively.

The Firm’s SLR was 5.3%.

The Firm's TBVPS was $69.90, relatively flat versus the
prior year.

As of September 30, 2022, the Firm had average eligible
High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately
$716 billion and unencumbered marketable securities
with a fair value of approximately $771 billion, resulting in
approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for additional
information.

Refer to Consolidated Result of Operations and
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-15 and
pages 16-17, respectively, for a further discussion of the
Firm's results.

Recent events
On September 12, 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that it
had signed an agreement to acquire Renovite Technologies,
Inc. (“Renovite”), a cloud-native payments technology
company.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q,
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to
Forward-Looking Statements on page 89 and page 155 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors
that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ
materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is
no assurance that actual results will be in line with the
outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the fourth quarter of
2022 and full-year 2022 should be viewed against the
backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial
markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the
competitive environment, client and customer activity
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business.
Each of these factors will affect the performance of the
Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate
adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to
ongoing developments in the business, economic,
regulatory and legal environments in which it operates.

Fourth quarter and full-year 2022
Management expects net interest income to be
approximately $19 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022,
which would result in approximately $66 billion for full-year
2022, market dependent.

Management expects net interest income excluding Markets
to also be approximately $19 billion in the fourth quarter of
2022, with Markets NII expected to be around zero, which
would result in approximately $61.5 billion for full-year
2022, market dependent.

Management expects full-year 2022 adjusted expense to be
approximately $77 billion, which includes increased
investments in technology, distribution and marketing, and
higher structural expense.

Management expects the full-year 2022 net charge-off rate
in Card to be approximately 1.5%.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to
make progress with respect to the transition from the use of
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of
Securities Commission's standards for transaction-based
benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the
principal tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight,
one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR)
is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

The Firm continues its client outreach with respect to U.S.
dollar LIBOR-linked loans and continues to monitor and
evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative
developments. Refer to Business Developments on pages
50-51 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Business Developments
War in Ukraine
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine
remain uncertain. The Firm has taken steps to close
positions and reduce exposures connected with the war,
and continues to assist clients with fulfilling or terminating
pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related
risks.

The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients
and counterparties is not material to its financial condition
or results of operations. However, the secondary impacts of
the war in Ukraine, including increased market volatility,
inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and
economic sanctions imposed by various governments, could
have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses.

The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the
operational risks associated with the war, including
compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and
the increased risk of cyber attacks.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 64-72,
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75, Market Risk
Management on pages 77-81, Country Risk Management on
pages 82-83 and Operational Risk Management on page 84
for additional information.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, “Russia” refers to exposure
to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the
largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest
proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on
the Firm’s internal country risk management framework;
and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic
or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have
been imposed or which have close association with Russia.

and $3.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile

market conditions continued to have a negative impact on
issuance activity, and

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced

deals.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28-33 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased primarily in CIB,
reflecting:

• higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, as elevated
volatility drove a strong performance in the macro
businesses, particularly Rates and Currencies & Emerging
Markets, and

• higher revenue associated with Derivatives in Equity

Markets.

Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $31 million,
compared with a gain of $108 million in the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB results on pages 28-33, and Note 5 for
additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a result of
lower cash management fees on higher credits earned by
clients, in CB and CIB. Refer to CIB and CB segment results
on pages 28-33, pages 34-37 and Note 5 for additional
information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue decreased, reflecting:

• lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from
lower average market levels, largely offset by the
removal of most money market fund fee waivers,

• lower brokerage commissions largely in AWM reflecting

reduced volumes, and

• lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets under

custody reflecting lower market levels,

partially offset by

• higher travel-related commissions in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages
23-27, pages 28-33 and pages 38-41 and Note 5 for
additional information.
Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 42-43 and Note 9 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and

volume,

partially offset by
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain
in MSR risk management, compared with a net loss in the
prior year driven by updates to model inputs.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27 and Notes 5
and 14 for additional information.

10

Card income increased, reflecting higher revenue on
volume growth in commercial card and merchant
processing in CIB and CB.

Card income in CCB was relatively flat as the impact from
the increase in debit and credit card sales volume was
offset by higher amortization related to new account
origination costs. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results
on pages 23-27, pages 28-33 and pages 34-37 and Note 5
for additional information.

Other income decreased reflecting:

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a

decline in volume, and

• net losses on equity investments in CIB, compared with a

gain in the prior year,

partially offset by

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates

related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO,
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar.

Refer to Note 4 for additional information on net
investment hedges.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates,
partially offset by lower Markets NII.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, up $125 billion, and the yield was 3.05%, up 125
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an
FTE basis, was 2.09%, an increase of 47 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 2.81%, up 90 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest
and rates schedule on page 182 for further information.
Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20
for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity and debt underwriting fees as volatile

market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity, and

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced

deals.

Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting:

• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a
strong performance in the macro businesses, particularly
Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset
by lower revenue in Securitized Products and Credit, and

• higher revenue associated with Derivatives and Prime

Brokerage in Equity Markets,

largely offset by

• a loss of $773 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in
CIB, compared with a gain of $338 million in the prior
year. The loss in the current year reflected funding
spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on
exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-
associated counterparties,

• net markdowns predominantly recorded in the second
quarter of 2022 on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio
in CIB and CB,

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year, and

• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment
transactions, which were more than offset by the related
net interest income earned on these transactions.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher
service fee volume in CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on
pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased, predominantly driven by:

• higher travel-related commissions in CCB,

• higher asset management fees, including in AWM due to
the removal of most money market fund fee waivers and
net inflows, largely offset by lower market levels and

• higher annuity sales in CCB,

partially offset by

• lower administration fees in CIB on reduced assets under

custody reflecting lower market levels.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S.
Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolios in Treasury and CIO.

11

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and
balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII,
as well as lower NII from PPP loans.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4
trillion, up $203 billion, and the yield was 2.38%, up 56
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an
FTE basis, was 1.85%, an increase of 21 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 2.34%, up 42 bps.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and

volume,

largely offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue resulting from

– a net gain in MSR risk management, compared with a
net loss in the prior year driven by updates to model
inputs, and

– higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-

party loans serviced.

Card income decreased due to higher amortization related
to new account origination costs in Card, partially offset by
higher revenue on volume growth in commercial card and
merchant processing in CIB and CB.

Other income decreased reflecting:

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a

decline in volume,

• net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM,

compared with net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first

quarter of 2022 in Corporate,

• higher net gains related to certain other Corporate

investments,

• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial

satisfaction of a loan in CB, and

• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in
the prior year on certain renewable energy investments
in CIB.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, reflecting a
net addition of $808 million to the allowance for credit
losses and $727 million of net charge-offs. The net addition
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:

Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses was $4.1 billion, reflecting a
net addition of $2.1 billion to the allowance for credit
losses and $2.0 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:

• $937 million in wholesale, driven by loan growth and
lending-related commitment activity, as well as the
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios,

partially offset by

• a net reduction of $143 million in consumer, driven by

Home Lending.

The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the
addition to the allowance resulting from higher outstanding
balances was offset by a reduction related to a decrease in
uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the
effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

Net charge-offs increased $203 million, predominantly
driven by CCB.

The prior year included a $2.1 billion net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $524
million.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23-27, CIB on pages
28-33, CB on pages 34-37, AWM on pages 38-41,
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75, and Notes 9
and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio
and the allowance for credit losses.

• $1.9 billion in wholesale, driven by

– loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast,

including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios
and the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022;
• $168 million in consumer, primarily driven by Card,

reflecting higher outstanding balances, predominantly
offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

Net charge-offs decreased $349 million driven by Card,
reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers.
However, median deposit balances continue to decline,
impacted by the growth in consumer spending.

The prior year included a $10.3 billion net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $2.3
billion.

Quarterly results
Compensation expense increased driven by higher
structural expense and investments in the business, as well
as higher revenue-related expense in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher investments in the business, including marketing

in CCB, and technology, and

• higher structural expense, including travel and
entertainment and regulatory assessments,

partially offset by

• lower volume-related expense, primarily depreciation

expense in CCB on lower auto lease assets.

Year-to-date results
Compensation expense increased driven by higher
structural expense and investments in the business,
partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation in
CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher investments in the business, including marketing

in CCB, and technology, and

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits and loan
growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of
its excess cash with various central banks, including the
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting:

• the impact of netting on client-driven market-making

activities and collateral requirements, as well as

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions.

Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets,
reflecting lower client-driven activities, partially offset by
higher demand for securities to cover short positions.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities
borrowed.

Trading assets increased driven by:

• higher derivative receivables, primarily foreign exchange
and commodities as a result of market movements, as
well as higher levels of debt instruments related to client-
driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets,
and

largely offset by net purchases

• The increase in HTM was also due to purchases, partially

offset by paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42-43,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 76, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher originations and revolver utilization in CB,

• higher balances in Card driven by growth in revolving
balances on higher consumer spending and net new
originations, and

• higher wholesale loans in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as

sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates,
and

• the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in CBB.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net
addition of $1.8 billion to the allowance for loan losses,
consisting of:

• $1.6 billion in wholesale, resulting from

• higher deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

– loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.
Investment securities reflects the transfer of $73.2 billion
of securities from the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio to
the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio in the second
quarter of 2022.
• The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns,

as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”),

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast,

including deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios
and the increased weight placed on the adverse
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and

• $204 million in consumer driven by Card, reflecting

higher outstanding balances, predominantly offset by a
reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in
uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the

16

effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased, reflecting:

There was also a $290 million addition to the allowance for
lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets.

• higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates
and net additions, partially offset by the realization of
expected cash flows, and

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
57-76, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased
predominantly due to higher client receivables related to
client-driven activities in Markets, including prime
brokerage.

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued)

• additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of
Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of
2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen
Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
predominantly due to higher client payables related to
client-driven activities primarily in Markets, including prime
brokerage.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased
driven by higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller
conduit commercial paper issued to third parties. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and Notes 13
and 22 for additional information, specifically Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by:

• a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets,
and fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury
and CIO related to higher rates,

largely offset by

• net issuances in Markets and Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for
additional information.

Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of net
unrealized losses in AOCI, which were predominantly driven
by the impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash
flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Consolidated
statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 93,
and Note 19 for additional information.

Deposits decreased reflecting:

• a reduction in non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM
net outflows into investments as a result of the rising
interest rate environment,

partially offset by

• growth from new consumer and small business accounts
in CCB that more than offset the decline in deposits in
existing accounts as spending continued to grow, and

• an increase in Corporate driven by the Firm's
international consumer growth initiatives.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 and
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased due to:

• higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact
of netting on client-driven market-making activities in
Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in

Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 51-56 and Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings decreased as a result of lower
financing requirements in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 51-56 for additional information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities, which resulted in higher levels of short
positions in debt instruments, as well as higher derivative
payables as a result of market movements in Markets. Refer
to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on
pages 90-94.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE”
basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue

excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business
segments may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest
rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and
liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest
income to the segments.

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate
movements related to the transferred risk in its results.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 48, and page 93 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note
32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $605 million and $769 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,

respectively, and $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, Consumer & Business Banking was renamed Banking & Wealth Management.
(c) Included MSR risk management results of $54 million and $(145) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and

$191 million and $(363) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(d) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-

period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

23

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.3 billion, relatively flat compared to the
prior year.

Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 14%.

Net interest income was $10.6 billion, up 26%, driven by:

• higher margins and growth in deposits in CBB, and higher

revolving loans in Card,

partially offset by

• a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB
and lower NII in Home Lending predominantly due to
tighter loan spreads.

Noninterest revenue was $3.8 billion, down 9%, driven by:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and volume

in Home Lending, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline

in volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in
MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior
year driven by updates to model inputs,

• higher travel-related commissions,

• a gain on warrants associated with an equity investment,

and

• card income was relatively flat as the impact from the

increase in debit and credit card sales volume was offset by
higher amortization related to new account origination
costs.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in
the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage
fees and related income. Refer to Note 5 for additional
information on card income.

Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, up 11%, reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation,
marketing and technology,

 partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses driven by
lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $529 million, reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $679 million, up $188 million, largely

driven by loan growth in Card,

partially offset by

• a $150 million reserve release in Home Lending.

The allowance for loan losses in Card was flat as the addition
to the allowance resulting from higher outstanding balances
was offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the
pandemic gradually recede.

The prior year included a $950 million reduction in the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for a
further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance
for credit losses.

24

Year-to-date results
Net income was $10.3 billion, down 38%, predominantly
driven by a net increase in the provision for credit losses
compared with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $39.2 billion, an increase of 4%.

Net interest income was $27.6 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by:

• growth in deposits and higher margins in CBB, and higher

revolving loans in Card,

partially offset by

• a reduction associated with PPP loan forgiveness in CBB,
and lower NII in Home Lending driven by tighter loan
spreads.

Noninterest revenue was $11.6 billion, down 14%, driven by:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and volume

in Home Lending,

• lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to

new account origination costs, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline

in volume,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net gain in
MSR risk management compared with a net loss in the prior
year driven by updates to model inputs and higher
operating revenue on a higher level of third-party loans
serviced,

• higher asset management, administration and commissions

revenue predominantly driven by travel-related
commissions and increased annuity sales, and

• higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee

volume.

Noninterest expense was $23.5 billion, up 9%, reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural

expenses, largely driven by compensation, marketing and
technology,

 partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, largely

driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease
assets, partially offset by higher operating losses.

The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $1.8 billion, down $403 million, driven
by Card, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S.
consumers. However, median deposit balances continue to
decline, impacted by the growth in consumer spending, and

• a $125 million net addition to the allowance for credit
losses driven by Card, reflecting higher outstanding
balances, predominantly offset by a reduction related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior
as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

The prior year included an $8.2 billion reduction in the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of

$219 million and $355 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is
generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on consumer payment assistance
activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all
of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $57 million and $5 million of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the

SBA, respectively.

(d) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, included $791 million and $11.1 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 109 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was
$454 million and $3.1 billion in Home Lending, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered
delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-116 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on consumer payment
assistance activity.

(f) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $284 million and $432 million, respectively, that are

30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

Quarterly results
Net income was $3.5 billion, down 37%.
Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4%.
Banking revenue was $4.0 billion, down 18%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $1.7 billion, down 43%,
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, down 47%,
reflecting lower fees across products. The Firm ranked #1
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to
Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $290 million, down

72%, and debt underwriting fees were $624 million,
down 40%, as volatile market conditions resulted in
lower issuance activity.

– Advisory fees were $848 million, down 31%, driven by

a lower level of announced deals.

• Payments revenue was $2.0 billion, up 22%, and

included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding
this net impact, Payments revenue was $ 2.1 billion, up
41%, driven by improved deposit margins and growth in
fees on higher volumes.

• Lending revenue was $323 million, up 32%, driven by

higher net interest income on higher loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.9 billion, up
5%. Markets revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.5 billion, up 22%,
as elevated volatility drove strong performance in the
macro businesses, particularly in Currencies & Emerging
Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in
Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.3 billion, down 11%,

predominantly driven by lower revenue across products
compared to a record third quarter in the prior year.
• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%,

driven by lower market levels and lower deposits,
predominantly offset by improved deposit margins.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $31 million,
compared with a gain of $108 million in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $6.6 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by higher structural expense,
investments in the business and revenue-related expense,
including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $513 million,
predominantly driven by an addition to the allowance for
credit losses associated with loan and lending-related
commitment activity and the impact of updates to the
Firm’s macroeconomic scenarios.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net
benefit of $638 million.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

lower level of announced deals.

• Payments revenue was $5.3 billion, up 19%, and

included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding
this net impact, Payments revenue was $5.4 billion, up
25% driven by improved deposit margins and growth in
fees on higher volumes.

• Lending revenue was $1.1 billion, up 43%, driven by

higher net interest income on higher loans, as well as fair
value gains on hedges of accrual loans, compared with
losses in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.9 billion, up
1%. Markets revenue was $23.3 billion, up 5%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $14.9 billion, up
10%, driven by higher revenue in macro businesses,
particularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets, partially
offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.
• Equity Markets revenue was $8.4 billion, down 2%,

driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by
Derivatives.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%,

driven by improved deposit margins and growth in fees,
largely offset by lower market levels and lower deposits.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $773 million,

reflecting funding spread widening, and to a lesser extent
losses on exposure relating to commodities and Russia
and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a
gain of $338 million in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $20.7 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by higher structural expense and
investments in the business, including higher compensation,
as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by lower
volume- and revenue-related expense primarily revenue-
related compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion,
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, reflecting the impact of updates to the Firm's
macroeconomic forecast and loan growth.

benefit of $1.0 billion, driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets
revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized
upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $946 million, down 33%, reflecting a net
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a
net benefit in the prior year.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $2.8 billion, down 30%, reflecting a net
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a
net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $3.0 billion, up 21% compared to the
prior year. Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up 44%,
driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth
in loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher
funding costs on loans and lower deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $836 million, down 15%, driven
by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related
fees, partially offset by mark-ups on held-for-sale positions,
primarily unfunded commitments in the bridge financing
portfolio.

Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, up 14%, largely
driven by higher structural and volume- and revenue-
related expense, including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $618 million, reflecting
a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, largely
driven by growth in loans and lending-related commitments
and the impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios, compared with a net benefit of $363 million in
the prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Net revenue was $8.1 billion, up 10% compared to the
prior year. Net interest income was $5.5 billion, up 22%,
driven by the impact of higher deposit margins and growth
in loans, largely offset by the impact of higher funding costs
on loans.

Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, down 9%, driven by
lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on
held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in
the bridge financing portfolio, partially offset by a gain on
an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction
of a loan.

Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, up 16%,
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related and structural expense, including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, reflecting a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, driven by
growth in loans and lending-related commitments and the
impact of updates to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast,
compared with a net benefit of $858 million in the prior
year.

(a) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-

period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 2%.

Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up 6%. Net interest income
was $1.4 billion, up 43%. Noninterest revenue was $3.1
billion, down 6%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, down
5%, largely driven by:

• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in
market levels and the impact of net outflows, largely
offset by the removal of most money market fund fee
waivers, and

• net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in

the prior year,

largely offset by
• higher performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.3 billion, up
19%, driven by:

• improved margins and growth in deposits and to a lesser

extent in loans,

partially offset by

• lower management fees reflecting a decline in market

levels, largely offset by net inflows, and

• lower brokerage fees on reduced volume.

Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, up 10%, driven by
higher structural expense and investments in the business,
largely compensation.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $102
million, predominantly driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
57-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results
Net income was $3.2 billion, down 11%.

Net revenue was $13.2 billion, up 5%. Net interest income
was $3.7 billion, up 30%. Noninterest revenue was $9.4
billion, down 2%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $6.7 billion, down
1%, predominantly driven by:

net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $6.5 billion, up
14%, driven by:

• growth in deposits and loans as well as improved margins

• lower brokerage fees on reduced volume.

Noninterest expense was $8.8 billion, up 11%,
predominantly driven by higher structural expense and
investments in the business, largely compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $96 million, driven by a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared
with a net benefit of $191 million in the prior year.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $59 million and $64 million for the three months ended

September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $177 million and $197 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.
(c) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net income. Prior-

period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $294 million, compared with a net loss of
$916 million in the prior year.
Net revenue was a loss of $302 million, compared with a
loss of $1.3 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net
interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower
noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion, compared
with a loss of $242 million in the prior year, predominantly
driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries,
associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolios, and

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on
certain revenues, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening,

partially offset by

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates

related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO,
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, and

• lower net losses on certain legacy private equity

investments.

Noninterest expense of $305 million was up $145 million,
predominantly driven by:

• higher investments, including the costs associated with

the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and

• higher structural expense, including higher compensation

predominantly offset by the impact of movements in
foreign exchange rates on certain expenses, primarily as
a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred

42

to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was
not material to net income.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly
driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements and the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the
Firm's tax reserves.

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $1.3 billion, compared with a net loss of $3.1
billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.1 billion, compared with a loss
of $2.9 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net
interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower
noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.7 billion, compared
with a loss of $68 million in the prior year, driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries,
associated with repositioning the investment securities
portfolios,

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain

revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar
strengthening,

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments

compared with net gains in prior year,

• net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method
investment related to the Firm's international consumer
growth initiatives, and

• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment
transactions, which were more than offset by the related
net interest income earned on these transactions,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first

quarter of 2022, and

• higher net gains related to certain other Corporate

investments.

Noninterest expense of $695 million was down $856
million, predominantly driven by:
• lower structural expense reflecting the impact of

movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses
primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and
lower technology expense, partially offset by higher
compensation related expense,

largely offset by

• higher investments, including the costs associated with
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

The prior year included a contribution to the Firm's
Foundation.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred
to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was
not material to net income.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly
driven by benefits related to tax audit settlements and the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal, state and local taxes that also impacted the
Firm's tax reserves.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international
consumer growth initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the
Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital
wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in
C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first
quarter of 2022.

Treasury and CIO overview
At September 30, 2022, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the
table below was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Note 9 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects
the safety and soundness of the Firm.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2021
Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight
functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s
business activities.

Strategic risk

85

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of
risks, and impacts of risks.

governance and oversight.

44

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier
2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure
and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note
1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and the
CECL accounting guidance.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach
for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced
the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives
counterparty exposure under the Standardized and
Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not
used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR
in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the
U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel
III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion
based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December
31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30
bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease
in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of
SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser
extent than Standardized.

Risk-based Capital Targets
The Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1
capital ratio is 12.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and
13.0% by the end of the first quarter of 2023. These
targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in
effect, taking into account the Firm's increasing risk-based
regulatory capital requirements.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-
K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
capital risk.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies
(“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III
Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding
than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. While the Firm’s SLR is currently more
binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios,
the Firm expects that in the fourth quarter of 2022, the
Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios will become more
binding due to increases in the Firm's risk-based regulatory
capital requirements. As a result, the Firm announced the
redemption of $5.43 billion of preferred stock and issued
$3.5 billion of subordinated notes in the third quarter of
2022 to rebalance the Firm's capital components. Refer to
SLR on page 48 and capital actions on pages 48-49 for
additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021,
the CECL capital transition provisions,	which delayed the
effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired.
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital
benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, is being
phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
September 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining
$2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital
transition provisions.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 21 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s risk-based and
leverage-based capital metrics.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a
further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30,
2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR
framework.

securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months
ended September 30, 2022, compared with the three
months ended June 30, 2022, predominantly due to long-
term debt issuances and CIB Markets activities.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during
the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared
with the three months ended June 30, 2022 due to a
decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily
from a reduction in cash from a decline in deposits and loan
growth.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 was lower than the
same period in the prior year due to a decrease in
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a
reduction in cash from loan growth, non-HQLA investment
security purchases, and a decline in the market value of
HQLA-eligible investment securities in Treasury and CIO,
partially offset by an increase in deposits. Refer to Note 9
for additional information on the Firm's investment
securities portfolio.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity.

Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional
information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities,
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $771 billion and $914 billion as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be
raised at any particular time would be dependent on
prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased
compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a
decrease in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., as noted above.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $317
billion and $308 billion as of September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and other central banks. Although available, the
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks
as a primary source of liquidity.

51

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
“available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year
horizon.
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of
the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose
its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in
2023.

52

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short-
and long-term cash requirements.

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate
Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries
are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s
investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other
short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate
and liquidity risk characteristics.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

loans-to-deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than period-
end deposit balances. However, during periods of market
disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were higher for the three months ended
September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2021, reflecting:

• an increase in CCB driven by growth from new and existing

accounts across both consumer and small business
customers, and growth in time deposits in AWM,

partially offset by

• declines in both Payments and Securities Services in CIB

and in non-operating deposits in CB.

Average deposits were higher for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2021, reflecting:

• increases in CCB driven by growth from existing and new

accounts across both consumer and small business
customers, and

• net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of

certain government actions,

partially offset by

• a decline in Securities Services in CIB.

Period-end deposits have declined as a result of the
migration that began in the second quarter of 2022.

The decrease in period-end deposits reflects a reduction in
non-operating deposits in CB, and in AWM net outflows into
investments as a result of the rising interest rate
environment, partially offset by growth from new consumer
and small business accounts in CCB that more than offset the

53

decline in deposits in existing accounts as spending
continued to grow.

The increase in deposits in Corporate was driven by the
Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages
16-17 and pages 21-43, respectively, for further

(a) Primarily consists of short-term securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.
(b) Included in beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.
(d) Includes long-term structured notes which are secured.
(e) Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 45-50 and Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 93 of this Form 10-Q, and Note

21 and Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in
commercial paper for the average three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year
period, and the decrease in commercial paper at
September 30, 2022, from December 31, 2021, was due to
changes in the net issuance levels primarily for short-term
liquidity management.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased
at September 30, 2022, compared with December 31,
2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets and
the impact of netting on client-driven market-making
activities in Markets, partially offset by lower secured
financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

54

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and
credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and
collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of September 30, 2022,
were as follows:

(b) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, excluded operating lease assets of $12.9 billion and $17.1 billion, respectively. These operating lease

assets are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included $791 million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm

does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 109 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.

(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and

auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(j) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government

agencies of $362 million and $623 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee.
In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(l) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $57 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past

due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $14.9 billion and $35.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and

2021, respectively, and were $19.0 billion and $27.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts were
excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by
residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other
loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real
estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021,
reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021
reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net
recoveries were lower for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 when compared to the same periods
in the prior year driven by lower prepayments in the current
year due to higher interest rates.
Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as
warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced
originations due to higher interest rates and lower loan
purchase activity in CIB. Nonaccrual loans at fair value
decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio
activity in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $16.3 billion at September 30, 2022. This
amount included $5.3 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $5.2 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans
were $35.7 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential
mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The
credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the
performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

61

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared
with December 31, 2021 predominantly due to PPP loan
forgiveness in business banking and paydowns
predominantly offset by loan originations in the scored auto
portfolio. Net charge-offs increased for the three months
ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same
period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and scored
auto charge-offs. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 increased when compared to the
same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and
scored auto charge-offs, partially offset by lower scored
business banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net
charge-off rates were 0.27% and 0.03% for the three
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively, and 0.19% and 0.01% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as net
charge-offs benefited from government stimulus and
payment assistance programs in the prior year.

delinquent.

62

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021
largely driven by growth in revolving balances on higher
consumer spending and net new originations. The
September 30, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of
1.23% and 0.57%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of
1.04% and 0.50% but remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended
September 30, 2022 compared with the same period in the
prior year driven by loan growth. Net charge-offs decreased
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared
with the same period in the prior year. Delinquency and net
charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing
financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median
deposit balances continue to decline, impacted by the growth
in consumer spending.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At September 30, 2022, the Firm had $794 million of
credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in
TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs,
compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification
programs to borrowers.

63

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 66-69 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, credit
continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low.
As of September 30, 2022, the decrease in nonperforming
exposure was driven by a decline in lending related
commitments and loans, predominantly in CIB and AWM, as
a result of net portfolio activity and upgrades, largely offset
by downgrades including downgrades to certain Russia and
Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer
to Business Developments on page 9 and Country Risk on
pages 82-83 for additional information.

As of September 30, 2022, retained loans increased $35.9
billion driven by CB and CIB, including increased revolver
utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-
related commitments decreased $13.5 billion driven by net
portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-
sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, partially
offset by net portfolio activity in AWM.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics
equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when
determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.

Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or
changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, was $31.0 billion and $38.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7%
and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and
client-specific upgrades, partially offset by client-specific downgrades, including declines in Consumer & Retail, Real Estate and
Technology, Media & Telecommunications. Of the $31.0 billion of criticized exposure at September 30, 2022, approximately
half was undrawn and $28.3 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily
— was approximately 88% at both September 30, 2022,
and December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and
for a further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $92.5 billion and $57.1
billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher
foreign exchange and commodity derivative receivables as
a result of market movements. Derivative receivables
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in
the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current
credit risk should also take into consideration other
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The
benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the
derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions
from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature
of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the
credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant
central counterparty clearing house (“CCP”). Where
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains
credit protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related
notes. Information on credit portfolio management
activities is provided in the table below.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021
Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies
and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for
credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and
investment securities.

Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 59-63,

additional information on the consumer and wholesale
credit portfolios.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on
pages 85-87 for further information on the allowance for
credit losses and related management judgments.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022
was $20.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion
from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $1.9 billion in
wholesale and $168 million in consumer.

The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from:
• loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

• changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios

including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate
and deterioration in the equity market indices, and

– the impact of the increased weight placed on the

adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of
2022, due to the effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical
risks, including the war in Ukraine.

The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses
resulting from higher outstanding balances predominantly
offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the
pandemic gradually recede.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists
of high-quality securities. At September 30, 2022, the
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of
allowance for credit losses, was $616.5 billion, and the
average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 42-43 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-56 for
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market
Risk Management on pages 77-81 for further information
on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to
support underserved communities and minority-owned
businesses.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on
pages 138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was
removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also
removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated
average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR which remained elevated for the period ended June 30, 2022. For the three months ended September 30,
2022, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related exposure when compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2022.

(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.
(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification

benefit is not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended
September 30, 2022 when compared with June 30, 2022,
reflecting increased market volatility impacting Fixed
income, offset by risk reductions within CIB and Credit
Portfolio VaR.

Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $18 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2022, compared with the
same period in the prior year. This increase was
predominantly driven by market volatility impacting Fixed
income.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022
was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times
every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 261 days, and observed 25
VaR backtesting exceptions due to market volatility that was materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data
used for the VaR calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 33 of the
66 days, and observed seven VaR backtesting exceptions predominantly driven by interest rate volatility.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended September 30, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point
intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises
not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s
traditional banking activities, which include extension of
loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and
the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on
page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions
included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in
the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-
sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars
and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits,
deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt
and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer
pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 134 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a
net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a
parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-
term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve
involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing
long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving
increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates
constant or holding short-term rates constant and
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many
different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment
and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions
about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients
and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on
the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with
underlying contractual rates, the time since origination,
and other factors which are updated periodically based on
historical experience. Deposit forecasts used in the
baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions
relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,
represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could
change upon a given change in market interest rates. The
deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual
deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other
factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate
exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook
on page 8 for additional information).

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of
September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021
reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher interest
rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the
+/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is
primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities
repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a

the impact of liabilities repricing.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the movement in market
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these
sensitivities.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement
framework:

•

Lending exposures are measured at the total committed
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities
collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with
central banks, commercial banks, and other financial
institutions

•

Securities financing exposures are measured at their
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value
of all positions, including both long and short positions

•

•

Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair
value of the eligible collateral received

Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair
value of the derivative receivable or payable; reflecting
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory
requirements.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk
management.

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes
activity with both government and private-sector entities in
a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is
based on the country where the largest proportion of the
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal
residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors
attributed to that country. Activities which result in
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not
included in the country exposure measure (for example,
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure,
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an
individual country. The use of different measurement
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of
reported country exposure.

82

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2022 and
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in
exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash
placements with the central banks of those countries driven
by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.

The decrease in exposure to Australia was largely driven by
a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of
Australia, due to client-driven market-making activities and
lower client cash deposits following recent interest rate
increases.

As of September 30, 2022, exposure to Russia was
approximately $600 million. This amount excludes certain
client deposits placed at depository institutions.

Cybersecurity Risk
The Firm continues to face increased risk of cyber attacks
due to potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a
result of the war in Ukraine. The Firm implemented
additional precautionary measures and controls reasonably
designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced
threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the
measures taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity
breaches will provide absolute security against cyber
attacks.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems,
human factors, or external events impacting the Firm’s
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control),
cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to
comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure
of vendors or other third party providers to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position,
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the
Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on other
select examples of operational risks are provided below.

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have
been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and
individuals by various governments around the world,
including the authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU.
These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The
Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated
with interpreting and maintaining these complex
compliance programs. To manage this increased risk, the
Firm implemented additional controls reasonably designed
to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent
dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to
sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as
required by the applicable regulations.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services,
cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control that may impact critical business
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology,
facilities and third parties). The program includes
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks.

84

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2021 Form 10-K for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75 and
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 2.2% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
3.0% in the third quarter of 2023; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining
approximately 4.2% lower at the end of the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.9% in
the third quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a
peak difference of approximately 13.6% in the second
quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including:

• The allowance as of September 30, 2022, reflects credit
losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables.

and borrower behavior can significantly affect the
allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2022, the
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the
exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $500 million for residential

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.5 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $4.2 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2022.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for
further information.

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $11.1 billion
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $11.1 billion and $9.8
billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards
points earned on accelerated spend and promotional offers
outpacing redemptions throughout 2022. Refer to page
152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with
the accounting for income taxes.

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on
page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant valuation judgments
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
September 30, 2022.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021

Standard
Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and updated
January 2021

Summary of guidance
• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to
current accounting guidance when financial
instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and
other transactions are amended due to reference
rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain

contract amendments related to reference rate
reform as modifications rather than
extinguishments without the requirement to
assess the significance of the amendments.
• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge
accounting relationship without automatic
termination of that relationship. Provides various
practical expedients and elections designed to
allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted
during the transition period.

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities
out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain
criteria are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to
account for derivatives modified to change the
rate used for discounting, margining, or contract
price alignment (collectively “discounting
transition”) as modifications.

Effects on financial statements
• Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The

January 7, 2021 update was effective when
issued.

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the
practical expedients related to contract
modifications and hedge accounting
relationships, and discounting transition
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The
discounting transition election was applied
retrospectively. The main purpose of the
practical expedients is to ease the
administrative burden of accounting for
contracts impacted by reference rate reform.
These elections did not have a material impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted
Summary of guidance

Refer to the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms on pages 184-192 for definitions of terms and acronyms used throughout the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments
have been included such that this interim financial
information is fairly stated.

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances
where it has determined that the specified conditions are
met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

95

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets,
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

96

The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of September 30, 2022, and December 31,

(a) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $90.1 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, which were

mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

98

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge
funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $882 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30,
2022, and December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $41 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $841 million and $750 million,
respectively.

(e) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $11.4 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $7.5

billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with
the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $3.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of
such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable
components (that is, components that are actively quoted
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs
are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that
the input is being used to value.

In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $776 million, nonagency securities of $9 million and non-trading loans of $900 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $11 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-trading loans of $362 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $825 million and non-trading loans of $312 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $807 million including $227 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

100

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of
the underlying instruments and external market factors that
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s
positions.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in
fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. When a
determination is made to classify a financial instrument
within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table
below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2
risk management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to
such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2021, for those items measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 108
for further information on changes impacting items
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2022

reflecting an increase of $2.0 billion from June 30, 2022,
and an increase of $6.8 billion from December 31, 2021.

The increase for the three months ended September 30,
2022 was driven by a $2.2 billion increase in gross
derivative receivables due to gains and net transfers
partially offset by settlements.

The increase for the nine months ended September 30,
2022 was predominantly driven by:

• $3.8 billion increase in gross derivative receivables due
to gains and purchases partially offset by settlements.

• $2.6 billion increase in MSRs.

or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in
which they occur.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods
indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.1 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022, $1.0 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $927 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022, $65 million related to residential real

estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56% with a weighted average of 23%.

Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative),
with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of
September 30, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2021 was $3.6 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward

and downward carrying value changes.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2022 were $1.5 billion.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2022 were $(781) million.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a
nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa
Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6059 at September 30, 2022, and may be adjusted by Visa depending
on developments related to the litigation matters.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as
follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the

guarantees.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without
notice. Refer to page 171 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm
commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise

be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded
derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are
carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss
information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related
risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI,
while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in
principal transactions revenue were zero and $(6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $(9) million and
$(8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $8.7 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $28 million and
$10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further
information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.

The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited
number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as
derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or
for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and

payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained,
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are
shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown

separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of

the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

counterparty.

(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $77.4 billion and $67.6 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,

respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $81.7 billion and $64.3 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade),
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate

risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the

inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets
related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in
future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $15.0 billion and $25.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to
which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income
in future periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS
securities is $15.2 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $208 million and $9.7 billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has
been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in
future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net
interest income in future periods.

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed and SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022 and 2021.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.1) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at
September 30, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is
approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.

(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. The amounts reclassified for the nine months ended

September 30, 2022 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were not material. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans
and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees
and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic
hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on

protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than
the notional amount of protection sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of

protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on

the identical reference instrument.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives
as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is
based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the
reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where
JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair values of plan assets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension and
OPEB plans were $19.4 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively.

During the period ended September 30, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan was required
as a result of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of plan assets, reflecting
market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and
$2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in accumulated other comprehensive income (pre-tax).

Note 9 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management
activities. At September 30, 2022, the investment
securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an
average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings).

During the second quarter of 2022, the Firm transferred
$73.2 billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for
capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax
unrealized losses of $4.6 billion on the securities at the
date of transfer.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding the investment securities
portfolio.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at September 30,
2022 and December 31, 2021. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $11.5 billion and $2.2 billion, at September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than
changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

HTM securities – credit risk
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the
risk rating assigned to each security. At both September 30,
2022 and December 31, 2021, all HTM securities were
rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 98% rated at least AA+.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was
$61 million and $73 million as of September 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM
securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The

estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately nine years for agency residential MBS, and six years for
both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been
elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities
financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. When the
Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect
to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are
met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the
balances outstanding under its securities financing
agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its
counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the

counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net
Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to
the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral,
along with securities financing balances that do not meet all
these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is
presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on
the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other
assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts

reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty.

(c) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting

agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included $7.4 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively,
of securities purchased under resale agreements; $48.3 billion and $46.4 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $31.3 billion and $21.6 billion,

At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $295 million and $440 million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are
recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings
on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following
categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding
credit card
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)

Credit card

Wholesale(c)(d)

• Credit card loans

• Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the

wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral,

purpose, and type of borrower.

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
more information on SPEs.

The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools
as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
2021. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $2.4 billion and $7.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $11.6

billion and $19.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the
correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-
related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022 was $68 million and $(246) million, respectively, of which $(48) million and
$(80) million, respectively, related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $31 million and $225 million, respectively, of which $30 million and
$211 million, respectively, related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes
in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

138

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans,
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may
result in negative amortization.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as
follows: current included $27 million and $35 million; 30–149 days past due included $11 million for both periods; and 150 or more days past due
included $15 million and $20 million, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $26
million and $31 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2022,
approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered

collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $42 million and $41 million and $132 million and $127 million for the three and nine

months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO

band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2022.
(k) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $53 million and $66 million,

respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

141

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm
grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $80 million and
$116 million for the three months ended September 30,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and $313 million and $674
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively. There were no additional commitments
to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans
have been modified in TDRs.

Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various concessions to financially
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise
have been required under the terms of the original
agreement. The following table provides information about
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs
under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions.

exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are
generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of
residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans

and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction.
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At September 30, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified
in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.
government agencies, with a carrying value of $676 million and $619 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but
were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, auto and other loans excluded $358 million and $667 million, respectively, of PPP loans guaranteed by

the SBA that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the SBA guarantee.

(b) Includes $653 million of loans originated in 2021 and $138 million of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are

guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an
allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(c) Includes $4.4 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $1.0 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.
(d) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Loan modifications
Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to
be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,
were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been
modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 were not material.

(a) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans

excluded $57 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90
or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $53
million and $35 million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest
based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance
of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified
reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA.
There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90
or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30,
2022 and December 31, 2021.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves
subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be
negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was
not material for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022 and 2021.

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on
the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30,

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the
primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans.

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on the credit card loan portfolio, including
credit quality indicators.

The following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card
loans.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than
1% of total retained credit card loans.

(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default

in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they
defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified
credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small
businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating
assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these risk ratings.

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained
wholesale loans.

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically

occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs. New TDRs were $108 million and $180 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021,
respectively and $587 million and $832 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New
TDRs for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates primarily in the
Commercial and Industrial loan class in 2022 as well as principal deferrals largely in the Other loan class in 2021. New TDRs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflected modifications that included extending maturity dates and
covenant waivers for both periods as well as the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan in 2021 predominantly in
the Commercial and Industrial loan class. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

The carrying value of TDRs was $852 million and $607 million as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively.

(a) At September 30, 2022 excludes an allowance for credit losses associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB of $30 million.
(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to be
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At September 30, 2022 and 2021, lending-related commitments excluded $12.6 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit

card portfolio segment; $798.9 billion and $710.6 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $20.0 billion and $41.0 billion,
respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

152

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022
was $20.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion
from December 31, 2021, consisting of: $1.9 billion in
wholesale and $168 million in consumer.

The net addition to the wholesale allowance resulted from:

• loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and

• changes to the Firm's macroeconomic forecast reflecting

– updates to the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios

including an increasing forecasted unemployment rate
and deterioration in the equity market indices, and

– the impact of the increased weight placed on the

adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of
2022, due to the effects associated with higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical
risks, including the war in Ukraine.

The increase in the consumer allowance was driven by Card,
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses
resulting from higher outstanding balances predominantly
offset by a reduction related to a decrease in uncertainty
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the
pandemic gradually recede.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.0% in the third quarter of 2023, and a 1.6%
lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(b) As of September 30, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial
interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal
amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$12.5 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other
than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$11.5 billion and $13.4 billion at September 30, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of
JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.1 billion and $2.6 billion at September 30, 2022,
and December 31, 2021, respectively.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing

157

member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $27.6
billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.0 billion and $9.4
billion was unfunded at September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each
project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying
amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies
for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing
tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders
for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 was $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion,
respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $8.2
billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by
the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for
additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured
or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to
Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

As of September 30, 2022, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as
well as actual business results and projections of business
performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of
September 30, 2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was
goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine
months ended September 30, 2022 or 2021.

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.

short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a
particular assumption may have on the fair value is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the
impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and
outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as
defined below.

Firm as lessee
At September 30, 2022, JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for
premises and equipment used primarily for business
purposes.

Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”) assets
are recognized at the lease commencement date based on
the present value of the future minimum lease payments
over the lease term.

Note 20 – Restricted cash and other restricted
assets
Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other
restricted assets.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s
restricted cash:

CECL regulatory capital transition
On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition
provisions,	which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory
capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022,
the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of
December 31, 2021, is being phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of September 30, 2022, CET1
capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier
2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure
and RWA, as applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the
Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI
subsidiaries are subject.

(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the
Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each
include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of
3.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.2% SCB for Basel III
Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to
0% by the federal banking agencies.

(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The

CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI
subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.

(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to

regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.

(d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations

issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the
Firm’s related accounting policies.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments.

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The
amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and
certain scored business banking lending-related
commitments represent the total available credit for these
products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these
products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can
reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business
banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or,
in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In
addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the
borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce
or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the
value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.
(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.
(d) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $29 million  and $44 million,

respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $8.5 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees; and $502 million and $451 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments
are shown gross of risk participations.

(e) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $326.0
billion and $357.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S.
GSEs and government agencies.

(f) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo

program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(g) At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, primarily includes unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, unfunded

commitments to purchase secondary market loans, and other equity investment commitments.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-

related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value. At September
30, 2022, includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio.

172

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to
Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-
backs.

173

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house
therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 172. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 172 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.

Pledged assets
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

Collateral
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation

Contingencies
As of September 30, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations,
government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and
regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of
business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and
statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges
“dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in
relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million,
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by
1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited.
In September 2022, the Firm filed an application
challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s
jurisdiction to hear the claim.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase
entities into residential housing projects developed by the
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately
$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major
international oil companies. The account held
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the
accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were

175

instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments
may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and
April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in
favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full.
The FRN has requested permission to appeal the decision
relating solely to the 2013 payment of approximately
$75 million.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm a five-year
exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm
will need the DOL to approve a further exemption to cover
the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period
following the antitrust plea. In October 2022, the DOL
published a proposed exemption for the remainder of the
disqualification period. This proposal will be open for public
comment until December 2022. The only remaining FX-
related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition
Commission matter which is currently pending before the
South Africa Competition Tribunal.

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on
futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed
requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and
certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of
these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class
action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign
exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates.
Another putative class action was brought against the Firm
and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported
indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court
approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants
of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition,
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action
pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal,
proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's
denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out

basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached
in the putative class action, which remains subject to court
approval.

Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. In
December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered
into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective
civil investigations of compliance with records preservation
requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap
dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and
CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain
copies of certain communications required to be maintained
under their respective record keeping rules, where such
communications were sent or received by employees over
electronic messaging channels that had not been approved
for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also
included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found
related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC paid a $125 million civil monetary
penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
paid a total $75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC.
The Firm continues to respond to requests for information
and other material from certain authorities concerning its
compliance with records preservation requirements in
connection with business communications sent over
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved
by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.

In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting
breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities
laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise
adequate oversight over compliance with records
preservation requirements. The complaint seeks damages,
restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance
reforms. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint in August
2022, which defendants have moved to dismiss.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the

176

parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants
collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the
approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in
part, and denied the motion in part.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain
subject, continues. In December 2016, the European
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other
banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that
decision with the European General Court, and that appeal
is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards.
Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In
December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a
preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from
setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial

instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In September
2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its
entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
asserting similar antitrust claims in October 2022. The
Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss
franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and
Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective
investigations relating to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S.
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to
2016.

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after
three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully
comply with all of their obligations.

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the
total monetary amount includes victim compensation
payments.

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Firm and certain former employees,
alleging a precious metals futures and options price
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in July 2022,
the Court granted final approval of a settlement among the
parties. In addition, several putative class actions were filed
in the United States District Courts for the Northern District
of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the
Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity
Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The
Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in June
2022, the Court granted final approval of a settlement
among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have commenced

177

the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $47 million and $76
million for the three months ended September 30, 2022
and 2021, respectively, and $239 million and $289 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation
reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged
underlying conduct related to precious metals.

In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during
the putative class period were materially false and
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.

In May 2022, a shareholder derivative suit purporting to act
on behalf of the Firm, was filed in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York asserting breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment claims against certain current and
former officers and directors of the Firm. The complaint
claims the Firm’s Board of Directors wrongfully rejected the
shareholder’s demand to commence litigation and seeks
damages, disgorgement and corporate governance reforms
on the basis of alleged supervisory failures with regard to
certain historical spoofing-related conduct that was the
subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC
in September 2020, as well as certain fiduciary activities
that were separately the subject of a resolution between
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020.
Defendants have moved to dismiss.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants are opposing.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with

178

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are
determined based on the products and services provided, or
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in
which financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis.
The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm

(and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE
basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of
the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

November 3, 2022

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of September 30, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income
and changes in stockholders’ equity for the three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and
2021 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we
are not aware of any material modifications that should be
made to the accompanying interim financial statements for
them to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of
the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the
year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report
dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph
describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit
losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
information as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

solutions.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include,
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to
the protection seller for the difference between the face

criteria

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However,
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Macro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates,
Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing
and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to present
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management
also uses this financial measure at the segment level,
because it believes this provides information to enable
investors to understand the underlying operational
performance and trends of the particular business segment
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with
the performance of competitors.

Markets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity
Markets businesses.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and

Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities
without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Merchant Services: offers merchants payment processing
capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics,
and other payments services. Through Merchant Services,
merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and
debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.

MEV: Macroeconomic variable

Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

186

Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Exchange Act of 1934.

Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained
loans for the reporting period.

interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically
maintained on nonaccrual status.

nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs, which
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock
and participating securities, based on their respective rights
to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital
requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and
prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar”
approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through
disclosure requirements which allow market participants to
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association (“SBA”)

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer
spread, which is the difference between the price at which
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and
the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and

187

losses on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced.

typically contain embedded (but not separable or
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates
or indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results,
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities; the corresponding income tax
impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within
income tax expense.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is
derived from a weighted average of the performance
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer

191

categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and
five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers.
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 133-140
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting” on page 156 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information. There was
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three
months ended September 30, 2022, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information
that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3:
Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.
