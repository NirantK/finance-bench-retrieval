Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first
quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021, unless
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $8.3 billion for the
first quarter of 2022, or $2.63 per share, on net revenue of
$30.7 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 13% and ROTCE of
16%. The Firm's results for the first quarter of 2022
included a net increase in the allowance for credit losses of
$902 million and a loss of $524 million in Credit
Adjustments & Other in CIB.

• The Firm had net income of $8.3 billion, down 42%.

• Total net revenue was down 5%.

5

– Noninterest revenue was $16.8 billion, down 13%,
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, lower net
production revenue in Home Lending, and losses on
legacy equity investments compared to gains in the
prior year in Corporate. The decrease also reflected the
loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB.

– Net interest income was $13.9 billion, up 8%. Net

interest income excluding Markets was $11.8 billion,
up 9%, predominantly driven by balance sheet growth
and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from
Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans.

• Noninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 2%,

predominantly driven by investments and structural
expense across the LOBs, largely offset by lower volume-
and revenue-related expense, including revenue-related
compensation in CIB. The prior-year expense included a
$550 million contribution to the Firm’s Foundation.

• The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, driven by;
– a net addition of $902 million to the allowance for

credit losses, which largely reflects an increased weight
placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more
balanced weighting placed on the adverse and upside
scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the potential
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including
the war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance also
included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades in CIB and AWM, and

– $582 million of net charge-offs, down $475 million,

driven by Card.

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $4.2 billion,
reflecting a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses of $5.2 billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $19.6 billion at
March 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.69%,
compared with 2.42% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.6 billion at
March 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.7 billion from the
prior year, driven by lower nonaccrual loans, reflecting
improved credit performance in consumer; and in
wholesale, net portfolio activity as well as client-specific
upgrades, largely offset by client-specific downgrades,
including Russia and Russia-associated clients.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 5%,

driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 13%,
reflecting inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the
ongoing effect of certain government actions. In CCB, the
increase was also driven by growth from new and existing

accounts across both consumer and small business
customers.

Selected capital-related metrics
• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $208 billion, and the

Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 11.9% and
12.7%, respectively.

Credit provided and capital raised
JPMorgan Chase continues to support consumers,
businesses and communities around the globe. The Firm
provided new and renewed credit and raised capital for
wholesale and consumer clients during the first three
months of 2022, consisting of:

• The Firm’s SLR was 5.2%.

• The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the first quarter of 2022 at

$69.58, up 5% versus the prior year.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q,
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to
Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 and page 155 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors
that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ
materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is
no assurance that actual results will be in line with the
outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2022 should be
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.
economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive
environment, client and customer activity levels, and
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and
other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm
will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its
businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

Full-year 2022
• Management expects net interest income excluding

Markets to be in excess of $53 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be

approximately $77 billion, which includes increased
investments in technology, distribution and marketing,
and higher structural expense.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16.

Providing humanitarian assistance
In support of the relief efforts, the Firm has made a $10
million commitment to help address the Ukrainian
humanitarian crisis.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 9-33 of the
JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm.

For purposes of this Form 10-Q, "Russia" refers to exposure
to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the
largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest
proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on
the Firm’s internal country risk management framework;
"Russia-associated" refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic
or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have
been imposed or which have close association with Russia.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
JPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue to
make progress with respect to the transition from the use of
the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other
IBORs to comply with the International Organization of
Securities Commission's standards for transaction-based
benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the
principal tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight,
one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR)
is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

The Firm continues to engage with and support clients as
they move to replacement rates. In connection with the
transition, as of March 31, 2022 the Firm had remediated
96% of the notional amount of its bilateral derivatives
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR by virtue of
counterparty adherence to, or the contracts otherwise
being subject to, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc.'s ("ISDA") IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, and
continues its client outreach with respect to U.S. dollar
LIBOR-linked loans.

The Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,
market, regulatory and legislative developments. Refer to
Business Developments on pages 50-51 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional information.

Business Developments
War in Ukraine
Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Firm’s
business activities related to Russia have generally been
limited to assisting clients with fulfilling or terminating pre-
existing obligations and managing their Russia-associated
risks, as well as providing payment services and acting as a
custodian for global clients who hold Russia and Russia-
associated financial instruments.

The Firm increased its allowance for credit losses in the first
quarter due in part to client-specific Russia and Russia-
associated downgrades. However, the Firm's exposure to
Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is
not material to its financial condition or results of
operations.

The Firm continues to assess the ongoing secondary
impacts of the war in Ukraine, including: increased market
volatility, effects on global energy and commodities
markets, client demand for credit and liquidity, distress in
certain industries or economic sectors, heightened
counterparty credit risk, potential recessionary and
inflationary pressures, impacts on global supply chains and
government actions, including the imposition of financial
and economic sanctions.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 54-62,
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65, Market Risk
Management on pages 67-71 and Country Risk
Management on pages 72-73 for additional information.

Complying with global sanctions
The Firm has engaged and continues to engage with
government authorities, regulators, and industry groups in
connection with analyzing and implementing procedures
reasonably designed to comply with financial and economic
sanctions imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities
and individuals by various governments around the world.

Managing key operational risks
The Firm faces increased operational risk in its efforts to
comply with the various financial and economic sanctions
that have been imposed as a result of the war in Ukraine, as
the requirements are highly complex and continue to
evolve.

The Firm is also focused on risks related to the increased
potential for cyber attacks that may be conducted in
retaliation for the sanctions imposed.

Refer to Operational Risk Management on page 74 for
additional information.

Supporting employees
The Firm has provided additional benefits and support to
employees who have been affected by the war.

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by

growth in transaction volume, and

• higher deposit-related fees in CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 19-21,
pages 22-26 and pages 27-28, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased predominantly driven by:

• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term products, as

well as higher performance fees, in AWM, and

$  30,717

$  32,266

• higher net inflows and average market levels in CCB.

(a)  Included operating lease income of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the

three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower equity underwriting fees primarily driven by lower
issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA,

• lower debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by
high-yield bonds as a result of reduced issuances in a
volatile market,

partially offset by

• higher advisory fees benefiting from the closing of deals

announced in 2021.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased largely in CIB,
reflecting:

• a loss of $524 million in Credit Adjustments & Other,

predominantly driven by funding spread widening, and
credit valuation adjustments related to increases in
commodities exposures and markdowns of derivative
receivables from Russia-associated counterparties,

• lower revenue in Equity Markets, particularly in

derivatives and Cash Equities, compared to a strong prior
year, and

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21,
pages 29-31, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net
investment securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, compared with net
gains in the prior year, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolios in both periods in Treasury
and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
32-33 and Note 9 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower
production revenue from lower margins and volume, largely
offset by higher net mortgage servicing revenue on an
increase in MSR risk management results primarily driven
by changes in prepayment expectations. Refer to CCB
segment results on pages 19-21, Note 5 and 14 for
additional information.

Card income decreased due to higher amortization related
to new account origination costs in Card. Refer to CCB, CIB
and CB segment results on pages 19-21, pages 22-26 and
pages 27-28, respectively, and Note 5 for additional
information.

Other income increased reflecting:

• net gains on equity investments in CIB,

• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, particularly in

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and

Securitized Products largely due to the rising rate
environment, which slowed down the pace of mortgage
production, predominantly offset by higher revenue in
Currencies & Emerging Markets on elevated client activity
in a volatile market.

The decrease in Principal transactions revenue also reflects
net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year.

• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in
the prior year on certain renewable energy investments
in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a

decline in volume, and

• lower net investment valuation gains in AWM.

9

Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet
growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from
PPP loans.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.4
trillion, up $275 billion, predominantly driven by higher
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield
was 1.86%, down 1 basis point (“bp”). The net yield on
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.67%, a decrease of 2
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 1.95%, up 2 bps.

Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 165 for further details;
and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a further
discussion of Net interest yield excluding Markets.

The provision for credit losses increased driven by:

• a net addition of $902 million to the allowance for credit
losses, consisting of $776 million in wholesale and $127
million in consumer. The addition largely reflects an
increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios, from
the more balanced weighting placed on the adverse and
upside scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the
potential effects associated with higher inflation, changes
in monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including
the war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance also
included client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades in CIB and AWM,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs of $475 million driven by Card, as

consumer cash balances remained elevated.

The prior year included a $5.2 billion net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21, CIB on pages

Compensation expense increased driven by investments
and higher structural expense across the LOBs, partially
offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher structural expense, including professional fees,

• higher investments, including technology expense across

the LOBs and marketing expense in CCB,

• higher brokerage expense in CIB, as well as other outside

services expense, and

• higher legal expense predominantly in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense in CCB due to lower auto

lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle collateral
values.

The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the
Firm's Foundation.

Loans were relatively flat, and reflected:

• lower residential real estate loans at fair value in Home
Lending as sales outpaced originations due to higher
interest rates, and

• a decline in AWM due to paydowns and lower securities-

based lending,

offset by

• higher wholesale loans in CB and CIB.

The allowance for loan losses increased as a result of a net
addition of $806 million to the allowance for credit losses,
consisting of $677 million in wholesale and $129 million in
consumer. The addition largely reflects an increased weight
placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more balanced
weighting placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at
December 31, 2021, due to the potential effects associated
with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, as well as
geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine. The increase
in the allowance also included client-specific Russia and
Russia-associated downgrades in CIB and AWM.

There was a $97 million addition to allowance for lending-
related commitments. This allowance is included in other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of growth in deposits.
Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its
excess cash with various central banks, including the
Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting:

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions,

• higher collateral requirements, and

• the impact of client-driven market-making activities.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, resulting
from higher client-driven activities and an increase in
demand for securities to cover short positions. Refer to
Note 10 for additional information on securities purchased
under resale agreements and securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased driven by Markets, due to:

• higher securities related to client-driven market-making

activities, and

• higher derivative receivables, largely commodities,
predominantly oil and gas, as a result of market
movements.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased resulting from net
purchases of securities, largely offset by paydowns, and
unrealized losses on AFS securities which are recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"). Refer
to Corporate segment results on pages 32-33, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 66, and Notes 2 and 9
for additional information.

Deposits increased in CIB, CCB and AWM, driven by:

• higher deposits in CIB's Payments and Securities Services

primarily driven by client activities, and

• growth in new and existing accounts in CCB across

consumer and small business customers,

partially offset by

• a decline in CB, principally due to seasonality.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 and
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased due to the impact
of client activities and higher secured financing of trading
assets in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 41-45 and Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher net
issuance of commercial paper primarily for short-term
liquidity management in Treasury and CIO. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 for additional
information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in
higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, as well
as higher derivative payables associated with market
movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional
information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting
higher client payables related to client-driven activities
primarily in Markets, including prime brokerage, during a
period of heightened market volatility. Refer to Note 10 for
additional information on securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased
driven by maturities of credit card securitizations in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 41-45 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional
information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization
trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by fair value hedge
accounting adjustments related to higher rates, partially
offset by net issuances in Treasury and CIO, as well as a
decline in the fair value of structured notes in CIB. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 41-45 for additional
information.

Stockholders’ equity decreased as a result of a net
unrealized loss in AOCI, which was primarily driven by the
impact of higher rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow
hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to page 83 for
information on changes in stockholders’ equity, Capital
actions on page 39, and Note 19 for additional information.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on
pages 80-84.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE”
basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue

excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense

excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business
segments may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing ("FTP") is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to each business
segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and
liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO within Corporate.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate
risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology
and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to
reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the business
segments.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 38, and page 93 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $694 million and
$916 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for

allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net
income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $109 million and $(115)
million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

Net interest income was $8.3 billion, up 5%, driven by:

• growth in deposits net of margin compression partially

offset by lower PPP loan forgiveness, in CBB, and

• higher revolving loans in Card.

Noninterest revenue was $3.9 billion, down 15%, driven
by:

• lower production revenue from lower margins and

volume in Home Lending,

• higher amortization related to new account origination

costs in Card, and

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline

in volume,

        partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue on an increase in

MSR risk management results primarily driven by
changes in prepayment expectations,

• higher asset management fees as a result of higher net

inflows and average market levels, and

• higher deposit-related fees.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information on card income.

Noninterest expense was $7.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting:

• investments in the business and increased structural
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation,
technology and marketing,

 partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue- related expenses primarily
depreciation expense due to lower auto lease assets and
the impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was $678 million, reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $553 million, down $470 million,
driven by Card, as consumer cash balances remained
elevated, and

• a $125 million addition to the allowance for credit losses

in Home Lending.

The prior year included a $4.6 billion reduction in the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for
a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90
or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $315
million and $458 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded
based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is
generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status
as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that were under

payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 49-53 for further information on
consumer payment assistance activity. Includes loans to customers that have
exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days
past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at
time of exit.

(c) At March 31, 2022 nonaccrual loans excluded $179 million of PPP loans 90 or

more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(d) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current

presentation.

(e) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, included $2.9 billion and $23.4 billion of loans,

respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to
realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed
by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 48 for a further discussion of the
PPP.

(f) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending,
Card and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1) $728 million and $8.1 billion in
Home Lending, respectively; (2) $15 million and $105 million in Card,
respectively; and (3) $45 million and $127 million in Auto, respectively. Loans
that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not
considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 49-53 for
further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

(g) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.

government agencies of $370 million and $557 million, respectively, that are
30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee.

(a) Consists primarily of centrally managed credit valuation adjustments
(“CVA”), funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives, other
valuation adjustments, and certain components of fair value option
elected liabilities, which are primarily reported in principal
transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging
activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income
Markets and Equity Markets.

Quarterly results
Net income was $4.4 billion, down 26%.
Net revenue was $13.5 billion, down 7%.
Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 6%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $2.1 billion, down 28%,
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, down 31%,
reflecting lower equity and debt underwriting fees. The
Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,
according to Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $249 million, down
76%, primarily driven by lower issuance activity,
particularly in North America and EMEA.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 20%,

predominantly driven by high-yield bonds as a result of
reduced issuances in a volatile market.

– Advisory fees were $801 million, up 18%, benefiting

from the closing of deals announced in 2021.
• Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33%, and

included net gains on equity investments. Excluding these
net gains, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 9%,
predominantly driven by higher fees, deposits and
improved deposit margins.

• Lending revenue was $321 million, up 21%,

predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of
accrual loans, compared to losses in the prior year.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.3 billion,
down 8%. Markets revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, down
1%, particularly in Securitized Products, largely due to
the rising rate environment, which slowed down the pace
of mortgage production, predominantly offset by higher
revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets on elevated
client activity in a volatile market.

22

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, down 7%,

driven by lower revenue in derivatives and Cash Equities,
compared to a strong prior year.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2%,

driven by improved deposit margins and growth in fees.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million,
driven by funding spread widening as well as credit
valuation adjustments relating to both increases in
commodities exposures and markdowns of derivative
receivables from Russia-associated counterparties.
Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 3%, driven by
higher structural expense, investments in the business and
legal expense, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-
related expense including revenue-related compensation.

The provision for credit losses of $445 million was driven
by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses,
compared with a net benefit of $331 million in the prior
year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition
of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets
revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized
upon executing new transactions.

(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 17 for discussion of

revenue sharing.

Quarterly results
Net income was $850 million, down 28%, largely driven by
a net increase in the provision for credit losses compared
with a net benefit in the prior year.

Net revenue was $2.4 billion, flat compared to the prior
year. Net interest income was $1.5 billion, up 4%, driven
by the impact of higher deposits. Noninterest revenue was
$867 million, down 5%, driven by lower investment
banking revenue, predominantly offset by higher payments
revenue.

Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, up 17%, largely
driven by investments in the business and higher volume-
and revenue- related expense, including compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $157 million, driven by a
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared
with a net benefit of $118 million in the prior year.

(a) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for

allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net
income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.0 billion, down 20%.

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up 6%. Net interest income
was $1.1 billion, up 16%. Noninterest revenue was $3.2
billion, up 3%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3 billion, up 6%
driven by:

• higher asset management fees, net of liquidity fee

waivers, on strong cumulative net inflows into long-term
products, and higher performance fees,

partially offset by

• lower net investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.0 billion, up 6%
driven by:

• higher loans including the impact of lower funding costs,

and

• growth in deposits, net of margin compression,

partially offset by

• lower brokerage fees on reduced volume.

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 11%
predominantly driven by higher structural expense and
investments in the business, largely driven by
compensation, and higher volume- and revenue-related
expense, including distribution fees.

The provision for credit losses was $154 million, driven by
an addition to the allowance for credit losses, compared
with a net benefit of $121 million in the prior year.

46-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income
from municipal bonds, of $58 million and $67 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, the Firm changed its methodology for

allocating income taxes to the LOBs, with no impact to Firmwide net
income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $856 million compared with a net loss of $852
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $881 million, compared with a
loss of $473 million in the prior year.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments,

compared with net gains in the prior year, and

• net investment securities losses on sales of U.S.

Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,
compared with net gains in the prior year, associated with
repositioning the investment securities portfolios in both
periods,

partially offset by

• proceeds from an insurance settlement.

Net interest income increased primarily driven by higher
rates, which resulted in slower prepayments.

Noninterest expense of $184 million was down $691
million primarily driven by the absence of the contribution
to the Firm's Foundation recorded in the prior year.

The current period tax benefit was predominantly driven by
the change in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's International
Consumer activity, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's
digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth
manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6
Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the current
quarter.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects
the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

34

PPP. As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had $3.6 billion of
loans remaining under the PPP program, which receive a
zero percent risk weight under the federal banking
agencies’ regulatory capital rule. The Firm does not expect
to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the
loans are guaranteed by the SBA.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending
Facility, which would have allowed the Firm to exclude them
under the final rule.

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach
for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced
the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives
counterparty exposure under Standardized approach RWA
and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not
used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR
in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the
U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel
III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Based on the derivatives exposure as of December 31,
2021, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm’s
Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion, a decrease
of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio at
March 31, 2022, and resulted in a modest decrease in its
total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR
increased the Firm's Advanced RWA at March 31, 2022, but
to a lesser extent than Standardized.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-
K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
Capital Risk Management.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III
Standardized-risk-based ratios are currently more binding
than the Basel III Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more binding
than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios. Refer to
SLR on page 38 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition. On December 31, 2021,
the CECL capital transition provisions,	which delayed the
effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, expired.
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital
benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021, will be
phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
March 31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining
75%, or $2.2 billion, benefit associated with the CECL
capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier
2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage
exposure.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note
1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and the
CECL accounting guidance.

approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021

RWA rollforward
The following table presents changes in the components of RWA under Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches for the
three months ended March 31, 2022. The amounts in the rollforward categories are estimates, based on the predominant
driver of the change. The increase in both Standardized and Advanced Market risk RWA at March 31, 2022 is largely due to the
effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market.

N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the
LCR rule.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of
ongoing business activity.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities,
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity.
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $939 billion and $914 billion as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively,
although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any
particular time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The fair value increased compared to December
31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in CIB trading
assets.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral
pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $298
billion and $308 billion as of March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity
excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the
Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and other central banks. Although available, the
Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks
as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) rule requires that the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
“available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year
horizon.
As of March 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current understanding of
the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose
its quarterly average NSFR semi annually beginning in
2023.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021
based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short-
and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate
Holding Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries
are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess
funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s
investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other
short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate
and liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-balance
sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of
market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2021, reflecting inflows across the LOBs
primarily driven by the ongoing effect of certain
government actions. In CCB, the increase was also driven by
growth from new and existing accounts across both
consumer and small business customers.

Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on
pages 17-33 and pages 12-13, respectively, for further

21 and Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased
at March 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021,
due to the impact of client activities and higher secured
financing of trading assets in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds. The increase in
commercial paper at March 31, 2022, from December 31,
2021, and for the average three months ended March 31,
2022 compared to the prior year period, was due to higher
net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at
March 31, 2022, from December 31, 2021, and for the
average three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to
the prior year period, was primarily due to higher
overdrafts in CIB.

43

The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through
securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB
advances. The following table summarizes the securitization
issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for
client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding
for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer
to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further description of the client-driven loan securitizations.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance
and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the
IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and
credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and
collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2022, were

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not

experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met,
home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some
cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

million and $623 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy
is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(l) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $179 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $23.9 billion and $21.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

49

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. In the first
quarter of 2022, the COVID-19 consumer payment deferral
programs ended for new enrollments, except for loans
collateralized by residential real estate, as that program
remains in effect due to the U.S. government's extension of
its declaration of a national emergency with respect to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm had approximately $825
million of retained consumer loans under payment deferral
programs, predominantly in residential real estate.
Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral
programs are current. During the first quarter of 2022, there
were approximately $385 million of new enrollments in
consumer payment deferral programs. Refer to Note 12 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for additional
information.

50

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by
residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other
loans, partially offset by higher retained residential real
estate loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021
in AWM, on slower prepayments. Retained nonaccrual loans
decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved
credit performance. Net recoveries for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 were higher when compared with
the same period in the prior year as the current year
benefited from the recovery on a loan sale as well as
further improvement in Home Price Index ("HPI").
Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as
sales outpaced originations in Home Lending due to higher
interest rates and lower loan purchase activity in CIB.
Nonaccrual loans at fair value increased from
December 31, 2021 driven by CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $17.6 billion at March 31, 2022. This
amount included $5.9 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $5.7 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were
$32.1 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by
an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly
in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, in line with the performance of the
broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

which are still within their deferral period and performing according to
their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared
with December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in business
banking loans driven by PPP loan forgiveness. Scored auto
portfolio loans were relatively flat as paydowns were offset
by loan originations. Net charge-offs for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 increased when compared to the
same period in the prior year due to higher overdraft and
scored auto charge-offs partially offset by lower scored
business banking charge-offs. The scored auto portfolio net
charge-off rates were 0.18% and 0.13% for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

respectively, and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $6
million and $5 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(b) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in

response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans

excluded $179 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90
or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

Nonaccrual loans
The following table presents changes in consumer,
excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

52

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2021
reflecting the impact of seasonality. The March 31, 2022
30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.09% and 0.54%,
respectively, increased compared to the December 31,
2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and
0.50%, also reflecting the impact of seasonality. Net
charge-offs decreased for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 compared with the same period in the
prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to
benefit from elevated consumer cash balances.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At March 31, 2022, the Firm had $901 million of credit
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs,
which does not include loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs,
compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to
Note 11 for additional information about loan modification
programs to borrowers.

53

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 56-59 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated
exposures held in CCB, including business banking and auto
dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is
applied when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit
continued to perform well with charge-offs at historically
low levels, however, nonperforming exposure increased
driven by client-specific Russia and Russia-associated
downgrades. Refer to Business Developments on page 8
and Country Risk on pages 72-73 for additional
information.

As of March 31, 2022, retained loans increased $9.6 billion
driven by CIB and CB partially offset by decreases in AWM.
Lending-related commitments increased $10.8 billion,
driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.

As of March 31, 2022, the net increase in nonperforming
loans of $303 million was driven by client-specific Russia
and Russia-associated downgrades. Nonperforming
derivatives increased $281 million largely driven by client-
specific downgrades in commodities.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31,
2022, and December 31, 2021. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further information on
internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.
Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or
changes in market conditions.

55

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries
with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the
special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, was $36.9 billion and $38.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, representing approximately 3.2% and
3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The decrease in criticized exposure was driven by client-specific
upgrades and net portfolio activity, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. The $36.9 billion of criticized exposure at
March 31, 2022 was largely undrawn and $33.2 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The industry of
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily
— was approximately 88% at both March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.
Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $73.6 billion and $57.1
billion at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
respectively. The increase was largely commodities,
predominantly oil and gas, as a result of market
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally
enforceable master netting agreements and the related
cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in
the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current
credit risk should also take into consideration other
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule.

The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the
derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis,
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These
receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage
risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions
from its market-making activities, including the
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables.
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature
of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the
credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant
central counterparty clearing house ("CCP"). Where
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains
credit protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related
notes. Information on credit portfolio management
activities is provided in the table below.

and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowances for

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2022 was
$19.6 billion, an increase from $18.7 billion at
December 31, 2021, consisting of: $776 million in
wholesale, across the LOBs, and $127 million in consumer,
driven by the residential real estate portfolio.

The change in the allowance largely reflects an increased
weight placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more
balanced weighting placed on the adverse and upside
scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the potential
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including the
war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance also included
client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates
above 4% through the second quarter of 2023 and year
over year growth in U.S. real GDP of 2.5% in the second
quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists
of high-quality securities. At March 31, 2022, the Treasury
and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance for
credit losses, was $677.5 billion, and the average credit
rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+
(based upon external ratings where available, and where
not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 32-33 and
Note 9 for further information on the investment securities
portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 67-71 for further information on the
market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 41-45 for further information on
related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to
support underserved communities and minority-owned
businesses.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 133-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
149 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on
pages 138-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR

due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due
to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is
now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) During the period ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated Average and

Maximum Credit portfolio VaR.

(d) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is

not meaningful.

(e) Average and Maximum Corporate and other LOB VaR were driven by a private equity position that became publicly traded at the end of the third quarter of

2020. As of March 31, 2021 the Firm no longer held this position.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR increased by $26 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 when compared with
December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by Credit
portfolio VaR, predominantly due to the effects of nickel price
increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market, as
well as increased volatility in fixed income and commodities
impacting CIB trading VaR.

Year over year results
Average total VaR was $63 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, reflecting the effects of nickel price
increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market
impacting Credit portfolio VaR, as well as increased volatility
in fixed income and commodities impacting CIB trading VaR.
Average total VaR decreased by $43 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022, compared with the same
period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by volatility
which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic rolling
out of the one-year historical look-back period in the first half
of 2021, predominantly impacting exposures in fixed income
and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was
driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions on average five times
every 100 trading days. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 141 of the 261 days, and observed 23 VaR
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 43 of the 64 days,
and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended March 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals.
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income
(Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of
March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected
updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher rates as well as
the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm’s sensitivity to the parallel
and long-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a
greater impact from assets repricing compared to the
impact of liabilities repricing, while the shift in short-term
rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from
liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets
repricing.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario

by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities but also from the
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits,
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer
to the table on page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying
positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many
different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to any such
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,
the time since origination, and other factors which are
updated periodically based on historical experience.
Deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios
include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and
other factors.

70

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as the movement in market
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these
sensitivities.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement
framework:

•

Lending exposures are measured at the total committed
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities
collateral received

• Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with

central and commercial banks

•

Securities financing exposures are measured at their
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value
of all positions, including both long and short positions

•

•

Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair
value of the eligible collateral received

Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair
value of the derivative receivable or payable; reflecting
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory
requirements.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 141-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk
management.

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes
activity with both government and private-sector entities in
a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is
based on the country where the largest proportion of the
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal
residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors
attributed to that country. Activities which result in
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not
included in the country exposure measure (for example,
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to
collateral on securities financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure,
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an
individual country. The use of different measurement
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of
reported country exposure.

72

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2022 and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in
exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash
placements with the central banks of those countries driven
by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.

As of March 31, 2022, exposure to Russia, based on the
Firm's internal country risk measurement framework, was
approximately $650 million. This largely reflects cross-
border lending activity, net of the allowance for credit
losses, to Russian corporate clients.

Cybersecurity Risk
The Firm faces increased risk of cyber attacks due to
potential retaliation for the sanctions imposed as a result of
the war in Ukraine. The Firm has implemented additional
precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed
to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat
monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures
taken by the Firm to protect against cybersecurity breaches
will provide absolute security against cyber attacks.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems,
human factors, or external events impacting the Firm’s
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business disruptions (including those caused by
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control),
cyberattacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to
comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure
of vendors or other third party providers to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position,
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 143-149 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of the
Firm’s Operational Risk Management. Details on other
select examples of operational risks are provided below.

In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous sanctions have
been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and
individuals by various governments around the world,
including the authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU.
These sanctions are complex and evolving at a rapid pace in
response to the war. The Firm faces increased operational
risk associated with interpreting and maintaining these
complex compliance programs. To manage this increased
risk, the Firm has implemented additional controls
reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance
and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in
property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict
payments as required by the applicable regulations.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services,
cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event
beyond its control that may impact critical business
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology,
facilities and third parties). The program includes
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2021 Form 10-K for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-65 and
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of MEVs that are relevant for exposures across
the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily
by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.5% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly
3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a
peak difference of approximately 7.0% in the fourth
quarter of 2022; and lower national HPI with a peak
difference of 20.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including:

• The Firm increased the weight placed on the adverse

scenarios in estimating the allowance for credit losses as
of March 31, 2022, and accordingly, the existing
allowance reflects credit losses beyond those estimated
under the central scenario.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables.

75

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition

and borrower behavior can significantly affect the
allowance for credit losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2022, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering
offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative
components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the
comparison between these two scenarios for the lending
exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $600 million for residential

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.4 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $2.8 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2022.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including,
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for
further information.

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total

of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on
page 152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant valuation judgments
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
March 31, 2022.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $10.1 billion and $9.8
billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page
152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on pages 152-153 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances,
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts,
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain
factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in
the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and political
conditions and geopolitical events, including the war in
Ukraine;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,

including capital and liquidity requirements affecting the
Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to address
those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and

scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices, including
dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including changes

in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending or

savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its capital and

liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or its

subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,

environmental and sustainability concerns that may arise,
including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an economic
slowdown or other economic or market disruption,
including, but not limited to, in the interest rate
environment;

79

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its

counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue products and
services, and the extent to which products or services
previously sold by the Firm require the Firm to incur

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments
have been included such that this interim financial
information is fairly stated.

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances
where it has determined that the specified conditions are
met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K
for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.

85

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets,
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

86

The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, by

(a) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $72.8 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-

related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

88

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be

classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $845 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, were trading assets of $45 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $800 million and $750 million, respectively.
(e) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, included $15.1 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $9.3 billion
and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the
intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $5.0 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of
such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable
components (that is, components that are actively quoted
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs
are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that
the input is being used to value.

In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $286 million, nonagency securities of $10 million and non-trading loans of $987 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $10 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-trading loans of $345 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $1.0 billion and non-trading loans of $740 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $850 million including $187 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

90

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of
the underlying instruments and external market factors that
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s
positions.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in
fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. When a
determination is made to classify a financial instrument
within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair
value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table
below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2
risk management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to
such level 3 instruments.

(a) Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 2% and
2% at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Level 3 liabilities at fair value as a percentage of total Firm liabilities at fair value (including
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 9% and 10% at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

93

(b) All level 3 derivatives are presented on a net basis, irrespective of the underlying counterparty.
(c) Predominantly reported in principal transactions revenue, except for changes in fair value for CCB mortgage loans and lending-related commitments

originated with the intent to sell, and mortgage loan purchase commitments, which are reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Realized gains/(losses) on AFS securities are reported in investment securities gains/(losses). Unrealized gains/(losses) are reported in OCI. There were no

realized gains/(losses) recorded in income on AFS securities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unrealized gains/
(losses) recorded on AFS securities in OCI were $27 million and zero for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(e) Changes in fair value for MSRs are reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(f) Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue, and were not material for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI, and were $(229) million and $(22) million for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(g) Loan originations are included in purchases.
(h) Includes financial assets and liabilities that have matured, been partially or fully repaid, impacts of modifications, deconsolidations associated with

beneficial interests in VIEs and other items.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2021, for those items measured at fair
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 95
for further information on changes impacting items
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Three months ended March 31, 2022
Level 3 assets were $22.0 billion at March 31, 2022,
reflecting an increase of $4.5 billion from December 31,
2021.

The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2022
was largely driven by:

• $1.0 billion increase in gross interest rate derivative

receivables due to gains.

• $1.8 billion increase in MSRs.

Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair
value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended March 31, 2022, significant
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:

• $1.2 billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely

due to equity securities of $853 million driven by a
decrease in observability as a result of restricted access
to certain markets.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3
into level 2.

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/
or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in
which they occur.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods
indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s
risk management activities where the financial instruments
are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value
measurements rollforward tables on pages 91-94 for
further information on these instruments.

Three months ended March 31, 2022

• $2.0 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven

by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to
market movements and MSRs reflecting lower
prepayment speeds on higher rates.

• $2.2 billion of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by
gains in long-term debt due to market movements.

Three months ended March 31, 2021

• $984 million of net gains on assets, driven by MSRs
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates.

• $528 million of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by

market movements in long-term debt.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on MSRs.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives
The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $802 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2022, $754 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $417 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2022, $34 million related to residential real estate

loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are
valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with
actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 51% with a weighted average of 24%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative),
with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of March
31, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the
periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair
value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a
nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa
Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6181 at March 31, 2022, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as
follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without
notice. Refer to page 171 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets,
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise

be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded
derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are
carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information
presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk
management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI,
while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in
principal transactions revenue were $(8) million and $(2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value
option was elected was $11.7 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $56 million and $10
million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further
information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.

The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited
number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as
derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or
for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure
category.

(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional

derivative contracts.

While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity,
the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s
view, the possible losses that could arise from such
transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional
amount is not exchanged; it is simply a reference amount
used to calculate payments.

(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and

payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.

103

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained,
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are
shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown

separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of

the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade),
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate

risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the table above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the

inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item; prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(g) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $24.9 billion and $25.7 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to which

the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income
in future periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not

reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is
$14.6 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $1.4 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive
(negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and
2021.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $139 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at
March 31, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated,
the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately
eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the
maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees
and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic
hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than
the notional amount of protection sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of

protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

the identical reference instrument.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives
as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is
based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the
reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where
JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 9 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management
activities. At March 31, 2022, the investment securities
portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit
rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available,
and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings).

In April 2022, the Firm transferred $65.9 billion of
investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital
management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized
losses of $4.7 billion on the securities at the date of
transfer.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding the investment securities
portfolio.

The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.

HTM securities – credit risk
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the
risk rating assigned to each security. At both March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, all HTM securities were
rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 98% rated at least AA+.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was
$41 million and $94 million as of March 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 7 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 5 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been
elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities
financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021. When the Firm has obtained
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but

such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other
assets and the obligation to return those securities within
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Firm held $415 million and $440 million, respectively, of financial assets for
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in
trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

121

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following
categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding
credit card
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)

Credit card

Wholesale(c)(d)

• Credit card loans

• Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business banking and auto dealer loans for which the

wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral,

purpose, and type of borrower.

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
more information on SPEs.

The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools
as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable
requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $3.2 billion and $7.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are

predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related
commitments (including adjustments to record loans and
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of
cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 was $38 million of
which $34 million related to loans. Net gains on sales of
loans and lending-related commitments was $132 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 of which
$135 million  related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans
may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the
allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Loan modifications
The majority of the Firm's COVID-19 related loan
modifications were not considered TDRs. Refer to Note 12
of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on the Firm's accounting policies for loan
modifications.

123

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans,
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market.
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only
payment period and certain payment-option loans that may
result in negative amortization.

consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $30 million and

$35 million; 30–149 days past due included $13 million and $11 million; and 150 or more days past due included $22 million and $20 million at
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

(b) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within

their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $35 million

and $31 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in
accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower
(“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7
residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-

dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying
collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $45 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured
and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum,
quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and
forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based

on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2022.
(k) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $65 million and $66 million, respectively. These

amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

126

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm
grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs.  The carrying value of new TDRs was $118 million
and $251 million for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real
estate loans have been modified in TDRs.

Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various concessions to financially
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise
have been required under the terms of the original
agreement. The following table provides information about
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs
under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions.

exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are
generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of
residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans
modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications
and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where
the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction.
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At March 31, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in
TDRs were 5 years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure
At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.
government agencies, with a carrying value of $767 million and $619 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but
were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

SBA that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the SBA guarantee.

(b) Includes $2.5 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $353 million of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are

guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an
allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(c) Includes $4.4 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $1.0 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.
(d) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Loan modifications
Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to
be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,
were not material to the Firm for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021. Additional commitments to lend
to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were not
material.

(a) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loans

excluded $179 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90
or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which
$163 million and $35 million, respectively, were no longer accruing
interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal
balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified
reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA.
There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90
or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In

accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves
subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be
negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was
not material for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on

the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2022.

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans
originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates
are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card
loans.

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on the credit card loan portfolio,
including credit quality indicators.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than
1% of total retained credit card loans.

(b) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default

in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they
defaulted.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified
credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s
standard charge-off policy.

132

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small
businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating
assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information on these risk ratings.

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained
wholesale loans.

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically

occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing
financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs. New TDRs were $418 million and $428 million as of March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. New TDRs for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 reflected extending maturity dates, covenant waivers and the receipt of assets in
partial satisfaction of the loan predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial loan class.  The impact of these modifications
resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

The carrying value of TDRs was $906 million and $607 million as of March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments.
Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2021 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and
the related accounting policies.

(a) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific allowance for credit card loans modified, or reasonably expected to be
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) At March 31, 2022 and 2021, lending-related commitments excluded $15.3 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit
card portfolio segment; $757.3 billion and $674.4 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $32.9 billion and $39.6 billion,
respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

137

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2022 was
$19.6 billion, an increase from $18.7 billion at
December 31, 2021, consisting of: $776 million in
wholesale, across the LOBs, and $127 million in consumer,
driven by the residential real estate portfolio.

The change in the allowance largely reflects an increased
weight placed on the adverse scenarios, from the more
balanced weighting placed on the adverse and upside
scenarios at December 31, 2021, due to the potential
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including the
war in Ukraine. The increase in the allowance also included
client-specific Russia and Russia-associated downgrades in
CIB and AWM.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a
weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates
above 4% through the second quarter of 2023 and year
over year growth in U.S. real GDP of 2.5% in the second
quarter of 2023.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(b) As of March 31, 2022, the year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in

change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is
considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-
sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust.

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial
interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal
amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The
Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent
basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $68
million and $131 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The retained interests in

Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$13.3 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively,
which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity
and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$13.8 billion and $13.4 billion at March 31, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of
JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion at March 31, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, respectively.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing

142

member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $26.5
billion and $26.8 billion, of which $9.0 billion and $9.4
billion was unfunded at March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its
capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.
Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on affordable housing tax credits and
Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders
for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at  March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021 was $7.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The
fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021 was $10.3 billion and $10.5
billion, respectively.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,
and commercial mortgages.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31,
2022 and 2021, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and
where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

(e) Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for
additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured
or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to
Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

As of March 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic
conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as
actual business results and projections of business
performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31,
2022, or December 31, 2021, nor was goodwill written off
due to impairment during the three months ended
March 31, 2022 or 2021.

145

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further description of the
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

(c) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a
short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a
particular assumption may have on the fair value is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the
impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Note 20 – Restricted cash and other restricted
assets
Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other
restricted assets.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s

supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for
BHC and IDI subsidiaries, respectively.

(b) The Federal Reserve's regulations do not establish well-capitalized

CECL regulatory capital transition
On December 31, 2021, the CECL capital transition
provisions,	which delayed the effects of CECL on regulatory
capital for two years, expired. Beginning January 1, 2022,
the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of
December 31, 2021, will be phased out at 25% per year
over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2022, CET1
capital reflected the remaining 75%, or $2.2 billion,
benefit associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased
out 25% of the other relevant CECL capital transition
provisions recognized as of December 31, 2021, from Tier
2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage
exposure.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
further information on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to
0% by the federal banking agencies.

(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The

CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI
subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.

(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to

regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the
Firm’s related accounting policies.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments.

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The amounts
in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain
scored business banking lending-related commitments
represent the total available credit for these products. The
Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all
available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card
and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60
days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of
the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.
(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.
(d) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $51 million and $44 million,

respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees; and $660 million and $451 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments
are shown gross of risk participations.

(e) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $387.6 billion
and $357.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and
government agencies.

(f) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program

and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(g) At March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, unfunded commitments

related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, and other equity investment commitments.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-

related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in

several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to
Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further
information on these derivatives.

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying
as guarantees as of March 31, 2022, and December 31,

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-
backs.

157

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house
therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 156. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2021 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 156 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form
10-K for additional information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.

Pledged assets
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

Collateral
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation

Contingencies
As of March 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.4 billion at March 31, 2022. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase
entities into residential housing projects developed by the
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately
$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine.
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P.
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major
international oil companies. The account held
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was
unsuccessful. A trial was held between February and April
2022, and the parties are awaiting the Court's decision.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year

159

exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its
affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm
will need the Department of Labor to approve a further
exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year
disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only
remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa
Competition Commission matter which is currently pending
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on
futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed
requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and
certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other
foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of
these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class
action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign
exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates.
Another putative class action was brought against the Firm
and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported
indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court
approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants
of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition,
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based
on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the
Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. In a putative class action
pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, the
tribunal has denied a request by the proposed class
representatives for class certification on an opt-out basis.

Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements. In
December 2021 certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries entered
into resolutions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to resolve their respective
civil investigations of compliance with records preservation
requirements applicable to broker-dealer firms, swap
dealers and futures commission merchants. The SEC and
CFTC found that J.P. Morgan Securities LLC did not maintain
copies of certain communications required to be maintained
under their respective record keeping rules, where such
communications were sent or received by employees over
electronic messaging channels that had not been approved
for employee use by the Firm. The CFTC resolution also
included JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities plc as swap dealers. The SEC and CFTC also found
related supervision failures. Under these resolutions, J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC paid a $125 million civil monetary
penalty to the SEC, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc
paid a total $75 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC.
The Firm continues to respond to requests for information
and other material from certain authorities concerning its
compliance with records preservation requirements in
connection with business communications sent over
electronic messaging channels that have not been approved
by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.

In March 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York against the Firm’s Board of Directors asserting
breaches of fiduciary duty and violation of federal securities
laws based on the Board’s alleged failure to exercise
adequate oversight over compliance with records
preservation requirements.  The complaint seeks damages,
restitution, disgorgement and corporate governance
reforms.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants
collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the
approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court.
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in
part, and denied the motion in part.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the

160

world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards.
Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. In
December 2021, the court denied plaintiffs’ motions for a
preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from
setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and enforcing any financial
instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm’s
settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc
LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the
Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill
Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and
Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective
investigations relating to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S.
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to
2016.

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after
three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan

Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully
comply with all of their obligations.

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the
total monetary amount includes victim compensation
payments.

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Firm and certain former employees,
alleging a precious metals futures and options price
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions, and, in December
2021, the Court preliminarily approved a settlement among
the parties. In addition, several putative class actions were
filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern
District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against
the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and
options, and bringing claims under the Commodity
Exchange Act. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois
were transferred to the Southern District of New York. The
Court consolidated these putative class actions, and, in
December 2021, the Court preliminarily approved a
settlement among the parties. In Canada, plaintiffs have
moved to commence putative class action proceedings
based on similar alleged underlying conduct related to
precious metals.

In October 2020, two putative class action complaints were
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their
second amended complaint in May 2021, which additionally
alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures
contracts placed by precious metals futures traders during
the putative class period were materially false and
misleading. Defendants have moved to dismiss.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.

161

Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants are opposing.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $119 million and
$28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance that the
Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the
future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are
determined based on the products and services provided, or
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in
which financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the three months ended March
31, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
Segment results and reconciliation(a)
Consumer &
Community Banking

Corporate &
Investment Bank

reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and
as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of
the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

May 3, 2022

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of March 31, 2022, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income and changes
in stockholders’ equity for the three-month periods ended
March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 and the consolidated
statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “interim financial
statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of
any material modifications that should be made to the
accompanying interim financial statements for them to be
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of
the Firm as of December 31, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the
year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report
dated February 22, 2022, which included a paragraph
describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit
losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
information as of December 31, 2021, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide
through the commercial card products. Services include
procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense
management services, and business-to-business payment
solutions.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include,
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to
the protection seller for the difference between the face

criteria

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However,
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

EPS: Earnings per share

ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974

ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance

ETD: “Exchange-traded derivatives”: Derivative contracts

LCR: Liquidity coverage ratio

LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate

LLC: Limited Liability Company

LOB: Line of business

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to present
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management
also uses this financial measure at the segment level,
because it believes this provides information to enable
investors to understand the underlying operational
performance and trends of the particular business segment
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with
the performance of competitors.

Markets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity
Markets businesses.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the

without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics,
and other payments services. Through Merchant Services,
merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and
debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

Prime
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

168

Subprime
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period
presented.

Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained
loans for the reporting period.

Net interchange income includes the following
components:

•

Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit
card issuers on sales transactions.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by
cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs
generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for
interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically
maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only
exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs, which
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock
and participating securities, based on their respective rights
to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar”
approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital
requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and
prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar”
approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through
disclosure requirements which allow market participants to
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association ("SBA")

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer
spread, which is the difference between the price at which
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and
the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and
losses on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in

169

client-driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

PSU(s): Performance share units

RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced.

reference pool of loans or other market variables. The notes
typically contain embedded (but not separable or
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates
or indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results,
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities; the corresponding income tax
impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within
income tax expense.

quasi-governmental, privately-held entities established or
chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes
as specified by the U.S. Congress to improve the flow of

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-
star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of
industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is
derived from a weighted average of the performance
associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled
funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on
three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with
fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer

173

categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage
of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for
U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for
Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and
five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers.
Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and
associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and
Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the
oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.

Refer to the Market Risk Management section of
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 133-140
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting” on page 156 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2021 Form 10-K for further information. There was
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three
months ended March 31, 2022, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.
