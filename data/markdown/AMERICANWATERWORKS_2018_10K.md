ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our Company

PART I

With a history dating back to 1886 , American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company
in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936 , we employ
approximately 7,100 professionals  who provide  drinking  water,  wastewater  and  other  related  services  to  more  than  14 million people in 46 states and Ontario,
Canada. We conduct the majority of our business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as our “ Regulated
Businesses  .”  We  also  operate  market-based  businesses  that  provide  a  broad  range  of  related  and  complementary  water,  wastewater  and  other  services.
Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as our Market-Based Businesses , which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

Throughout this Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American
Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without
its subsidiaries.

Regulated Businesses

Our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority,
fire  service  and  sale  for  resale  customers.  Our  utilities  operate  in  approximately  1,600 communities  in  16 states  in  the  United  States,  with  approximately  3.4
million active  customers  to our  water  and wastewater  networks.  Services  provided  by  our utilities  are  generally  subject  to economic  regulation  by certain  state
utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs” or “Regulators”). Certain federal,
state and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We report the results of the services provided by our utilities
in our Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for our Regulated Businesses were $2,984 million for 2018 , $2,958 million for 2017 and $2,871 million
for 2016 , accounting for 87% , 88% and 87% , respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

Customers

Our Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other
entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase our services for use by
multiple individuals or businesses, as is the case in many homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.

The vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage, typically on a monthly
basis. We employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where
consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio
frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. Our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.

Residential customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate. We also serve (i) commercial customers,
such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where we supply water
through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings
and  other  facilities,  (iii)  industrial  customers,  such  as  large-scale  manufacturers,  mining  and  production  operations,  (iv)  public  authorities,  such  as  government
buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of
bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater, for their own customers.

Customer  growth  in  our  Regulated  Businesses  is  primarily  from  (i)  adding  new  customers  to  our  customer  base  through  acquisitions  of  water  and/or
wastewater  utility  systems,  (ii)  organic  population  growth  in  our  authorized  service  areas,  and  (iii)  sale  of  water  to  other  water  utilities  and  community  water
systems.

Capital Investment

The aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States is in need of replacement and modernization. The American Society of Civil Engineers
published its Report
Card
for
America’s
Infrastructure
in 2017 and gave the drinking water industry a grade of “D,” and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of
“D+,” primarily because much of the country’s infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. The report also stated that, on an annual basis, approximately 2
trillion  gallons  of  treated  water  are  lost  in  the  United  States  through  more  than  240,000  main  breaks,  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $2.6  billion  .  This  represents
approximately 20% of all treated water in the country. In addition, approximately 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into the country’s rivers
and streams every year. As documented in the American Water Works Association’s Buried
No
Longer:
Confronting
America’s
Water
Infrastructure
Challenge
,
restoring the country’s existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives, and expanding them to serve a growing population, will cost at least $1
trillion between 2011 and 2035, just to maintain the current levels of water service. In addition, increased regulation related to water quality and the management of
water  and  wastewater  residual  discharges,  which  began  with  the  passage  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  in  1972  and  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  in  1974,  is  also  a
primary driver for the need to modernize the country’s water and wastewater infrastructure.

To address the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve, we plan to invest $7.3 billion over the next five years, including $1.6 billion in 2019, for
capital improvements to our Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater
treatment facilities. We have proactively improved our pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle to a 120-year replacement cycle, which we anticipate
will  enable  us  to  replace  nearly  2,000  miles  of  mains  and  collection  pipes  between  2019  and  2023.  In  addition,  during  this  same  five-year  period,  our  capital
investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities has increased over 10%, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency,
water  quality,  operational  efficiency,  technology  and  innovation,  and  emerging  regulatory  compliance  needs.  Additionally,  we  are  investing  significantly  in
resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening our assets.

Economic Regulation and Rate Making

Our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  under  a  regulatory  compact  whereby,  in  exchange  for  exclusive  rights  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  in
defined service territories, we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service, within reasonable limits. In return for agreeing to
invest capital into our water and wastewater systems, we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on
our investments.

The  operations  of  our  Regulated  Businesses  are  generally  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  PUCs  in  the  state  in  which  they  operate,  with  the  primary
responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from
state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital,
O&M  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,  reorganizations  and  mergers  and  acquisitions,  along  with  imposing  certain
penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as
well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

5

Table of Contents

The process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the PUC on a periodic basis. The timing
of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement
to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. Our rate case management program is guided by the
principles  of  (i)  obtaining  timely  recovery  of  capital  investment  costs,  (ii)  recognizing  declining  sales  resulting  from  reduced  consumption,  and  (iii)  obtaining
appropriate recovery of utility O&M costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. The program attempts to minimize “regulatory
lag,” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates. For example,
regulatory lag describes the time between when a capital investment is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and when the Company can begin earning
a return of and on that capital investment, through the ratemaking process. It also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses and
revenues.

Our Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. The following

table provides examples of approved regulatory practices:

Description

Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to
replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe, reliable services for our customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic
filings and reviews to ensure transparency.
A test period used for setting rates, which begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues,
expenses and capital investments to be collected on a timelier basis.

funds  used  during  construction.  In  addition,  some  states  allow  the  utility  to  seek  pre-approval  of  certain  capital  projects  and
associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.
Allows  changes  in  certain  operating  expenses,  which  may  fluctuate  based  on  conditions  beyond  the  utility’s  control,  to  be
recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.
Separates  a  utility’s  cost  recovery  from  the  amount  of  water  it  sells  to  recover  its  fixed  costs  and  ongoing  infrastructure
investment needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its
costs, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing
an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.
Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically
interconnected.  The  consolidated  tariff  pricing  structure  may  be  used  fully  or  partially  in  a  state,  and  is  generally  used  to
prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs
for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.

We  pursue  or  seek  enhancement  to  these  regulatory  practices  to  facilitate  efficient  recovery  of  our  costs  and  capital  investments  in  order  to  continue  to
provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to our customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCs
will  accept  our  proposal  in  the  context  of  a  particular  rate  case,  and  these  regulatory  practices  may  reduce,  but  not  eliminate,  regulatory  lag  associated  with
traditional rate making processes. It is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply.

Acquisitions and Strategic Growth

The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments
or governmental subdivisions. Both industries are highly fragmented. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), approximately 84% of the
water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates that
there are approximately 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80%
of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less. This large number of relatively small, fragmented water and wastewater systems may result
in  inefficiencies  in  the  marketplace,  since  such  utilities  may  not  have  the  operating  expertise,  financial  and  technological  capability  or  economies  of  scale  to
provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. Larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated
and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems. In addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases, spread
across broad geographic regions, may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures, such as droughts, excessive rain
and cool or warm temperatures in specific areas. Larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base, thereby reducing the
costs to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale, companies that participate
in  industry  consolidation  have  the  potential  to  improve  operating  efficiencies,  lower  costs  per  unit  and  improve  service  at  the  same  time.  Larger  utilities  also
typically have the expertise to operate systems more efficiently and can attract and retain employees needed to operate the utility over time.

A fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems of between 3,000 and 30,000
customers, in geographic proximity to areas where we operate our Regulated Businesses . The proximity of acquisition  opportunities to our regulated footprint
allows  us  to  integrate  and  manage  the  acquired  systems  and  operations  primarily  using  our  existing  management,  although  we  typically  retain  the  majority  of
employees,  and  to  achieve  operational  efficiencies  and  prioritize  capital  investment  needs.  Our  current  customer  mix  of  94%  water  and  6%  wastewater  also
presents  strategic  opportunities  for  wastewater  growth  and  systems  consolidation,  allowing  us  to  add  wastewater  customers  where  we  already  serve  water
customers.  We  intend  to  continue  to  expand  our  regulated  footprint  geographically  by  acquiring  water  and  wastewater  systems  in  our  existing  markets  and,  if
appropriate,  pursuing  acquisition  opportunities  in  certain  domestic  markets  where  we  do  not  currently  operate  our  Regulated Businesses .  Before  entering  new
regulated markets, we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our
investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers, as well as a line of sight to grow our base
customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.

Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment,

financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.

We are an experienced utility with proven access to capital and financial, technical, and managerial resources with public service commission oversight. We

are a solution provider and believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service.

Industry Legislation

In  2017,  New  Jersey  enacted  the  Water  Quality  Accountability  Act  (the  “WQAA”),  which  sets  new  operational  standards  for  all  water  utilities  in  New
Jersey,  including  municipal  and  investor-owned  utilities  with  more  than  500  service  connections.  This  law  imposes  new  requirements  in  areas  such  as
cybersecurity, asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most
senior water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water
systems, to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. On October 19, 2018, our New Jersey American Water subsidiary certified that it was
in compliance with all aspects of the Act.

In 2018, similar legislation was passed in Indiana, which sets new operational standards and requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants in areas

such as capital asset management, cost-benefit analysis and cybersecurity.

Also,  in  2018,  President  Trump  signed  America’s  Water  Infrastructure  Act  of  2018.  The  legislation  includes  policies  intended  to  improve  water  and
wastewater  system  management  and  authorization  for  states  to  assess  options  for  consolidation  for  systems  that  do  not  comply  with  the  federal  Safe  Drinking
Water Act and its rules and regulations. The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs, including the State Revolving Loan Fund program
and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act.

Our  regulated  subsidiaries  in  California,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa,  Maryland,  Missouri,  New  Jersey  and  Pennsylvania  have  access  to  fair  market  value
legislation  for  private  sector  investment  in  public  sector  systems.  We  support  full  optionality  for  municipalities,  including  state  legislation  that  enables  the
consolidation  of  the  largely  fragmented  water  and  wastewater  industries  through  third-party  fair  market  valuations  of  purchased  property.  Fair  market  value
assessment  of  water  and  wastewater  systems  is  an  alternative  to  the  traditional  depreciated  original  cost  method  of  valuation,  providing  municipalities  with  a
purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets, subject to
state regulatory commission approval.

Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.
Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state.
As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of
systems  and  prioritize  capital  needs  across  the  state.  Overall,  this  brings  cost-effective,  higher  quality  services  to  a  larger  number  of  citizens.  Eleven  of  our
regulated subsidiaries currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.

In  2018,  legislation  was  passed  in  our  Missouri  and  California  subsidiaries  changing  the  public  vote  requirement  for  the  sale  of  water  or  wastewater
systems. In Missouri, the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small
towns. Historically, only larger communities required a simple majority, while smaller communities needed a two-thirds majority. This legislation increases the
options for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale. In California, the vote required to allow cities to sell
sewer systems changed to a simple majority as compared to a two-thirds majority.

Competition

In  our  Regulated  Businesses  ,  we  generally  do  not  face  direct  competition  in  our  existing  markets  because  (i)  we  operate  in  those  markets  pursuant  to
franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs, and (ii) the high cost
of  constructing  a  new  water  and  wastewater  system  in  an  existing  market  creates  a  high  barrier  to  market  entry.  However,  our  Regulated  Businesses  do face
competition  from  governmental  agencies,  other  investor-owned  utilities,  large  industrial  customers  with  the  ability  to  provide  their  own water  supply/treatment
process  and  strategic  buyers  that  are  entering  new  markets  and/or  making  strategic  acquisitions.  When  pursuing  acquisitions,  our  largest  investor-owned
competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Aqua America, Inc., Suez North America, American States Water Company
and California Water Service Group. From time to time, we also face competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin
Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy and Corix.

Condemnation and Eminent Domain

All or portions of our Regulated Businesses ’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the
following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when
the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from
which  it  received  its  CPCN.  The  acquisition  consideration  related  to  such  a  proceeding  initiated  by  a  local  government  may  be  determined  consistent  with
applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.

As such, we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California
successfully added “Measure J” to the November 6, 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the
“MPWMD”) should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of our California subsidiary’s Monterey water service assets, and, if feasible, to
proceed  with a purchase  of those assets  without  an additional  public  vote. This service  territory  represents  approximately  40,000 customers.  On November  27,
2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. The MPWMD has until August 27, 2019 to complete a feasibility study and submit to its board a written plan for
acquiring  the  system  assets.  If  the  MPWMD  were  to  determine  that  such  an  acquisition  is  feasible,  then  the  MPWMD  would  commence  a  multi-year  eminent
domain proceeding against our California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMD’s right to take the system assets and, if such right is established, determine the
amount of just compensation to be paid for the system assets.

Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit
against  our  Illinois  subsidiary  in  January  2013,  seeking  to  condemn  the  water  pipeline  that  serves  those  five  municipalities.  Before  filing  its  eminent  domain
lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline. Although the date of this
trial has not currently been scheduled, it is likely to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Furthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property
owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage
to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, most recently, lawsuits have been filed
in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that
resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in
other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the
utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.

Water Supply and Wastewater Services

Our Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to our customers and collect, treat, transport and
recycle wastewater. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts, permits and allocation rights
granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. We are dependent on defined sources of water
supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers;
and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source
and  customer  stipulations.  Surface  water  sources  typically  generally  require  significant  treatment,  while  groundwater  sources  often  require  chemical  treatment
only.

The following chart depicts our sources of water supply as of December 31, 2018 :

Our  ability  to  meet  the  existing  and  future  water  demands  of  our  customers  depends  on  an  adequate  water  supply.  Drought,  governmental  restrictions,
overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water.
We employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity
of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service
territory.  For  example,  in  any  given  summer,  some  areas  may  experience  drier  than  average  weather,  which  may  reduce  the  amount  of  source  water  available,
while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather.

Table of Contents

In  our  long-term  planning,  we  evaluate  quality,  quantity,  growth  needs  and  alternate  sources  of  water  supply  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution
capacity. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that we have adequate water supply,
we use long-term planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of
weather  fluctuations.  In  connection  with  supply  planning  for  most  surface  or  groundwater  sources,  we  employ  models  to  determine  safe  yields  under  different
rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted
and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of our use of long-term planning to ensure that we have adequate
water supply is our involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes
the construction of a desalination plant, owned by our California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In
addition, the Water Supply Project also includes our California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project between the Monterey
Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (now known as Monterey One Water) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to
fulfill obligations of our California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water
Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings —Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions.

Wastewater  services  involve  the  collection  of  wastewater  from  customers’  premises  through  sewer  lines.  The  wastewater  is  then  transported  through  a
sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid
waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.

Seasonality

Customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall. Customer
demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, we
typically  expect  our  operating  revenues  to  be  the  highest  in  the  third  quarter  of  each  year.  Weather  that  is  hotter  and  drier  than  average  generally  increases
operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating
revenues.  Three  of  our  jurisdictions,  California,  Illinois  and  New  York,  have  adopted  revenue  stability  mechanisms  which  permit  us  to  collect  state  PUC-
authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See “
Economic Regulation and Rate Making ” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.

Market-Based Businesses

Through our Market-Based Businesses , we provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services primarily to residential and
smaller commercial customers, the U.S. government on military installations and shale natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as municipalities,
utilities  and  industrial  customers.  These  businesses  are  not  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  the  services  provided  generally  do  not  require
significant capital investment. Operating revenues for our Market-Based Businesses were $476 million for 2018 , $422 million for 2017 and $451 million for 2016
, accounting for 14% , 13% and 14% , respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

Our primary Market-Based Businesses include the following operating segments:

•

•

•

Homeowner Services Group , which provides various warranty protection programs to residential and smaller commercial customers;

Military  Services  Group  ,  which  enters  into  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  to  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  on  various
military installations; and

Keystone  Clearwater  Solutions,  LLC  (“Keystone”),  which  provides  customized  water  transfer  services  for  shale  natural  gas  exploration  and
production companies.

We also enter into contracts with municipal, commercial and industrial customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other
related services through our Contract Services Group . During 2018, we closed on the sale of the majority of our Contract Services Group ’s O&M contracts to
subsidiaries  of  Veolia  Environnement  S.A.  See  Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
information. We will retain four of our Contract Services Group ’s O&M contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas, and expect the majority of
the remaining contracts to be sold to other parties, or expire within the next twelve months.

Table of Contents

Homeowner Services Group

Our  Homeowner  Services  Group  ,  which  includes  our  June  4,  2018  acquisition  of  Pivotal  Home  Solutions  (“Pivotal”),  provides  warranty  protection
programs to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior gas and electric
lines,  heating  and  cooling  systems,  water  heaters  and  other  home  appliances,  as  well  as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  We  also  develop
partnerships with municipalities, utilities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by, or affiliated with, those municipalities,
utilities and organizations. The term of these partnership agreements is typically three to five years, with mutual optional renewals. As of December 31, 2018 , our
Homeowner Services Group had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states, and 26 partnership agreements with utilities, municipalities  and other
organizations.

Military Services Group

Our Military  Services  Group  operates  on  14 military  installations  under  50-year  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  as  part  of  its  Utility  Privatization
Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program
focused  on  asset  replacement  and,  in  certain  instances,  systems  expansion.  The  replacement  of  assets  assumed  when  a  contract  is  awarded  to  the  Company  is
funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the U.S.
government  as  separate  modifications  or  amendments  to  the  contract.  The  capital  program  historically  has  not  used  the  Company’s  equity  or  debt  borrowings;
rather, we have used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must
offer financing in its proposal for a new capital project. The Company is currently exploring strategies to address the U.S. Army’s revised requirements for new
projects on which it may seek to bid, including partnering with third parties for off-balance sheet financing.

The contract price for nine of our contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every
three  years  thereafter.  Price  redetermination  is  a  contract  mechanism  to  periodically  adjust  the  service  fee  in  the  next  period,  to  reflect  changes  in  contract
obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining five contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism
similar to price redetermination called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year
term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to
termination provisions applicable to these contracts, we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract
profit margin on incurred costs. Our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $4.3 billion , with an average
remaining contract term of 42 years.

Keystone

In July 2015, we acquired a 95% interest in Water Solutions Holdings, LLC, including its wholly owned subsidiary, Keystone. During 2018, pursuant to the
exercise of put options by the minority owners, we acquired the remaining 5% interest in Keystone, bringing our ownership interest to  100% . Keystone is a water
service and management solutions company that serves shale natural gas exploration and production customers in the Appalachian Basin. During 2018, Keystone
exited  its  construction  and  water  trucking  business  lines,  narrowing  the  scope  of  its  business  going  forward  to  customized  water  transfer  services.  Keystone
operates  under  master  service  agreements  that  are  generally  shorter  term  in  nature.  When  the  initial  term  of  these  agreements  expire,  they  typically  renew
automatically on an annual basis, and are generally cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice. As of December 31, 2018 , Keystone serves approximately
47 customers.

Competition

We face competition in our Market-Based Businesses from a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA in our Homeowner Services Group ,
and American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in our Military Services Group . Keystone currently faces competition
from water service providers that typically provide services to particular segments of the water management cycle, such as Select Energy Services, Inc., TETRA
Technologies, Inc. and Baker Corp.

Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation

Our  water  and  wastewater  operations,  including  the  services  provided  by  both  our  Regulated  Businesses  and Market-Based  Businesses  ,  are  subject  to
extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations, governing the protection of the
environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers, and
the  manner  in  which  we  collect,  treat,  discharge,  recycle  and  dispose  of  wastewater.  In  the  United  States,  these  regulations  are  developed  under  legislation
including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. States also have the authority to develop their
standards and requirements in these areas. We are subject to various federal, state, local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous
materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters
relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver.

Environmental,  health  and  safety,  and  water  quality  regulations  are  complex  and  change  frequently.  For  example,  while  the  EPA  has  issued  a  non-
enforceable  Health  Advisory  for  the  combined  level  of  two  perfluorinated  compounds,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  has  adopted  a
more stringent maximum contaminant level for a third compound, perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and will be seeking to
adopt similar standards for other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The overall trend has been that drinking water standards have become
increasingly  more  stringent  over  time.  As  newer  or  stricter  standards  are  introduced,  our  capital  and  operating  costs  could  increase.  We  incur  substantial  costs
associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which our operations are subject and we invest in technology
solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring. In the past, our Regulated Businesses have generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance;
however,  this  recovery  is  affected  by  regulatory  lag  and  the  corresponding  uncertainties  surrounding  rate  recovery.  We  estimate  that  we  will  make  capital
expenditures of $133 million and $120 million during 2019 and 2020 , respectively, for environmental control facilities, which we define for this purpose as any
project  (or  portion  thereof)  that  involves  the  preservation  of  air,  water  or  land.  We  also  maintain  an  environmental  program  that  includes  responsible  business
practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and effective use of natural resources. We believe that our operations are materially in compliance
with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilities
store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. We also
could  incur  remedial  costs  in  connection  with  any  contamination  relating  to  our  operations  or  facilities  or  our  off-site  disposal  of  wastes.  The  Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental
authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to
present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that
generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard
to  fault,  under  CERCLA  or  comparable  state  laws.  Although  we  are  not  aware  of  any  material  cleanup  or  decontamination  obligations,  the  discovery  of
contamination  or  the  imposition  of  such  obligations  in  the  future  could  result  in  additional  costs.  Our  facilities  and  operations  are  also  subject  to  requirements
under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to
environmental matters. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for additional information.

Safe Drinking Water Act

The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels
of numerous, naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new
rules.  These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  those
contaminants,  and  other  requirements.  To  date,  the  EPA  has  set  standards  for  approximately  90 contaminants  and  indicators  for  drinking  water,  and  there  is  a
process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.

To  help  formulate  the  basis  for  future  regulations,  the  EPA  has  the  authority  to  require  monitoring  for  additional,  unregulated  contaminants  under  the
Unregulated  Contaminant  Monitoring  Rule  (the  “Monitoring  Rule”).  Our  facilities  have  participated  in  the  data  gathering  effort  for  the  Monitoring  Rule  in
previous rounds, which occurs every five years, and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020. There
are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information
and/or treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but we actively participate with the EPA and other
water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Item 1—Business—Research and Development—Emerging Containments
for additional information.

To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking
water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface
Water  Treatment  Rule  and  the  Stage  2  Disinfectants  and  Disinfection  Byproduct  Rule  and  finalized  the  Ground  Water  Rule,  which  is  applicable  to  systems
providing water from underground sources. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels
requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. We are within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with these standards, which includes sample collection,
data analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of our
surface  water  systems  to  provide  additional  protection  against  cryptosporidium.  In  most  cases,  this  will  involve  installing  UV  disinfection  at  an  estimated  cost
ranging from $150 million to $250 million . Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent
chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. We do not anticipate that any such regulations, if
enacted, will require implementation in 2019.

Across the Company, we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous online
instrumentations  such  as  monitoring  turbidity  levels,  disinfectant  residuals  and  adjustments  to  chemical  treatment  based  on  changes  in  incoming  water.  We
participate in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69 of our 81
surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-
assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, we account for approximately one-third
of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 67 of our surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62 plants have
received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 58 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, and 3 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III”
award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of our surface water plants
have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.

Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we expect current requirements
under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have
a material impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been
traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from
these pending or future requirements.

Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act

Across the country, there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water. In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”)
to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public
education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes,
plumbing  fittings  for  fixtures,  solder  and  flux.  While  these  advances  have  made  an  impact  in  reducing  lead  exposure  in  drinking  water,  legacy  lead  plumbing
materials,  primarily  in  building  plumbing,  still  remain  in  many  communities.  The  EPA is  currently  working  to  develop  long-term  revisions  to  the  LCR, with  a
revised  draft  likely  in  2019.  It  is  currently  estimated  that  approximately  5%  of  our  service  lines  contain  lead  (“LSLs”).  We  have  reviewed  our  inventories  of
company owned service lines, our related practices and are working with stakeholders to develop feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines in
older neighborhoods. Our goal is to replace our LSLs in most areas over an approximate 10-year time frame, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2
billion . In cases where we are replacing an American Water owned LSL, our standard approach will be to replace the company-owned portion of the service line,
and work with the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line at the same time. Replacing the full service line is considered a best practice
as advised by the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative and the American Water Works Association. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is
a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer, and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage
communities  to  accelerate  the  full  replacement  of  LSLs  through  collaborative  efforts  at  the  local  level.  The  prioritization  of  this  work  will  depend  on  several
factors,  including  our  planned  water  main  and  service  line  renewal  projects,  adjacent  projects  by  municipalities  or  other  utilities,  LCR  compliance  monitoring
results  and  cooperation  with our  customers  with respect  to the  customer-owned  portion  of the  service  line.  There  is also a  special  focus placed  on low-income
neighborhoods.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to
requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and
implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits
specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and
other compliance  costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost
burdens on our operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. We do not expect any such violations or
fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance

Integrating environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices into our daily operations emphasizes our belief that the only
way to do business is to do it responsibly, and that the “how” is just as important as the “what” for long-term financial sustainability. Being committed to ESG
principles means striving to:

•

•

•

•

•

keep employees safe and injury-free, and develop each person to his or her full potential;

be a leader in environmental sustainability, caring for the planet, and leading the nation in outstanding water safety and quality;

deliver personalized customer service with empathy and care;

make communities better because we are there; and

be transparent, accessible and well-governed for our shareholders and investors.

This  focus  is  derived  from  our  vision  statement,  “clean  water  for  life,”  and  our  core  values:  (i)  safety;  (ii)  trust;  (iii)  environmental  leadership;  (iv)
teamwork;  and  (v)  high  performance,  the  principles  by  which  we  work  and  live.  Our  vision  and  values  drive  our  company  strategy,  which  is  centered  on  five
central themes:

•

•

•

•

•

Safety—The safety of our employees and our customers is the number one focus for American Water.

Customers—Our customers are at the center of everything we do, helping us to shape our strategic priorities. We challenge ourselves so that if our
regulated utility customers had a choice of providers, we would want them to choose us.

People—Maintaining an environment which is open, transparent, diverse and inclusive, and where our people feel valued, included and accountable,
is critical to our ability to serve our customers every day.

Operational Excellence—Our operational excellence strategy helps us to find better and more efficient ways to do business, and to provide safe, clean
and affordable water services for our customers.

Growth—We believe that when companies grow, they can invest more in creating stable jobs, training, benefits, infrastructure and our communities.
Our growth benefits all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.

In 2017, we issued our fourth biennial Corporate Responsibility Report, covering our performance  in 2015 to 2016. Our first report was issued in 2011,
making  us  the  first  large  water  services  company  to  measure  its  performance  against  the  Global  Reporting  Index.  In  addition,  our  sustainability  practices  have
supported our inclusion in the Euronext Vigeo ® U.S. 50 index, FTSE4Good index series, 2018 Constituent MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes, NAACP Equity Inclusion
and  Empowerment  Index  and  the  most  recent  2019  Bloomberg  Gender-Equality  Index.  Highlights  of  our  commitment  to  our  ESG  policies  and  practices  are

15

Table of Contents

We  continue  to  leverage  the  Company’s  expertise  and  collaborate  with  the  EPA  and  state  agencies  to  help  establish  effective  environmental,  health  and
safety, and water quality standards and regulation. This relationship includes the sharing of our research, such as our treatment and distribution system optimization
research  and  our  national  water  quality  monitoring  data.  Our  engagement  with  the  EPA  provides  us  with  early  insight  into  emerging  regulatory  issues  and
initiatives,  thereby  allowing  us  to  anticipate  and  to  accommodate  our  future  compliance  requirements.  We  also  frequently  engage  with  the  Centers  for  Disease
Control and other state environmental agencies. We believe that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as
maintaining  our  leadership  position  in  the  industry,  which  provides  us  with  a  competitive  advantage  as  we  seek  additional  business  with  new  and  existing
customers.

Emerging Contaminants

Emerging contaminants include chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds, as
well as some naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the
public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While these contaminants have been present in our drinking water for as long as they have
been in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has raised
questions among regulators and government agencies, further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality.

The  Chemicals  Abstract  Service  Registry  contains  over  140  million  registered  chemicals,  with  a  new  substance  being  produced  approximately  every  3
seconds  from  chemical  breakdown  and  reformation.  There  are  over  1,400  microbes  which  can  affect  drinking  water.  We  are  continually  investigating  new
substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply, to act on emerging
regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. We maintain state-of-the-art water quality
testing equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of our efforts
include:

•

•

•

•

using our research findings to communicate information to our customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (the Centers for Disease
Control  statistics  indicate  that  water-associated  disease  from  Legionella  is  on  the  rise,  with  exposure  typically  associated  with  customer-owned
plumbing systems in large buildings);

aerial  drone  testing  to  detect  harmful  algal  blooms  and  testing  ultrasonic  technology  to  help  prevent  taste  and  odor  events  and  to  eliminate
cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;

the implementation of water source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and transport through
watersheds and to detect source water contamination events; and

the implementation of activated carbon and biofiltration for the control of emerging contaminants.

Service Company and Security

American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (the “Service Company”) is our wholly owned subsidiary that provides support and operational services to
the Company’s operating subsidiaries. These services are predominantly provided to our Regulated Businesses under contracts that have been approved by PUCs,
where  necessary,  and  are  also  provided  to  our  Market-Based  Businesses  organized  under  American  Water  Enterprises,  LLC,  our  wholly  owned  subsidiary
(“AWE”),  and  Keystone  as  requested  or  may  otherwise  be  necessary.  Services  provided  by  the  Service  Company  may  include  accounting  and  finance,

Employee Matters

As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 49% of our workforce was represented by unions, which include 70 collective bargaining agreements with 15
different unions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018 we had two collective bargaining agreement beyond expiration, affecting approximately 220 employees,
all  of  which  are  actively  working  under  the  terms  of  the  existing  agreement,  and  another  collective  bargaining  agreement  in  its  initial  stage  of  renegotiation,
affecting approximately 140 employees. During 2019 , 18 of our collective bargaining agreements will be expiring in accordance with their terms.

Every five years, we negotiate national health and welfare benefits with our union-represented employees. On July 31, 2018 , a new, five -year national
benefits agreement was ratified, covering approximately 3,200 of our union-represented employees. Highlights of the new agreement include union-represented
employees’ participation in the Company’s cash-based annual performance plan, changes to certain retiree medical benefits and additional medical plan options for
our employees and their families.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

We  operate  in  a  market  and  regulatory  environment  that  involves  significant  risks,  many  of  which  are  beyond  our  control.  In  addition  to  the  other
information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects.
Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows
and liquidity.

Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations

Our  utility  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  economic  regulation  by  state  PUCs  and  other  regulatory  agencies,  which  significantly  affects  our  business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for the inability to
meet these regulatory requirements.

Our Regulated Businesses provide  water  and  wastewater  services  to  our  customers  through  subsidiaries  that  are  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  state
PUCs. Economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations. Generally, the state
PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating
and maintenance costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.

18

Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate
increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or
may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:

•

•

•

cover our expenses, including purchased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;

enable us to recover our investment; and

provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.

Approval of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial
penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvals
and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought
renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities
may have on our business.

In any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient,
we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditions
exist, including, but not limited to, if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than
the level estimated in establishing rates.

Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws
and  regulations,  including  with  respect  to  emerging  contaminants,  compliance  with  which  could  impact  our  operating  costs,  and  violations  of  which  could
subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.

Our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and
regulations and, in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality
of  the  water  we  deliver  to  our  customers,  water  allocation  rights,  and  the  manner  in  which  we  collect,  treat,  discharge  and  dispose  of  wastewater.  These
requirements  include  CERCLA,  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  EPA  requirements  and  similar  federal,  state  and  Canadian  laws  and
regulations.  For  example,  CERCLA  authorizes  the  EPA  to  issue  orders  and  bring  enforcement  actions  to  compel  responsible  parties  to  investigate  and  take
remedial  actions  with  respect  to  actual  or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous  substances,  and  can  impose  joint  and  several  liability,  without  regard  to  fault,  on
responsible parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.

In addition, state PUCs and environmental regulators also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water
or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other
health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the
most serious cases, regulators  could reduce  requested  rate increases  or force us to discontinue  operations and sell our operating  assets to another utility  or to a
municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of,
environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in
the water and wastewater industry.

We  incur  substantial  operating  and  capital  costs  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  comply  with  environmental,  water  quality  and  health  and  safety  laws  and
regulations. These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, generally have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase
our  costs.  Although  we  may  seek  to  recover  ongoing  compliance  costs  in  our  Regulated  Businesses  through  customer  rates,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the
various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or
that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

We  may  also  incur  liabilities  if,  under  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  we  are  required  to  investigate  and  clean  up  environmental  contamination,
including potential spills of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste or caused
an  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  discovery  of  previously  unknown  conditions,  or  the  imposition  of  cleanup  obligations  in  the  future,  could  result  in
significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered by
insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.

Attention is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory
standard  in  drinking  water  or  have  been  recently  created  or  discovered  (including  by  means  of  scientific  achievements  in  the  analysis  and  detection  of  trace
amounts  of  substances).  Examples  of  sources  of  emerging  contaminants  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  newly  created  chemical  compounds  (including,  for
example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, including PFNA, PFOA and other PFAS;
bacteria,  microbes,  viruses,  amoebae  and  other  pathogens;  and  residual  by-products  of  disinfection.  We  rely  upon  governmental  agencies  to  set  appropriate
regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our
states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a
regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or
mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations
and  reputation.  In  addition,  we  believe  emerging  contaminants  may  form  the  basis  for  additional  or  increased  federal  or  state  regulatory  initiatives  and
requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.

Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our
access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.

Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of
public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As a result, we
typically  do  not  own  the  water  that  we  use  in  our  operations,  and  the  availability  of  our  water  supply  is  established  through  allocation  rights  (determined  by
legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements  set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements  set minimum volumes of water that must
pass through specified water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users.
Allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing-flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller
rivers, lakes and streams. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply
issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of
ground and surface water.

For example, in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October
20, 2009 cease and desist order (the “2009 Order”), as amended by an order in July 2016 (the “2016 Order”), of the SWRCB that requires California-American
Water Company, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Cal Am”), to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule
that terminates on December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Deadline”). We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the
requirements of the Endangered Species Act. We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water, or if Cal Am will be exposed
to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order. If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an
alternative source of water, or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows could be adversely affected. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings —Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additional
information regarding this matter.

The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as “regulatory lag,” from the time that we invest in infrastructure
improvements, incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case
applications; our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.

There is typically a delay, known as “regulatory lag,” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating
expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on
the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining
usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

20

Table of Contents

We  endeavor  to  reduce  regulatory  lag  by  pursuing  constructive  regulatory  policies.  For  example,  three  of  our  states  have  approved  revenue  stability
mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of
declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, ten of our state PUCs
permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of
aging  infrastructure.  These  surcharges  are  adjusted  periodically  based  on  factors  such  as  project  completion  or  future  budgeted  expenditures,  and  specific
surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, ten of our state PUCs allow
us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected
in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control,
such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust
rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process.

While these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in
those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue
in  their  current  form,  or  at  all.  Although  we  intend  to  continue  our  efforts  to  expand  state  PUC approval  of  surcharges  to  address  issues  of  regulatory  lag,  our
efforts may not be successful, or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag, in which case our business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.

Changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and liquidity.

New legislation,  regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax
laws,  can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  The  individuals  who  serve  as  regulators  are  elected  or  political  appointees.
Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators
and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy,
including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences,
among others:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;

changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;

restricting  our  ability  to  terminate  our  services  to  customers  who  owe  us  money  for  services  previously  provided  or  limiting  our  bill  collection
efforts;

requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;

limiting  or restricting  our  ability  to acquire  water  or  wastewater  systems,  purchase  or  dispose  of  assets  or  issue securities,  or  making  it less  cost-
effective for us to do so;

negatively impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may be
available, the amount of taxes owed, or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;

changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;

increasing the costs associated with complying with environmental, health, safety and water quality regulations to which our operations are subject;

changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;

making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or
for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;

placing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a
regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;

restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and

revoking or altering the terms of the CPCN issued to us by state PUCs.

21

Table of Contents

Any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

In addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. On
December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other
provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation
and the normalization of deferred income taxes. The enactment of the TCJA required re-measurement of our deferred income taxes, which materially impacted our
2017  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  and  had  a  lesser  impact  on  our  2018  results  of  operations  and  financial  position.  During  2018,  all  of  our  14
jurisdictions subject to economic regulation opened formal proceedings related to the TCJA, and proceedings presently remain open in three of them. Further, the
regulatory treatment of the re-measured deferred income taxes remains open in a number of these jurisdictions. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts on us of
the regulatory treatment  of the TCJA in these open proceedings  or matters,  or of the enactment  or adoption of any Related Interpretations,  if and when issued.
Moreover, we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts, if any, of any other new or amended laws, rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof, to
the extent they may be ultimately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for
our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Service  interruptions  due  to  severe  weather,  climate  variability  patterns  and  other  natural  events  are  possible  across  all  our  businesses.  These  include,
among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal
floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, severe electrical storms and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such
as  these  may  affect  the  condition  or  operability  of  our  facilities,  limiting  or  preventing  us  from  delivering  water  or  wastewater  services  to  our  customers,  or
requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses
may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.

Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers,
which  may  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Seasonal  drought  conditions  that  may  impact  our  water  services  are
possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the
supply adequacy  of any individual  system. As examples,  drought conditions had persisted  in California  over a five-year  period, and had been declared  in New
Jersey in 2016. In 2017, these droughts were declared concluded, but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary or
mandatory water use targets, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in
implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, we
cannot  assure  that  any  such  expenses  incurred  will,  in  fact,  be  fully  recovered.  Moreover,  reductions  in  water  consumption,  including  those  resulting  from
installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which
may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.

The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather
volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater
utilities, such as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

increased frequency and duration of droughts;

increased precipitation and flooding;

increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;

challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;

potential degradation of water quality;

decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;

increases in disruptions in service;

22

Table of Contents

•

•

increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or

increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our
water production and delivery facilities and systems.

Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recovered
through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to
enable us to recover such expenditures and costs, in whole or in part.

A  loss  of  one  or  more  large  industrial  customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  the  results  of  operations  of  one  or  more  of  our  Regulated
Businesses.

Adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers, particularly industrial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operations
by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent.
Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.

Our Regulated  Businesses  require  significant  capital  expenditures  and  may  suffer  if  we  fail  to  secure  appropriate  funding  to  make  investments,  or  if  we
experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.

The  water  and  wastewater  utility  business  is  capital  intensive.  We  invest  significant  amounts  of  capital  to  add,  replace  and  maintain  property,  plant  and
equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2018 , we invested $1.5 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expenditures
necessary  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  our  systems  will  continue  into  the  future  and  may  increase.  We  expect  to  fund  capital  improvement  projects  using  cash
generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt. We may not be able to
access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements
on favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we could be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our
capital  investment  strategies,  meet  our  growth  targets  and  expand  our  rate  base  to  enable  us  to  earn  satisfactory  future  returns  on  our  investments.  Even  with
adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as a
result of construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues.

The volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased
water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,
the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months
are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.

Three of our jurisdictions, California, Illinois, and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUC-authorized
revenue for a given period, which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover
the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, operating results
could continue to be affected by seasonality.

Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.

The  wastewater  collection,  treatment  and  disposal  operations  of  our  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  substantial  regulation  and  involve  environmental  risks.  If
collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties
or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods of
substantial  rainfall  or  flooding,  which  are  the  main  causes  of  sewer  overflow  and  system  failure.  Liabilities  resulting  from  such  damage  could  adversely  and
materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

23

Table of Contents

Contamination  of  water  supplies  or  our  water  service  provided  to  our  customers  could  result  in  service  limitations  and  interruptions  and  exposure  to
substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations,
government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.

The  water  supplies  that  flow  into  our  treatment  plants  or  are  delivered  through  our  distribution  system,  or  the  water  service  that  is  provided  to  our
customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems,
pollution resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, lead and other materials, chemical spills or other accidents that result
in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks. In addition, new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry.
If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take
responsive  actions  that  could  include,  among  other  things  (1)  continuing  limited  use  of  the  water  supply  under  a  “Do  Not  Use”  protective  order  that  enables
continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source
through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recover
costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms. Any recovery of these costs that we
are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising
from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our
drinking water and water supplies.

Since  we  engage  in  the  business  of  providing  water  service  to  our  customers,  contamination  of  the  water  supply,  or  the  water  service  provided  to  our
customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Such
claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may be
brought by our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur, and
we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputation
may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or
hazardous substances in the water or water supplies. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles
and other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.

We  maintain  insurance  coverage  as  part  of  our  overall  legal  and  risk  management  strategy  to  minimize  potential  liabilities  arising  from  our  utility
operations,  as  well  as  the  operations  of  our  Market-Based  Businesses  .  Our  insurance  programs  have  varying  coverage  limits,  exclusions  and  maximums,  and
insurance  companies  may  seek  to  deny  claims  we  might  make.  Generally,  our  insurance  policies  cover  property  damage,  worker’s  compensation,  employer’s
liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for
covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.

Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance  coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all
necessary  or  appropriate  insurance  in  the  future,  or  that  such  insurance  can  be  economically  secured.  For  example,  catastrophic  events  can  result  in  decreased
coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.

We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory
oversight or sanctions.

Water and wastewater utilities, including our regulated subsidiaries and our Market-Based Businesses , have a large direct and indirect customer base and,
as a result, are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of
water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment
may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light,
and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more
stringent regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations
governing  our  operations  and  less  favorable  economic  terms  in  our  agreements  related  to  our  Market-Based  Businesses  ,  as  well  as  fines,  penalties  or  other
sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

New York American Water Company, Inc. (“NYAW”) has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission (“NYSPSC”) investigation
related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an over-assessment of real property taxes. NYAW self-reported this
issue to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAW’s senior leadership became aware of it. Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as a
result of this matter, as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities. The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failure of a few
employees working on NYAW’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case. On September 11, 2018, the Supreme Court of the State
of  New  York,  Albany  County,  approved  a  settlement  of  these  matters,  and  NYAW  is  cooperating  with  the  NYSDPS  to  implement  its  terms.  As  part  of  the
settlement, NYAW agreed that it would provide up to $4.5 million to benefit NYAW customers through several different mechanisms, which amounts would not
be recoverable in rates. NYAW also agreed to accelerate the timing of the payment of approximately $6.4 million in aggregate customer credits. Finally, NYAW
agreed to engage and cooperate with an independent monitor through September 30, 2021. While the settlement resolves the NYSPSC’s investigation involving
NYAW and those matters set forth above, there can be no assurance that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal, state or local proceedings regarding these
and other related matters, and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil, administrative and/or criminal sanctions, which may have a material
adverse effect upon our reputation and perception.

Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes also may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less
favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our Market-Based Businesses, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition
of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows and liquidity.

The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 80 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams, and the failure of any of which could result
in personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also
adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may
make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.

We also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been
material. The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail
material costs. Although in most cases, the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to
recover  costs of repairs,  upgrades or dismantling  through rates  in the future.  The inability  to recover  these costs or delayed recovery  of the costs as a result of
regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and
reputation.

Our  operating  subsidiaries  distribute  water  and  collect  wastewater  through  an  extensive  network  of  pipes  and  storage  systems  located  across  the  United
States.  A  failure  of  major  pipes  or  reservoirs  could  result  in  injuries,  property  and  other  damage  for  which  we  may  be  liable.  The  failure  of  major  pipes  and
reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our
ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators,
including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation.
Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to
secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be
recovered through rate adjustments.

An  important  part  of  our  growth  strategy  is  the  acquisition  of  water  and  wastewater  systems,  which  involves  risks,  including  competition  for  acquisition
opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.

An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, service
areas. We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with
acquisition  candidates.  Further,  competition  for  acquisition  opportunities  from  other  regulated  utilities,  governmental  entities,  and  other  buyers  may  hinder  our
ability to expand our business.

Table of Contents

The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur

significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

incurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business, including liabilities
that were unknown at the time of acquisition;

failure to recover acquisition premiums;

unanticipated capital expenditures;

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;

recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;

fluctuations in quarterly results;

unanticipated acquisition-related expenses;

failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and

difficulties in assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.

Some  or  all  of  these  items  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business.  The  systems  and  businesses  we  acquire  in  the  future  may  not  achieve
anticipated  sales  and profitability  or other  perceived  synergies,  and any difficulties  we encounter  in the integration  process  could  interfere  with our operations,
reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.

We compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. If consolidation becomes
more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and
limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.

Our Regulated  Businesses  are  subject  to  condemnation  and  other  proceedings  through  eminent  domain  or  other  similar  authorized  process,  which  could
materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.

Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States,
and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public
ownership  and  operation  through  exercise  of  the  governmental  power  of  eminent  domain,  or  another  similar  authorized  process.  If  a  municipality  or  other
government subdivision or a citizen group seeks to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a
citizen petition, we may resist the acquisition.

For example, on November 27, 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMD
to conduct a feasibility study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of our California subsidiary’s Monterey water service
assets without an additional public vote. Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against
our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—
Condemnation and Eminent Domain , which includes additional information regarding these matters.

Furthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  our  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property
owners  to  file  a lawsuit  to  seek  just  compensation  against  a  public  utility,  if  the  public  utility’s  infrastructure  has  been  determined  to  be a  substantial  cause  of
damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, most recently, lawsuits have
been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural
event  that  resulted  in  damage  to  the  property.  In  some  cases,  the  PUC  has  disallowed  recovery  in  rates  of  losses  incurred  by  these  utilities  as  a  result  of  such
lawsuits.

Contesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedings
and may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may
require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding  or to pay a private  property owner compensation  for the property damage suffered.  If a
municipality  or  other  government  subdivision  succeeds  in  acquiring  the  assets  of  one  or  more  of  our  Regulated  Businesses  through  eminent  domain  or  other
process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be
able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.

We rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could
adversely affect our business.

Our technology systems are an integral part of our business, and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate
our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we
depend  on  these  systems  to  bill  customers,  process  orders,  provide  customer  service,  manage  certain  plant  operations  and  construction  projects,  manage  our
financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory and accounts receivable
collections.

Although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations, our technology systems remain

vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

•

•

•

•

•

power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;

operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees and contractors;

physical and electronic loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, hacking, denial of services action, misappropriation
of data or other property and similar events;

computer viruses; and

severe weather and other events, including without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters.

These events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property and other
adverse consequences. In addition, a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact
of any of these events on us. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and
we  might  lack  sufficient  resources  to  make  the  necessary  upgrades  or  replacements  of  outdated  existing  technology  to  enable  us  to  continue  to  operate  at  our
current  level  of efficiency.  Any or all  of these  events  could  have a material  adverse  impact  on our business, results  of operations,  financial  condition  and cash
flows.

We may be subject to physical and/or cyber attacks.

As  operators  of  critical  infrastructure,  we  may  face  a  heightened  risk  of  physical  and/or  cyber  attacks  from  internal  or  external  sources.  Our  water  and
wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our
operational technology and IT systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of
war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our
customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or
administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect
our operational technology and IT systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We
cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.

If, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer
and other confidential information lost or stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; suffer a loss of management time,
attention and resources from our regular business operations; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, and damage to our reputation, any of which could
have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with
applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings
and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and
insurance related costs.

In  addition,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  collect  and  retain  sensitive  information,  including  personally  identifiable  information,  about  our
customers and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/or
fraudulent  use  of  customer,  employee  or  proprietary  data  as  a  result  of  a  cyber  attack  could  subject  us  to  significant  litigation,  liability  and  costs,  as  well  as
adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.

We have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our IT systems, but
such insurance  is subject  to a number of exclusions  and may not cover the total loss or damage caused  by a breach.  The market  for cybersecurity  insurance  is
relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates
that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.

Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and IT systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected
costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.

Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management’s
time  and  financial  resources  to  complete,  and  may  also  result  in  system  or  network  defects  or  operational  errors  due  to  multiple  factors,  including  employees’
ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and have
installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and
enhance our customer service capabilities. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may
increase  costs  beyond  those  anticipated  and  have  an  adverse  or  disruptive  effect  on  our  operations  and  reporting  processes,  including  our  internal  control  over
financial  reporting.  We  may  also  experience  difficulties  integrating  current  systems  with  new  or  upgraded  systems,  which  may  impact  our  ability  to  serve  our
customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all
such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life, and be exposed
to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities.

Our safety record is critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the
public. Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid all accidents or other safety
incidents at all times.

Our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees, contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces of
equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites we are responsible for
safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not
followed by our employees or others, our employees, contractors and others may be injured or die. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee
turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In  addition,  our  operations  can  involve  the  delivery,  handling  and  storage  of  hazardous  chemicals,  which,  if  improperly  delivered,  handled,  stored  or
disposed of, could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealing
with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety,
and environmental work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations or
procedures could subject us to liability.

Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations.

As of December 31, 2018 , approximately 49% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 70 collective bargaining agreements in place with
15 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, including 20 which expired in 2018 , and 18 which will expire
during 2019 , are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair
to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work
stoppages.  Labor  actions,  work  stoppages  or  the  threat  of  work  stoppages,  and  our  failure  to  obtain  favorable  labor  contract  terms  during  renegotiations,  may
disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. While
we  have  developed  contingency  plans  to  be  implemented  as  necessary  if  a  work  stoppage  or  strike  does  occur,  a  strike  or  work  stoppage  may  have  a  material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.

The  success  of  our  business  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  hire,  retain,  and  utilize  qualified  personnel,  including  engineers,  licensed  operators,  water
quality  and  other  operating  and  craft  personnel,  and  management  professionals  who  have  the  required  experience  and  expertise.  From  time  to  time,  it  may  be
difficult  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  individuals  with  the  expertise  and  in  the  timeframe  demanded  for  our  business  needs.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  for
example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.

In addition, as some of our key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement
such plans. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Financial and Market-Related Risks

Our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate
sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.

As of December 31, 2018 , our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was
$8.6  billion  ,  and  our  working  capital  (defined  as  current  assets  less  current  liabilities)  was  in  a  deficit  position.  Our  indebtedness  could  have  important
consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;

exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;

limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;

impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;

requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby
reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;

limiting  our ability  to  take  advantage  of significant  business opportunities,  such  as acquisition  opportunities,  and to react  to  changes  in market  or
industry conditions; and

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.

In order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new short-
term  and  long-term  debt  securities.  Moreover,  additional  borrowings  may  be  required  to  refinance  outstanding  indebtedness.  Debt  maturities  and  sinking  fund
payments in 2019 , 2020 and 2021 will be $72 million , $32 million and $303 million , respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the
debt capital markets on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting
our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.

In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt, we have entered into, and in the future
may  enter  into,  financial  derivative  instruments,  including  without  limitation,  interest  rate  swaps,  forward  starting  swaps,  swaptions  and  U.S.  Treasury  lock
agreements. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate
risk,  and  may  expose  us  to  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  including  quarterly  “mark  to  market”  valuation  risk  associated  with  these  instruments,  that  could
negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Therefore, our
ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic,
competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control. If
we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt,
reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from
operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our
business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected adversely.

Our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to
meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to cash from operations, we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, and the capital markets to satisfy our
liquidity needs. In this regard, our principal external sources of short-term liquidity are our $2.10 billion commercial paper program and our $2.25 billion revolving
credit  facility.  Our  revolving  credit  facility  expires  in  accordance  with  its  terms  in  March  2023.  We  regularly  use  our  commercial  paper  program  under  this
revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper
market. As of December 31, 2018 , American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), our wholly owned financing subsidiary, had no outstanding borrowings under the
revolving credit facility, and had $954 million of commercial paper outstanding and $81 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that
AWCC  will  be  able  to  continue  to  access  its  commercial  paper  program  or  its  revolving  credit  facility,  when,  as  and  if  desired,  or  that  the  amount  of  capital
available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.

Under the terms of our revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms
of the credit facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit, lenders under the credit facility would
be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable. To avoid such a
default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would
restrict our operational and financing flexibility.

Our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various
risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant
write-down of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our
business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we
may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.

Disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. On January
2018, Moody’s Investors Service changed its rating outlook from stable to negative for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies, including us. While the
lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or
deterioration  of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the
terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments, and we
may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain,
renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, including as a result of changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced
financing  alternatives,  or  failures  of  significant  financial  institutions  could  adversely  affect  our  access  to  the  liquidity  needed  for  our  business.  Any  significant
disruption in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or
until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing
other discretionary expenditures.

Any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from
financial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

American Water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to
pay upstream dividends or repay funds to American Water.

American Water is a holding company and, as such, American Water has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets
are held by subsidiaries. American Water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net
income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to American Water or repay indebtedness to American Water. Prior to paying
dividends to American Water, American Water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including,
for example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and
covenants and other agreements made or entered into by American Water and its subsidiaries. American Water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no
obligation to pay dividends to American Water. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could
have a material adverse impact on American Water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.

We may not be able to fully utilize our U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards.

As  of  December  31,  2018  ,  we  had  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  approximately  $707  million  and  $547  million  ,  respectively,  and
management  believes  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  these  NOL  carryforwards  will  be  recovered  in  the  future.  With  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA,  the  Company
analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, including
its NOL carryforwards, and as a result, remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change.

Our federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 , and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through
2037. We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires, and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient
taxable income. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in
the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income.

Our  actual  results  may  differ  from  those  estimated  by  management  in  making  its  assessment  as  to  our  ability  to  use  the  NOL carryforwards.  Moreover,
adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJA and other changes in income tax laws, the economy and the general business environment could affect
the  future  utilization  of  our  NOL  carryforwards.  If  we  are  unable  to  fully  utilize  our  NOL  carryforwards  to  offset  taxable  income  generated  in  the  future,  our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may
negatively affect our results of operations.

Our total assets include $1.6 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2018 . The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an
affiliate of our previous owner in 2003, the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001, the acquisition of Pivotal in 2018
and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Keystone in 2015. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net
tangible  and  other  intangible  assets  acquired.  Goodwill  is  recorded  at  fair  value  on  the  date  of  an  acquisition  and  is  reviewed  annually  or  more  frequently  if
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash
charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past.

We  may  be  required  to  recognize  an  impairment  of  goodwill  in  the  future  due  to  market  conditions  or  other  factors  related  to  our  performance  or  the
performance of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in
valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in
control premiums, or, with respect to Keystone, fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions served by
Keystone, a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results, cash flows or key
assumptions.  In  this  regard,  in  the  third  quarter  of  2018,  we  strategically  narrowed  the  scope  of  the  Keystone  business  solely  to  water  transfer  services  due  to
operational and financial challenges in the other businesses of Keystone. As a result of this strategic change, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of
$57 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to Keystone. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information.

A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could
also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred,
which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and could
make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of
our regulators.

Market  conditions  may  impact  the  value  of  benefit  plan  assets  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  assumptions  related  to  the  benefit  plans,  which  may  require  us  to
provide significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and
postretirement  benefit  plans.  The  value  of these  assets  is  subject  to  market  fluctuations,  which may  cause  investment  returns  to  fall  below  our projected  return
rates.  A  decline  in  the  market  value  of  the  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plan  assets  can  increase  the  funding  requirements  under  our  pension  and
postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates decrease,
our  liabilities  would  increase,  potentially  increasing  benefit  expense  and  funding  requirements.  Further,  changes  in  demographics,  such  as  increases  in  life
expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirement
costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively
affected.

In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. For
example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that
market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

New  accounting  standards  or  changes  to  existing  accounting  standards  could  materially  impact  how  we  report  our  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  and
financial condition.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative
bodies  or  governmental  entities  may  issue  new  pronouncements  or  new  interpretations  of  existing  accounting  standards  that  may  require  us  to  change  our
accounting policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash
flow and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash
flow and financial condition.

Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.

Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and
information  in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner  in  compliance  with  GAAP,  taxation  requirements,  federal  securities  laws  and  regulations  and  other  laws  and
regulations  applicable  to  us.  Such  compliance  permits  us  to,  among  other  things,  disclose  and  report  financial  and  other  information  in  connection  with  the
recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations.

We have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the  “Sarbanes-Oxley  Act”)  and  relevant  SEC  rules,  as  well  as  other  applicable  regulations.  Such  internal  controls  and  policies  have  been  and  continue  to  be
closely  monitored  by  our  management  and  Board  of  Directors  to  ensure  continued  compliance  with  these  laws,  rules  and  regulations.  Management  is  also
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While
we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary
lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery
and noncompliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could
also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or AWCC’s ability to access the capital markets.

Additional Risks Related to Our Market-Based Businesses

We  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provide  performance  guarantees  with  respect  to  certain  obligations  of  our  Market-Based  Businesses  , including
financial guarantees or deposits, to our public-sector and public clients, and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our Market-Based Businesses
do not satisfy these obligations.

Under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entities
and  other  customers,  American  Water  (excluding  our  regulated  subsidiaries)  provides  guarantees  of  specified  performance  obligations  of  our  Market-Based
Businesses , including financial guarantees or deposits, primarily related to Military Service Group. In the event our Market-Based Businesses fail to perform these
obligations,  the  entity  holding  the  guarantees  may  seek  to  enforce  the  performance  commitments  against  us  or  proceed  against  the  deposit.  In  that  event,  our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely affected.

At December  31,  2018  ,  we  had  remaining  performance  commitments  as  measured  by  remaining  contract  revenue  totaling  approximately  $4.3 billion
related to our Military Services Group contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if our Market-Based Businesses expand. The presence of these commitments
may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.

32

Table of Contents

Our  Market-Based  Businesses’  operations  under  our  Military  Services  Group  are  subject  to  various  risks  associated  with  doing  business  with  the  U.S.
government.

We enter into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated,
in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary
performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of
operations and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes
in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Moreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level
of  government  spending  and  compliance  with  and  changes  in  governmental  procurement  and  security  regulations.  We  are  subject  to  potential  government
investigations  of  our  business  practices  and  compliance  with  government  procurement  and  security  regulations,  which  are  complex,  and  compliance  with  these
regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or barred from bidding
on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.

Our Market-Based Businesses under the Contract Services Group operate a limited number of water and wastewater systems under long-term O&M contracts
and face the risk that the owners of those systems  may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems, which may negatively  affect the Contract
Services Group as the operator of the systems, and we may incur costs in excess of payments received.

The Contract Services Group operates a limited number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, the Contract
Services Group operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system
to undertake capital improvements. In some cases, the Contract Services Group may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to
maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner
of the system under these contracts,  those non-compliance  events may reflect poorly on the Contract Services Group as the operator  of the system and us, and
damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner.

In  addition,  the  Contract  Services  Group  has  entered  into  long-term  contracts  under  which  they  agree  to  operate  and  maintain  a  municipality’s  or  other
party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities, which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual
fee. The Contract Services Group is generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities, including production costs such
as purchased water, electricity, fuel and chemicals used in water treatment, may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party. Losses
under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters.

Keystone’s  operations,  and  the  operation  generally  of  natural  gas  and  oil  exploration  and  production  facilities  by  Keystone’s  customers,  are  subject  to
stringent  federal,  state  and  local  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  ordinances  governing  the  release  of  materials  into  the  environment  or  otherwise  relating  to
environmental protection. These provisions may require the acquisition by Keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers, prohibit the
release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities, and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result
from these operations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to
Keystone, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities. Under existing
environmental  laws  and  regulations,  Keystone  could  be  held  strictly  liable  for  the  removal  or  remediation  of  previously  released  materials  or  property
contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations, or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they
were performed. While we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of Keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe should insulate the
Company,  its  regulated  subsidiaries  and  its  other  Market-Based  Businesses  from  any  liabilities  associated  with  Keystone’s  operations,  including  liabilities  for
environmental matters, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the Company from incurring liability for the operations of Keystone.

Changes  in  environmental  laws  and  regulations  occur  frequently,  and  any  changes  to  these  or  other  laws  governing  the  natural  gas  and  oil  exploration
industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require Keystone to make
significant  expenditures  to  maintain  compliance  with  such  requirements,  may  harm  Keystone’s  business  and  results  of  operations  by  reducing  the  demand  for
Keystone’s  water  and  related  services,  and  may  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Keystone’s  competitive  position,  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and cash flows.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions

Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions

Under the 2009 Order, Cal Am is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a
set reduction schedule. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water
from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, the
SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving a five-year extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 Order, to December 31, 2021.

34

Table of Contents

The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use
of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decision
directing  modifications  in Cal Am’s tariffs  to recognize  the moratorium  mandated  by the 2009 Order, and directing  Cal Am to seek written guidance from the
SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to
Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. On March 19, 2018, the
MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. On May 4, 2018, Cal
Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In
an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The
SWRCB  has  circulated  revisions  to  its  2012  interpretive  letter,  which  are  being  reviewed  and  discussed  by  the  parties.  Any  failure  to  follow  the  MPWMD’s
resolution or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against Cal
Am.

The 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the Water
Supply Project, proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration. On May 8, 2018, certain parties to the
Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposed
expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim that
compliance with the alternate  milestones would still provide for cessation  of Cal Am’s unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021. A preliminary
report on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2,250 acre-feet of water per year. Cal Am believes that
(i) the petition is premature, (ii) the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and, even if construction is
successfully  completed,  would  provide  an  insufficient  quantity  of  water  to  allow  full  compliance  with  the  2009  Order,  and  (iii)  the  imposition  of  parallel
milestones would distract from completion of the Water Supply Project. This petition remains pending.

Regional Desalination Project Litigation

Review
of
CPUC-Approved
Settlement
Agreement

The Regional Desalination Project (the “RDP”) involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina, north of Monterey. The RDP was
intended  to,  among  other  things,  eliminate  unauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  the  2009  Order.  In  December  2010,  the  CPUC
approved  the  RDP,  which  was  to  be  implemented  through  a  Water  Purchase  Agreement  and  ancillary  agreements  (collectively,  the  “Agreements”)  among  the
Marina  Coast  Water  District  (“MCWD”),  the  Monterey  County  Water  Resources  Agency  (“MCWRA”)  and  Cal  Am.  In  2011,  due  to  a  conflict  of  interest
concerning  a  former  member  of  MCWRA’s  Board  of  Directors,  MCWRA  stated  that  the  Agreements  were  void,  and,  as  a  result,  Cal  Am  terminated  the
Agreements. In April 2015, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am, MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among the
parties signing the agreement. In March 2016, the Supreme Court of California granted MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC approval, and following the
court’s disposition of a related issue in another case, MCWD’s petition for review of the CPUC-approved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC, and
remains pending.

Cal
Am’s
Action
for
Damages
Following
RDP
Termination

In October 2012, Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD, which was ultimately transferred to the San Francisco
County Superior Court, seeking a determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest. In June 2015, the court entered
a final judgment agreeing with Cal Am’s position that four of the five Agreements are void, and one, the credit line agreement, is not void. In November 2016, the
Supreme  Court  of  California  denied  MCWD’s  final  appeal  of  this  judgment,  which  allows  further  proceedings,  discussed  below,  to  determine  the  amount  of
damages that may be awarded in the proceeding.

In  July  2015,  Cal  Am  and  MCWRA  filed  a  Complaint  in  San  Francisco  County  Superior  Court  against  MCWD  and  RMC  Water  and  Environment
(“RMC”), a private engineering consulting firm, seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of $10 million associated with the failure of the RDP, as well
as  punitive  and  treble  damages,  statutory  penalties  and  attorneys’  fees.  Shortly  thereafter,  complaints  seeking  similar  damages  were  filed  in  the  same  court  by
MCWD and RMC against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of $19 million in the aggregate. In December 2015, the court consolidated all of these complaints into a
single action. Trial in the consolidated action currently remains set for March 25, 2019 in San Francisco County Superior Court.

Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project

CPUC
Final
Approval
of
Water
Supply
Project

The Water Supply Project is intended to reduce water diversions from the Carmel River and involves construction of a desalination plant, owned by Cal
Am, and purchase of water by Cal Am from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control
Agency and the MPWMD. Cal Am’s ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC
and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a decision
to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50
million in associated costs, subject to meeting certain criteria. If construction costs exceed $50 million, Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery.

On August 13, 2018, the CPUC issued its proposed decision granting Cal Am’s request for a CPCN for a 6.4 million gallons per day desalination plant,
certifying  the  final  Environmental  Impact  Report/Environmental  Impact  Statement  (“EIR/EIS”)  and  denying  all  other  outstanding  motions.  On  September  13,
2018, the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision (i) finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUC’s requirements for a CPCN, and (ii) finding that
(a) the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed, and (b) an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUC’s
decision directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the GWR Project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency and
the MPWMD and to indicate whether Cal Am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the GWR Project. The
decision notes, however, that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project is delayed such that Cal Am would not be able to meet
the December 31, 2021 deadline to comply with the 2009 Order. The decision accepts Cal Am’s estimates of future water demand in Monterey and concludes that
the Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs, and adopts Cal Am’s most recent cost estimates. The decision also allows Cal Am to earn an
allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, at a rate representative of its actual financing costs. The final decision adopted frameworks as to cost
caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters.

In  addition,  the  CPUC  final  decision  imposes  numerous  reporting  and  filing  requirements  to  ensure  the  expenditures  for  the  Water  Supply  Project  are
reasonable, including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers, and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the
authorized  cost  caps.  The  reasonableness  of  Water  Supply  Project  costs  will  be  reviewed  in  the  first  general  rate  case  filed  by  Cal  Am  after  the  Water  Supply
Project becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the
construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC
costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Consistent with that
decision,  on  December  31,  2018,  Cal  Am  sought  adjustments  to  certain  financing  and  ratemaking  provisions,  including  the  timing  and  amount  of  surcharge
recovery, and addressed related implementation issues.

On October 19, 2018, MCWD and the City of Marina filed applications for rehearing before the CPUC. Cal Am filed its response to the applications for

rehearing on November 5, 2018. On January 31, 2019, the CPUC denied these applications for rehearing.

On October 12, 2018, MCWD and the City of Marina filed petitions for writ of review in the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency of the
final  EIR/EIS.  On  December  12,  2018,  the  Supreme  Court  of  California  denied  the  petitions  for  writ  of  review  without  prejudice  to  the  filing  of  renewed
submissions upon completion of the rehearing proceedings pending before the CPUC. The City of Marina and MCWD filed their renewed petitions for writ of
review on January 16, 2019 and January 17, 2019, respectively.

Coastal
Development
Permit
Application

On June 22, 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water Supply
Project located within the City of Marina’s coastal zone. Members of the City’s Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed
opposition to the Water Supply Project. On August 9, 2018, the City deemed Cal Am’s application incomplete pending certification and submission of the final
environmental impact report, and stated that the City could not rule on the permit until certification. As noted above, the CPUC certified the final EIR/EIS for the
Water Supply Project on September 13, 2018. A public hearing before the Planning Commission on Cal Am’s application was held on February 14, 2019, and the
Planning Commission voted to direct staff to prepare findings supporting a denial of the application. The Planning Commission continued the hearing until March
7, 2019, at which time it is expected to take formal action on the application.

Proposed
Zoning
Changes
at
Cemex
Site
for
Slant
Wells

On August 30, 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the
matter for consideration on the Planning Commission’s agenda for its September 13, 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the Cemex
site to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change
to  the  City's  local  coastal  program  must  ultimately  be  approved  by  the  California  Coastal  Commission  (the  “Coastal  Commission”).  Cal  Am,  Cemex  and  the
Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 8, 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution
recommending that the Marina City Council consider approving the amendments.

On December 4, 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, Cemex and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters
opposing  the  proposed  changes,  but  the  City  Council  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution  amending  its  local  coastal  plan  and  a  draft  amendment  to  its  zoning
ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the City’s December 18, 2018 meeting. The changes to the
local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.

Test
Slant
Well
Permitting

A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of
the  property  on  which  intake  wells  will  be  located  to  draw  water  from  under  Monterey  Bay.  In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastal
development  permits  for  the  test  slant  well,  enabling  Cal  Am  to  construct  and  operate  the  test  slant  well.  The  Coastal  Commission  has  approved  permit
amendments to allow the test slant well to remain and place and be maintained until February 28, 2020. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands
Commission,  as  amended,  will  expire  on  December  16,  2019.  Effective  February  28,  2018,  test  slant  well  pumping  ceased,  except  for  minimal  maintenance
pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Am’s coastal development permits.

In November 2015, MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Court
against the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well
pumping. In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017, the court denied MCWD’s challenges. On January 12, 2018, MCWD filed a notice of appeal of
the court’s judgment. On March 13, 2018, Cal Am filed a motion to dismiss MCWD’s appeal, which was denied on June 25, 2018. The appeal remains pending.

In July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property on which
intake wells will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly
limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record.

Based on all of the foregoing, Cal Am estimates that the earliest date by which the Water Supply Project desalination plant could be completed is sometime
in 2021. There can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that Cal Am
will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, or that any such
compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am or the Company.

West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill

See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding the final court approval of the global settlement with respect to the January 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical
spill, which is incorporated herein by reference.

In  April  2017,  the  Lincoln  County  (West  Virginia)  Commission  (the  “LCC”)  filed  a  complaint  in  Lincoln  County  state  court  against  West  Virginia-
American Water Company (“WVAWC”) and certain other defendants not affiliated with the Company, which in June 2017 was transferred to the West Virginia
Mass Litigation Panel, alleging that the Freedom Industries chemical spill caused a public nuisance in Lincoln County under an ordinance enacted by the LCC in
March 2017, more than three years after the Freedom Industries chemical spill occurred. The complaint sought an injunction against WVAWC that would have
required the creation of various databases and public repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and risk
assessments regarding the alleged exposure of Lincoln County residents to the released chemicals. On July 31, 2018, WVAWC filed a motion to dismiss the LCC’s
complaint. On December 12, 2018, the Mass Litigation Panel granted WVAWC’s motion to dismiss on several grounds, including being barred by the applicable
statute of limitations, failure to allege a nuisance under applicable law, lack of standing, improper retroactive application of the nuisance ordinance and violation of
WVAWC’s due process. The LCC declined to appeal this ruling.

On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
WVAWC’s West  Relay pumping  station  located  in the  City of Dunbar. The failure  of the main  caused  water  outages  and low pressure  to up to approximately
25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,
2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%
by  the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  was
reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully
restored on July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.

On June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class of
residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for
failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance
and operation of the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of
use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.

In October  2017, WVAWC filed  with the  court  a motion  seeking  to dismiss  all  of the plaintiffs’  counts alleging  statutory  and common  law  tort  claims.
Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations  involving
violations  of  the  applicable  tariff,  the  public  utility  code  and  related  rules.  On  May  30,  2018,  the  court,  at  a  hearing,  denied  WVAWC’s  motion  to  apply  the
primary jurisdiction doctrine, and on October 11, 2018, the court issued a written order to that effect. The court has not yet issued a written order on WVAWC’s
motion to dismiss plaintiffs’  tort claims. The court has requested  the parties  submit a scheduling order with a trial date of August 26, 2019, and WVAWC has
sought to prevent further discovery while its motion to dismiss is pending.

The Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will

continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.

Contract Services Group -- East Palo Alto Water System Voluntary Report

In April 2017, AWE, the parent entity of the Company’s Contract Services Group , voluntarily reported to the Division of Drinking Water of the SWRCB
potential  violations  of  the  California  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  (the  “CSDWA”)  in  connection  with  AWE’s  operation  of  the  City  of  East  Palo  Alto’s  water
distribution  system.  Upon  the  resignation  of  the  system’s  general  manager  in  March  2017,  AWE  discovered  that  it  may  have  operated  the  system  without  a
properly certified operator for two years, the triennial LCR sampling was not completed, and the 2015 Consumer Confidence Report improperly reported data for
lead and copper samples from the system’s upstream water provider. Promptly after discovering these issues, AWE engaged an outside law firm to conduct an
internal investigation and reported the results of that investigation to the SWRCB.

On  June  15,  2017,  the  SWRCB  issued  to  AWE  a  citation  that  required  AWE  to,  among  other  things:  comply  with  regulations  related  to  water  operator
certifications, lead and copper tap sampling requirements and the publishing of a Consumer Confidence Report; provide public notification of the LCR violation;
and  prepare  a  corrective  action  plan  to  evaluate  the  causes  leading  to  these  incidents  and  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  recurrence  of  future  incidents.  The
citation did not impose on AWE any monetary penalties, but the SWRCB reserved the right to take additional enforcement action.

In October 2017, the SWRCB advised AWE that it is in compliance with all of the directives and relevant statutory and administrative provisions specified
in the SWRCB’s June 2017 citation. While AWE has completed all required compliance activities with respect to the citation, the SWRCB has previously reserved
the right to take additional enforcement action. In February 2018, the SWRCB referred this matter to the San Mateo County, California District Attorney’s office
for further investigation. AWE continues to cooperate with the SWRCB, the City of East Palo Alto and the San Mateo County District Attorney regarding this
matter. Proven violations of the CSDWA may result in civil and criminal penalties.

General

Periodically, the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings described
in this Item 3—Legal Proceedings , the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial position or results
of operations. However, litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance.
It  is  possible  that  some  litigation  and  other  proceedings  could  be  decided  unfavorably  to  the  Company,  and  that  any  such  unfavorable  decisions  could  have  a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 5.

MARKET  FOR  REGISTRANT’S  COMMON  EQUITY,  RELATED  STOCKHOLDER  MATTERS  AND  ISSUER  PURCHASES  OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

Since April 23, 2008, our common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AWK.” As of February 14, 2019 , there
were 180,751,697 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 2,619 record holders. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends
when they are declared by our Board of Directors. See Note 9—Shareholders' Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding our dividends.

In February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through our
dividend  reinvestment,  employee  stock  purchase  and  executive  compensation  activities.  The  program  allows  us  to  purchase  up  to  10  million  shares  of  our
outstanding  common  stock  over  an  unrestricted  period  of  time  in  the  open  market  or  through  privately  negotiated  transactions.  The  program  is  conducted  in
accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and, to facilitate these repurchases, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plans with a third-party broker,
which allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock at times when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of
self-imposed  trading  blackout  periods.  Subject  to  applicable  regulations,  we  may  elect  to  amend  or  cancel  the  program  or  stock  repurchase  parameters  at  our
discretion to manage dilution.

From April 1, 2015, the date repurchases under the anti-dilutive stock repurchase program commenced, through December 31, 2018 , we repurchased an
aggregate of 4,510,000 shares of our common stock under the program, including  560,000 shares  repurchased  during the  first  quarter  of  2018 . There were no
repurchases of common stock in the last three quarters of 2018 .

Overview

American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by
both operating revenues and population served. We employ approximately 7,100 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services
to  more  than  14  million  people  in  46 states  and  Ontario,  Canada.  Our  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  utilities  that  provide  water  and  wastewater
services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as our “ Regulated Businesses .”
Our  utilities  operate  in  approximately  1,600 communities  in  16 states  in  the  United  States,  with  approximately  3.4  million  active  customers  to  our  water  and
wastewater networks. Services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged
in utility regulation. We also operate market-based businesses which provide a broad range of related and complementary water, wastewater and other services to
residential and smaller commercial customers, the U.S. government on military installations and shale natural gas exploration and production companies, as well as
municipalities, utilities and industrial customers, collectively presented as our Market-Based Businesses . See Item 1—Business for additional information.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 , diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $3.15 , an increase of $0.77 per diluted share, or 32.4% compared to the

prior year, which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ Adjustments to GAAP ” section below.

Excluding the net adjustments presented in the table above, adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $3.30 for the year ended December 31,

2018 , an increase of $0.27 per diluted share, or 8.9% compared to the prior year.

These results were driven by continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with
strong  results  in  our  Market-Based  Businesses  ,  primarily  in  our Homeowner  Services  Group  with the  mid-year  acquisition  of  Pivotal  .  These  increases  were
partially  offset  by  higher  O&M  and  depreciation  expenses  from  the  growth  of  the  business  and  a  lower  tax  shield  on  interest  expense  at  the  parent  company
resulting from the TCJA.

For the year ended December 31, 2017 , diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $2.38 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.24 per diluted share, or 9.2%
compared to the prior year, which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ Adjustments to GAAP ” section
below.

Excluding the net adjustments presented in the table above, adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $3.03 for the year ended December 31,

2017 , an increase of $0.19 per diluted share, or 6.7% compared to the prior year.

These results were driven by continued growth in our Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with
growth in our Market-Based Businesses from our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone. These increases were partially offset by lower water services demand
in our Regulated Businesses and lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group.

Adjustments to GAAP

Adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact
of one or more of the following events: (i) a gain in the third quarter of 2018 on the sale of the majority of our Contract Services Group ’s O&M contracts; (ii) a
goodwill and intangible impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018 resulting from narrowing the scope of the Keystone business; (iii) insurance settlements
received  in  the  third  quarter  of  2017  and  the  second  quarter  of  2018  related  to  the  Freedom  Industries  chemical  spill  in  West  Virginia;  (iv)  non-cash  re-
measurement  charges recorded in the fourth quarters  of 2017 and 2018 resulting  from the impact  of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on the
Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA; (v) an early extinguishment of debt charge at the parent company in the third quarter of 2017;
and (vi) a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.

We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of our ongoing
operating  results,  and  that  providing  this  non-GAAP  measure  will  allow  investors  to  understand  better  our  businesses’  operating  performance  and  facilitate  a
meaningful year-to-year comparison of our results of operations. Although management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to evaluate our results of
operations, we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider them as indicators of
performance. This non-GAAP financial measure is derived from our consolidated financial information and it should be considered in addition to, and not as a
substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure as defined and used above
may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, it may have significant limitations on its use.

Achievements and Strategic Focus

We believe our success has, and will continue to be, guided by the following strategic philosophies:

•

•

•

•

Purpose Driven—“We keep life flowing” is our trademark purpose, for our customers and our communities, because we provide the most precious of
life’s critical needs.

People Powered—A company is its people. People who have a safe place to work, both physically and emotionally.

Customer Obsessed—Without customers, we don’t exist. They are why we are here.

Trusted Source of Everything Water— Best in class, ensuring we have safe, reliable and affordable water.

43

Table of Contents

Our strategy, which is driven by our vision and values, will continue to be anchored on our five central themes:

•

Safety—Safety is both a strategy and a value at American Water. We put safety first in everything that we do.

•

In 2018 , we:

•

•

•

•

finished the year with fewer employee injuries than the prior year, improving both our Occupational Safety and Health Administration
Recordable Incident Rate (“ORIR”) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) injury severity rate;

continued  to  strengthen  our  safety  culture  as  measured  by  employee  responses  to  safety-related  questions  in  the  Company’s  culture
survey, and feedback from our in-person, labor-management conferences;

initiated  a  frontline  safety  leadership  strategic  action  group,  developed  to  provide  recommendations  to  improve  safety  leadership
training, tools, and engagement; and

championed, through our safety council which consists of management and labor employees, our annual Safety Day, the CEO Safety
Award and other recognition programs.

•

Looking forward, we will:

•

•

•

•

•

strive toward zero workplace incidents and eliminate hazards to reduce the potential for incidents;

continue our focus on “near miss reporting” and promoting continuous learning and corrective action regarding potential safety hazards
before incidents can occur;

improve toward the achievement of our ORIR and DART targets;

continue our focus on requiring contractors that perform work for the Company be held to the same safety standards as our employees;
and

continue to promote the Company’s employee Stop Work Authority, where every employee is empowered to stop any work he or she
perceives as unsafe, and to initiate a review to resolve concerns and to eliminate safety hazards.

•

Customer—Our customers are at the center of everything we plan and do. Customer input, their ideas and experiences will drive how we improve our
processes and systems. We want to be the best, and if our customers have a choice as to who serves them, we want it to be us.

•

In 2018 , we:

•

•

•

achieved a customer satisfaction rating in the top quartile among our industry peer group;

expanded our customer experience initiative, designed to make it easier for customers to do business with us, and enhanced our quality
of service through implementation and upgrades of technology tools; and

continued to make needed infrastructure investments while implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer bills
affordable.

•

Looking forward, we will:

•

•

aim  to  achieve  customer  satisfaction  and  service  quality  ratings  in  the  top  quartile  of  service  industries  beyond  the  water  and
wastewater industry. We are implementing a multi-year plan to enhance technology and innovation in our customer experience through
(i) leveraging secure artificial intelligence to better serve our customers, (ii) using online customer communities for immediate input
and  reactions  before  implementing  programs,  and  (iii)  mapping  our  most  frequent  customer  interactions  and  re-working  our  internal
processes to how customers want services; and

aim for top quartile ratings for drinking water quality and being an industry leader in system resiliency and environmental stewardship.

•

People—We are building an inclusive, diverse, fully-engaged, high performance workforce and culture, creating an environment where our people
feel valued, included and accountable.

•

In 2018 , we:

•

continued to demonstrate our commitment to employees by expanding training and development across the Company, with virtually all
employees completing at least 20 hours of formal training during 2018 ;

44

Table of Contents

•

•

•

expanded the executive leadership team to include key operational leaders across the Company to enable a broader operational focus
and stronger communication throughout the organization;

reached a new, five -year national benefits agreement with approximately 3,200 of our union-represented  employees, including their
participation in the Company’s annual performance plan, which will align Company goals across all employees, as well as providing
additional medical plan options for our employees and their families; and

simplified  our  performance  management  process  to  foster  meaningful  feedback  conversations  and  ensure  feedback  is  the  focus  of
performance management.

•

Looking forward, we will:

•

•

•

•

implement a strategic workforce plan which will address the changing requirements of our business and our jobs, largely driven by our
customer’s expectations and new technologies;

continue to improve inclusion and diversity of our overall employee population, ensuring our workforce is reflective of the customers
and communities we serve;

implement  a  new  and  more  frequent  culture  survey  focused  on  employee  insights  into  how  American  Water  can  become  a  better
company to work for, and to implement recommendations with the goal of increasing employees’ likelihood to recommend American
Water as a place to work; and

leverage technology to ensure our employees have the tools and resources they need to keep the customer at the center of everything
that we plan and do.

•

Growth—We  expect  to  continue  to  grow  our  businesses,  with  the  majority  of  our  growth  to  be  achieved  in  our  Regulated Businesses through (i)
continued capital investment in our infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers, and
(ii)  regulated  acquisitions  to  expand  our  services  to  new  customers.  We  also  expect  to  continue  to  grow  our  Market-Based  Businesses  ,  which
leverage our core water and wastewater competencies.

•

In 2018 , we invested $2.0 billion in our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses .

Regulated Businesses Growth

•

•

•

$1.5 billion capital investment in our Regulated Businesses , the majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements.

$33 million to fund acquisitions in our Regulated Businesses , which added approximately 14,000 water and wastewater customers.

Entered into agreements as of January 31, 2019 for pending acquisitions to add approximately 61,000 customers including:

•

•

On  May  30,  2018  ,  our  Pennsylvania  subsidiary  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  wastewater  assets  of  Exeter
Township, Pennsylvania, for approximately $96 million . This system currently serves approximately 9,000 customers. We are
expecting to close this acquisition during the third quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approval.

On April 13, 2018 , our Illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the City of Alton, Illinois’ regional wastewater
system  for  approximately  $54  million  .  This  system  currently  represents  approximately  23,000  customers,  comprised  of
approximately 11,000 customers in Alton and an additional 12,000 customers under bulk contracts in the nearby communities
of  Bethalto  and  Godfrey.  In  connection  with  the  execution  of  the  purchase  agreement,  our  Illinois  subsidiary  made  a  $5
million non-escrowed deposit to the seller during January 2019. We are expecting to close this acquisition during the second
quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approval.

Market-Based Businesses Growth and Optimization

•

We invested $365 million to acquire Pivotal, a leading provider of home warranty protection products and services for gas, electric and
other service lines inside and around a home, heating and cooling systems, and home appliances. Pivotal, which joins our Homeowner
Services Group , operates in 18 states with approximately 1.2 million customer contracts at the time of acquisition.

•

Our Military Services Group was awarded a contract for ownership, operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at
Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, effective  October 1, 2018 . Designated as the U.S. Army’s Maneuver Support Center of Excellence
and the home to three U.S. Army schools, Fort Leonard Wood directly and indirectly supports 36,400 jobs across the state of Missouri.
The contract award includes estimated revenues of approximately  $591 million  over a  50 -year period, subject to an annual economic
price adjustment.

On July 5, 2018 , we entered into an agreement for the sale of 22 of our Contract Services Group ’s 33 O&M contracts to subsidiaries
of Veolia Environnement S.A. for $27 million . We closed on the sale of 20 of the 22 contracts during the third quarter of 2018, and
expect to close on the sale of the remaining two contracts, subject to customer consents, in the first half of 2019. We will retain four of
our O&M contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas, and expect the majority of our remaining O&M contracts to be
sold to other parties, or expire within the next year.

As a result of operational and financial challenges encountered in the construction business of Keystone, the Company decided to exit
this business line during the third quarter of 2018. This action, along with the exit of the water trucking business line during the first
half of 2018, narrowed the scope of the Keystone business going forward, focusing solely on providing water transfer services. These
factors  prompted  the  impairment  testing  of  Keystone’s  goodwill  and  customer  relationship  intangible  asset  at  September  30,  2018,
resulting in a non-cash, after-tax, impairment charge of  $40 million , net of noncontrolling interest. See  Note 8—Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

•

Looking forward, we expect to invest between $8.0 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 to 2023, including a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion
in 2019 . Our expected future investment includes:

•

•

•

capital investment for infrastructure improvements in our Regulated Businesses of $7.3 billion over the next five years, including $1.6
billion expected in 2019 ;

growth from acquisitions in our Regulated Businesses to expand our water and wastewater customer base of between $600 million to
$1.2 billion over the next five years, including a range of $120 million to $240 million expected in 2019 ; and

strategic capital investments of approximately $100 million over the next five years, which consists primarily of intellectual property
development and strategic growth opportunities in our Market-Based Businesses .

Operational Excellence—We continue to strive for industry-leading operational efficiency, driven largely by technology. Our technology investments
are aimed at enhancing our customer experience and operational efficiency.

•

In 2018 :

•

•

•

•

our  Regulated  Businesses  achieved  an  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  (a  non-GAAP  measure)  of  35.6%  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2018 , compared to 35.3% and 36.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The unfavorability
in our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio in 2018 , when compared to 2017 , was primarily due to a settlement agreement in our New York
subsidiary and higher expenses incurred from the colder weather experienced during the first quarter of 2018. The improvement in our
adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  in  2017 , when compared  to 2016 ,  was  attributable  to  both  an  increase  in  operating  revenues  and  a
decrease in O&M expenses;

we  worked  to  decrease  costs  and  deploy  capital  efficiently,  including  using  trenchless  technologies  for  pipeline  rehabilitation  and
leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drive cost savings;

we  continued  our  commitment  to  water  quality  and  the  environment  by  leveraging  new  technologies;  we  now  have  advanced  water
quality sensors at all of our major drinking water intake sites and we are automating our reporting and compliance systems; and

we  implemented  other  technology  tools  that  will  enhance  communication,  collaboration  and  mobility  to  help  our  employees  work
safely and efficiently, and enhance the customer experience.

•

Looking forward, we will focus on technology and efficiency to:

•

•

be the leader in optimizing technology deployment across the water and wastewater industry, with a keen focus on specific, innovative
projects that will set us apart from other utilities; aiding us in serving our customers with greater ease, making us safer and helping us
operate more efficiently; and

achieve our goal of an adjusted O&M efficiency ratio of 31.5% by 2023.

Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio is defined as the operation and maintenance expenses from our  Regulated Businesses , divided by the pro
forma operating revenues from our  Regulated Businesses , where both operation and maintenance expenses and pro forma operating revenues were
adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Additionally, from operation and maintenance expenses, we excluded the allocable portion of non-
operation and maintenance support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, that are reflected in our Regulated Businesses segment as
operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, are categorized within other line items in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In addition to the adjustments discussed above, for period-to-period comparability purposes, we have presented the estimated impact of the
TCJA on operating revenues for our  Regulated Businesses  on a pro forma basis for all periods presented prior to January 1, 2018, as if the lower
federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  was  in  effect  for  these  periods  (see    Note  7—Regulatory  Assets  and  Liabilities   in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information). We also made the following adjustments to our O&M efficiency ratio: (i) excluded from operation
and maintenance expenses, the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2016, 2017 and 2018; and (ii)
excluded from operation and maintenance expenses, the impact of the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-
07,  Improving

 (“ASU 2017-07”) for 2016, 2017 and
2018. See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We excluded
the items discussed above from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of our
Regulated Businesses .

We  evaluate  our  operating  performance  using  this  ratio  because  we  believe  it  directly  measures  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  our
Regulated Businesses . This information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance. Our adjusted O&M
efficiency ratio is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP, may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should not
be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

With  respect  to  our  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  goal  for  2023,  we  are  unable  to  provide  without  unreasonable  efforts  a  quantitative
reconciliation  of  each  component  of  this  ratio  to  the  most  comparable  financial  measure  calculated  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  calculating  the
components of the ratio, certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.
The  unavailable  information  would  include,  among  other  things,  the  impact  of  items  currently  excluded  from  the  calculation  of  the  components,
adjustments  for  weather  conditions  that  exceed  a  certain  threshold  of  variability  and  adjustments  for  events  or  circumstances  that  may  not  be
reflective of ongoing operating results. The probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated.

The  following  table  provides  the  calculation  of  our  adjusted  O&M  efficiency  ratio  and  a  reconciliation  that  compares  operation  and
maintenance  expenses  and  operating  revenues,  each  as  determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  to  those  amounts  utilized  in  the  calculation  of

Tax Matters

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017 , the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to
the  public  utility  industry,  including  continuation  of  interest  expense  deductibility,  the  exclusion  from  utilizing  bonus  depreciation  and  the  normalization  of
deferred income tax. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operations
and financial position. The portion of this re-measurement related to our Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability, as we believe it is
probable  that  the  deferred  income  tax  excesses  created  by  the  TCJA  will  benefit  our  regulated  customers  in  future  rates.  The  remaining  portion  of  this  re-
measurement of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a non-cash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, we continued
to  gather,  assess  and  evaluate  additional  guidance  and  regulations  related  to  the  changes  related  to  the  TCJA.  As  a  result  of  this  process,  we  have  recorded
additional  adjustments  to  finalize  our  initial  2017  estimates.  See  Note  14—Income  Taxes  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
information.

50

Table of Contents

During 2018, the Company’s 14 regulatory jurisdictions began to consider the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect the
lower income tax rate in 10 states. In one of those 10 states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one additional state, we
are using the tax savings to offset additional capital investment and to reduce a regulatory asset. Proceedings in the other three jurisdictions remain pending. With
respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes, regulators in the eight states that have considered the issue have agreed with our overall timeline of passing
the excess back to customers beginning no earlier than 2019, when the Company is able to produce the normalization schedule using the average rate assumption
method. In one of those states, we will use the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset future infrastructure investments.

On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (the “CAA”). The CAA corrects and clarifies some aspects of the
TCJA  related  to  bonus  depreciation  eligibility.  Specifically,  property  that  was  acquired,  or  the  construction  began,  prior  to  September  27,  2017,  is  eligible  for
bonus depreciation. This clarification allowed the Company to benefit from additional bonus depreciation deductions on the 2017 tax return, and as a result, we
believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expect our federal NOL carryforwards balance will be fully used,
and expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and the
outcome of pending regulatory proceedings regarding the TCJA.

On November 26, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released proposed regulations concerning interest expense limitation rules. The TCJA revised
and  broadened  the  existing  interest  expense  limitation  regulations.  The  Company  has  considered  all  the  rules  set  forth  in  the  proposed  regulation  including
allocated interest expense and interest income based on the relative amounts of the Company’s adjusted basis in the assets used in its excepted and non-excepted
trades or business, or our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses . Based on our interpretation of the new guidance, the Company reasonably believes
the deductibility of its interest expense will not be limited under the new regulations.

Other Tax Matters

On  June  1,  2018,  the  State  of  Missouri  enacted  legislation  that  decreased  the  state  income  tax  rate  on  our  taxable  income  attributable  to  Missouri  from
6.25% to 4.00%, beginning in the 2020 tax year. As a result, we were required to re-measure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the lower state
income tax rate in the second quarter of 2018. This resulted in a decrease to the Company’s unitary deferred income tax liability of $12 million, and an increase to
a regulatory liability of $13 million, as we believe it is probable of refund in future rates.

On May 30, 2018, the State of Iowa enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to Iowa from 12.0% to
9.8%, beginning in the 2021 tax year. The deferred income tax liability for our Iowa subsidiary was reduced by $1 million, and offset by a regulatory liability, as
we believe this liability is probable of refund in future rates.

On April 13, 2018, the State of Kentucky enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to Kentucky from
6%  to  5%,  beginning  in  the  2018  tax  year.  In  addition,  beginning  in  the  2019  tax  year,  a  consolidated  return,  including  all  affiliated  group  members,  will  be
required.  As  a  result,  we  were  required  to  record  a  deferred  income  tax  liability  of  $7  million  for  our  Kentucky  unitary  filing  group,  and  the  existing  deferred
income tax liability related to our Kentucky subsidiary was reduced by $1 million, offset by a regulatory liability, as we believe this liability is probable of refund
in future rates.

The  Company  performed  its  annual  review  of  the  apportionment  rates  in  all  of  its  unitary  filing  jurisdictions  and  implemented  changes  to  reflect
considerations for historical results and future business outlooks in each of the jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018 , we recorded a non-cash, cumulative charge
to earnings of $12 million , resulting from the legislative changes described above and the adjustments made through various state income tax apportionment rates.

On July 1, 2018, the State of New Jersey enacted legislation that increased the corporate business tax rate from 9.0% to 11.5% for the 2018 and 2019 tax
years, and to 10.5% for the 2020 and 2021 tax years. The tax rate will revert back to 9.0% for tax year 2022 and beyond. Additionally, the new legislation states
that for the year beginning on and after January 1, 2019, a unitary group will be required to file a combined unitary New Jersey tax return. The legislation allows a
deduction  over  a  10-year  period,  commencing  five  years  after  the  enactment  of  unitary  combined  reporting,  if  the  combined  reporting  provisions  result  in  an
aggregate increase to the net deferred income tax liability or an aggregate decrease to the net deferred income tax asset. Thus, the deferred income tax liability
resulting from the unitary filing requirement would be completely offset by the deferred income tax asset derived from this deduction. There are no underlying
impacts to the Company’s earnings as a result of the new filing requirement. On October 4, 2018, New Jersey’s governor signed a technical correction bill into law.
The  correction  bill  provides  an  exclusion  for  water  and  wastewater  utility  companies  whose  rates  are  regulated  from  the  combined  reporting  requirement.  The
Company’s tax credit granted by the State of New Jersey will not be impacted by the law changes mentioned above.

Legislative Updates

During 2018, our regulatory jurisdictions enacted legislation as follows:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

House  File  2307  in  Iowa  and  House  Bill  1566  in  Maryland  allow  a  fair  market  value  methodology  to  be  included  in  rate  base  with  respect  to
prospective acquisitions.

Senate  Enrolled  Act  362  in  Indiana,  which,  similar  to  the  Water  Quality  Accountability  Act  enacted  in  New Jersey  in  2017,  sets  new operational
standards  and  requirements  for  water  and  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  areas  such  as  capital  asset  management,  cost-benefit  analysis  and
cybersecurity.

Senate Bill 705 in Missouri allows the Missouri Public Service Commission to approve a revenue stability mechanism (“RSM”) for water utilities. In
an  effort  to  encourage  conservation,  a  RSM  adjusts  rates  periodically  to  ensure  that  a  utility’s  revenue  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  its  costs,  and
customers will not overpay for service.

Senate Bill 592 in Missouri changes the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system to a simple majority for more
than  500  small  towns.  Historically,  only  larger  communities  required  a  simple  majority,  while  smaller  communities  needed  a  two-thirds
majority. This legislation increases the options for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale.

Legislation was passed in Iowa that allows private water utilities to use a future test year approach in rate cases, decreasing potential regulatory lag
and helping to spread out the time between rate cases.

In California, Assembly Bill 2179 changed the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems to a simple majority as compared to a two-thirds
majority, and Assembly Bill 2339 allowed certain cities to sell water systems without an election.

Act 58 of 2018 in Pennsylvania allows public utilities to implement alternative rates and rate mechanisms in rate base proceedings. These alternative
rates and rate mechanisms include, but are not limited to the following: revenue stability mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates, multi-
year rate plans, or a combination of those mechanisms or other mechanisms. Petitions to establish alternative rate mechanisms are subject to PUC
review and approval and can only be filed by a utility in a rate base proceeding.

On October 17, 2018, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that allows an investor-owned water utility to include the replacement
costs for customer-owned LSLs and customer-owned damaged wastewater laterals in rate base when replaced as part of a Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission  approved  program.  The  law  became  effective  December  23,  2018.  Prior  to  the  new  law,  our  Pennsylvania  subsidiary  sought  the
approval of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to revise the Company’s rules to permit it to replace customer-owned LSLs and to recover
associated costs. Our Pennsylvania subsidiary’s proposed replacement of customer-owned LSL program is being reviewed under the provisions of
the new law.

On October  23,  2018, President  Trump  signed  America’s  Water  Infrastructure  Act  of  2018. The  legislation  includes  policies  intended  to  improve
water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess options for consolidation for systems that do not comply with the
federal  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  and  its  rules  and  regulations.  The  legislation  increases  funding  to  water  system  funding  programs,  including  the
State Revolving Loan Fund program and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act.

$

In 2018 , net income attributable to common shareholders increased $141 million , or 33.1 percent , compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was
due to a $125 million non-cash charge in 2017 related to the implementation of TCJA, continued growth in the  Regulated Businesses , driven by infrastructure
investment, acquisitions and organic growth and growth in the  Market-Based Businesses , mainly from our  Homeowner Services Group  due to the mid-year
acquisition of Pivotal. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expenses across the Company due to growth of the business and the
asset impairment charge recorded for our Keystone subsidiary during the third quarter of 2018.

In 2017 , net income attributable to common shareholders decreased $42 million , or 9.0 percent , as compared to the same period in 2016. This decrease
was due to a $125 million non-cash charge in 2017 related to the implementation of TCJA resulting from the re-measurement of deferred taxes primarily at the
parent company from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% . Partially offsetting this non-cash charge was continued growth in
the  Regulated Businesses  driven mainly by infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth, combined with growth in the   Market-Based Businesses
 mainly from the Homeowner Services Group and Keystone.

Segment Results of Operations

Our operating segments are comprised of the revenue-generating components of the business for which separate financial information is internally produced
and regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through
one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. We also operate several market-based businesses within operating segments that individually do not
meet  the  criteria  of  a  reportable  segment  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  These  non-reportable  operating  segments  are  collectively  presented  as  our  Market-Based
Businesses , which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

In 2018 , operating revenues increased $26 million , or 0.9% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

$149  million  increase  from  authorized  rate  increases,  including  infrastructure  surcharges,  principally  to  fund  infrastructure  investment  in  various
states;

$22 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems; and

$148 million  decrease from the impacts of the TCJA which have or are expected to benefit customers. This decrease is made up of two components:
(i)  a  reserve  on  revenue  billed  during  2018,  for  the  estimated  income  tax  savings  expected  to  benefit  customers  in  future  rates;  and  (ii)  rate
adjustments made in certain subsidiaries where our Regulators have authorized lower rates or offsets to regulatory assets or capital investments to
pass the benefits to customers.

In 2017 , operating revenues increased $87 million , or 3.0% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

•

$81  million  increase  from  authorized  rate  increases,  including  infrastructure  surcharges,  principally  to  fund  infrastructure  investment  in  various
states;

$43 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems; and

$9 million increase from higher wastewater treatment volumes and an increase in private fire service connections; partially offset by a

$48 million decrease from lower water services demand, including a $15 million reduction due to warmer weather in 2016.

were mandated in 2015 due to the state’s extreme drought, being lifted in the second quarter of 2017; and

$2 million increase in waste disposal from higher sludge removal costs in our Illinois and Missouri subsidiaries.

In 2018 , employee-related costs increased $20 million , or 4.6% , primarily due to a:

•

•

$15 million increase in salaries and wages to support growth of the business, as well as an increase in overtime related to a higher volume of main
breaks during the first quarter of 2018, the result of harshly frigid weather in the Midwest, Northeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic; and

$5 million increase in pensions from an authorized change in regulatory recovery of pension expense in our Pennsylvania subsidiary.

In 2017 , employee-related costs remained consistent primarily due to a:

•

•

$5 million increase in other benefits from higher employer 401(k) savings plan contributions and an increase in training costs; partially offset by a

$4 million decrease in pensions from higher capitalization rates in 2017.

Operating
Supplies
and
Services

In 2018 , operating supplies and services increased $18 million , or 8.6% , primarily due to a $17 million increase in contracted services from higher costs
for  various  legal  matters  including  a  settlement  agreement  in  our  New  York  subsidiary  and  costs  associated  with  condemnation  proceedings  in  Monterey,
California, higher costs from temporary workers as a result of restructuring initiatives in our technology support services, as well as an increase in other operating
expenses.

In 2017 , operating supplies and services decreased $3 million , or 1.4% , primarily due to a decrease in charges recorded in 2016, including a $5 million
write-off of timekeeping system costs that were previously capitalized and a $7 million judgment in litigation, partially offset by an increase in office supplies and
services from higher employee relocation, telecommunication and office supplies costs.

Maintenance
Materials
and
Supplies

In 2018 , maintenance materials and supplies increased $11 million , or 15.7% , from a higher volume of main breaks and paving costs, driven by the colder
weather experienced during the first quarter of 2018, as well as higher tank painting costs in our New Jersey subsidiary and various maintenance projects in our
Pennsylvania, Missouri and Indiana subsidiaries.

In 2017 , maintenance materials and supplies decreased $3 million , or 4.1% , from lower tank painting costs in our New Jersey subsidiary and the timing of

maintenance activities.

Customer
Billing
and
Accounting

In  2018  ,  customer  billing  and  accounting  increased  $9  million  ,  or  17.6%  ,  from  an  increase  in  customer  uncollectible  expense,  primarily  in  our

Pennsylvania, Missouri and New York subsidiaries, and higher call volumes experienced at our customer service centers.

56

Table of Contents

In 2017 ,  customer  billing  and  accounting  decreased  $3  million  or 5.6% ,  from  lower  customer  uncollectible  expense  attributable  to  focused  collection

efforts.

Other
(Operation
and
Maintenance)

In 2018 , other (operation and maintenance) increased $10 million , or 58.8% , primarily due to higher casualty insurance claims in 2018, and a $3 million
charge from a regulatory authorization allowing a portion of the income tax savings resulting from the TCJA to be used to reduce certain regulatory assets. During
2018, we recorded a $20 million benefit resulting from an insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers associated with the Freedom
Industries chemical spill in West Virginia.

In 2017 , other (operation and maintenance) decreased $90 million , or 84.1% , primarily due to a $65 million net charge recorded in 2016, resulting from
the  binding  global  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  claims  associated  with  the  Freedom  Industries  chemical  spill  in  West  Virginia,  and  a  $22  million  benefit
recorded  in  2017,  resulting  from  a  related  insurance  settlement  with  one  of  our  general  liability  insurance  carriers,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  casualty  insurance
expense attributable to a lower claims experience in 2017.

Depreciation and Amortization

In  2018 and 2017 , depreciation and amortization increased   $38 million and $22 million , or 8.2% and 5.0% , respectively. The increase for both periods

was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service.

General Taxes

In    2018 and 2017 ,  general  taxes    increased $17  million  and $2  million  ,  or  7.0% and 0.8% ,  respectively.  The  increase  in  2018  was  primarily  due  to

incremental property taxes in several of our subsidiaries, including in Missouri and New York.

(Gain) on Asset Dispositions and Purchases

In  2018 and 2017 , (gain) on asset dispositions and purchases increased $9 million , or 56.3% , and decreased $9 million , or 128.6% , respectively. The

decrease  in  2018  was  primarily  due  to  higher  gains  recognized  in  2017,  including  a  $7  million  gain  on  a  land  sale  in  our  Kentucky  subsidiary,  along  with
acquisition and land sale gains in our Pennsylvania, Missouri and California subsidiaries, partially offset by gains recognized in 2018 for the sale of a treatment
plant in our Illinois subsidiary and a building in our New Jersey subsidiary.

Interest, net

In 2018 and 2017 ,  interest,  net  increased  $12  million  and $12  million  ,  respectively.  The  increase  in  interest  expense  during  2018  was  driven  by  the
issuance of incremental  long-term  debt in the third quarter  of 2018 to support growth of the business, and higher levels of short-term  borrowings during 2018,
coupled with an increase in the average short-term borrowing rate in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in interest expense was
driven by the issuance of incremental long-term debt in 2017 to support growth of the business.

Other Income (Expenses)

In 2018 , other income (expenses) increased $19 million , or 7.1% , primarily due to a reduction in the non-service cost components of pension and other
postretirement  benefits  expense  resulting  from  favorable  actuarial  performance,  and  an  increase  in  allowance  for  funds  used  during  construction  attributable  to
higher capital investment in 2018, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the increase in
other income (expenses) was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as discussed above.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the year ended  December 31, 2018 , our provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate
from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, resulting from the enactment of the TCJA. We expect the reduced tax rate will benefit our customers through established
ratemaking, tax and regulatory normalization provisions. During 2018, we continued assessing the impacts of the TCJA as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin
118 (“SAB 118”), and as a result we recorded adjustments to federal and state income tax TCJA estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our provision
for income taxes increased primarily due to higher pretax income in 2017 compared to 2016.

Operating Revenues

In 2018 , operating revenues increased $54 million , or 12.8% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

•

$76 million increase in our Homeowner Services Group from contract growth, including $67 million from the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 ;
and

$6  million  increase  in  Keystone  from  an  increase  in  water  transfer  operations  resulting  from  market  recovery  in  the  shale  natural  gas  industry;
partially offset by a

$16 million decrease in our Military Services Group from lower capital upgrades; and

$14 million decrease in our Contract Services Group from the sale of the majority of our O&M contracts to subsidiaries of Veolia Environnement
S.A. during the third quarter of 2018.

In 2017 , operating revenues decreased $29 million , or 6.4% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

•

$56 million decrease in our Military Services Group from lower capital upgrades, largely driven by reduced military base budgets and the completion
of a large project in the first half of 2017 at Fort Polk; and

$6 million decrease in our Contract Services Group from the completion of several O&M contracts during 2017; partially offset by a

$18 million increase in our Homeowner Services Group from contract growth, as well as expansion into new geographic areas and price increases for
existing customers; and

$16 million increase in Keystone due to an increase in operations resulting from market recovery in the shale natural gas industry.

In 2018 , operation and maintenance expense increased $25 million , or 7.4% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

$7 million increase in employee-related costs mainly in our Homeowner Services Group related to the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 , partly
offset by lower costs in our Contract Services Group resulting from the sale of the majority of our O&M contracts during the third quarter of 2018;
and

$21  million  increase  in  operating  supplies  and  services  from  the  acquisition  of  Pivotal  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expense  in  our
Homeowner Services Group , as well as an increase in water transfer operations in Keystone, offset in part by lower capital upgrades in our Military
Services Group and the sale of the majority of our Contract Services Group ’s O&M contracts during the third quarter of 2018, as discussed above;
partially offset by a

$5 million decrease in production costs from lower purchased water and chemical usage in our Contract Services Group resulting from the sale of the
majority of our O&M contracts during the third quarter of 2018.

In 2017 , operation and maintenance expense decreased $35 million , or 9.4% , primarily due to a:

•

•

•

$44 million decrease in operating supplies and services from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group , as discussed above, as well as
lower advertising and marketing expense in our Homeowner Services Group ; partially offset by a

$3 million increase in employee-related costs from higher headcount in Keystone from an increase in operations, as discussed above, offset in part in
our Contract Services Group from the completion of several O&M contracts during 2017; and

$5 million increase in other (operating and maintenance expense) from an increase in customer uncollectible expense in our Homeowner Services
Group resulting from contract growth in 2017.

Depreciation and Amortization

In 2018 and 2017 ,  depreciation  and  amortization  increased $11  million  and $3  million  ,  or  61.1% and 20.0% ,  respectively.  The  increase  in  2018 was

primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 .

(Gain) on Asset Dispositions and Purchases

In 2018 , (gain) on asset dispositions and purchases increased $13 million primarily due to the (gain) recognized on the sale of the majority of our  Contract
Services Group ’s O&M contracts to subsidiaries of Veolia Environnement S.A. during the third quarter of 2018, partially offset by a loss recognized on the sale of
property,  plant  and  equipment  in  Keystone.  See  Note  4—Acquisitions  and  Divestitures  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
information regarding the Veolia Environnement S.A. transaction.

Impairment Charge

During the third quarter of 2018, a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $57 million was recorded for Keystone, the result of operational and
financial challenges encountered in the construction business, and the Company’s determination to narrow the scope of the Keystone business, to focus on its core
operations  of  providing  water  transfer  services.  See    Note  8—Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets   in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information.

Provision for Income Taxes

In 2018 and 2017 , provision for income taxes  decreased $17 million , or 60.7% , and increased $2 million , or 7.7% , respectively. The decrease in 2018

was primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We  regularly  evaluate  and  monitor  our  cash  requirements  for  capital  investments,  acquisitions,  operations,  commitments,  debt  maturities,  interest  and
dividends.  Our  business  is  capital  intensive,  with  a  majority  of  this  capital  funded  by  cash  flows  from  operations.  When  necessary,  we  also  obtain  funds  from
external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. Our
access  to  external  financing  on  reasonable  terms  depends  on  our  credit  ratings  and  current  business  conditions,  including  that  of  the  utility  and  water  utility
industry  in  general,  as  well  as  conditions  in  the  debt  or  equity  capital  markets,  and  the  national  and  international  economic  and  geopolitical  arenas.  If  these
business, market, financial  and other conditions deteriorate  to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital  markets on reasonable  terms, we have
access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion , with an expiration date of June 2023 (subject to extension by us
for up to two one-year periods). We rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs, to issue letters of credit
and  to  support  our  $2.10  billion  commercial  paper  program.  Disruptions  in  the  credit  markets  may  discourage  lenders  from  extending  the  terms  of  such
commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets. See “Credit
Facilities and Short-Term Debt” section below for additional information.

In order to meet our short-term liquidity needs, we, through AWCC, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, issue commercial paper, which is supported by
the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018 , AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $81 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving
credit  facility,  with  $2.25  billion  available  to  fulfill  our  short-term  liquidity  needs  and  to  issue  letters  of  credit,  which  supported  $954  million  in outstanding
commercial paper. We believe that our ability to access the capital markets, our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient
cash to fund our short-term requirements. We have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exception
of  privately  or  investor-owned  acquisitions  whose  sellers  require  equity  to  complete  the  acquisition  or  other  opportunistic  acquisitions.  We  believe  we  have
sufficient  liquidity  and  the  ability  to  manage  our  expenditures,  should  there  be  a  disruption  of  the  capital  and  credit  markets.  However,  we  can  provide  no
assurances that the lenders will meet their existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercial
paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.

In addition, our Regulated Businesses receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction
necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refundable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customers
begin  to  receive  service  or  other  contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Amounts  which  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions  in  aid  of
construction.  Utility  plant  funded  by  advances  and  contributions  is  excluded  from  our  Regulated  Businesses  rate  base.  Generally,  we  depreciate  contributed
property  and amortize  contributions  in  aid of  construction  at  the composite  rate  of  the related  property.  Some  of our  subsidiaries  do not depreciate  contributed
property,  based  upon  regulatory  guidelines.  The  taxability  of  advances  and  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was  changed  with  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA.
Previously,  the  majority  of  advances  and  contributions  that  we  collected  were  not  taxable;  however,  with  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA,  they  are  now  treated  as
taxable income. Regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the TCJA has been resolved by most of our regulatory jurisdictions in a manner that
passes the tax consequences of the change in law to the customer making the advance or contribution, or allows the utility to pass those consequences onto a larger
base of customers. We are working with the remaining regulatory jurisdictions to determine impacts to the Company and our customers.

We use our capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay
dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) we estimate beginning at the end of 2019, to pay federal income
taxes. We invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, we operate in
rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended
period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business — Regulated Businesses — Economic Regulation and Rate
Making for additional information. We expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash
flows from operations. Since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than our cash flows from operating activities, we have no
plans to reduce debt significantly. If necessary, we may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, or pursue financing from other sources to
preserve  liquidity.  In  this  event,  we  believe  we  can  rely  upon  cash  flows  from  operations  to  meet  our  obligations  and  fund  our  minimum  required  capital
investments for an extended period of time.

With  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA  and  the  reduction  of  the  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  35% to 21% ,  we  anticipate  a  decrease  in  future
revenue authorizations associated with our Regulated Businesses , initially leading to lower cash flows. We expect this cash flow impact to decline over time, as
our Regulated Businesses ’ rate base grows, the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities, which offset rate base. The lower deferred income tax liabilities are
mainly due to (i) a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, (ii) the normalization (refunding to customers) of the re-measured deferred income tax liabilities
over the remaining life of the associated assets, and (iii) the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after September 27, 2017.

The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (“WIFIA”) established the WIFIA program, a federal credit program administered by the EPA
for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program accelerates investment in our nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term,
low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects. Our letters of interest have been approved by the EPA, and we have begun the full
application process for two WIFIA loans totaling $187 million for two separate projects in our Missouri subsidiary.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities

Cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  primarily  result  from  the  sale  of  water  and  wastewater  services  and,  due  to  the  seasonality  of  demand,  are
generally  greater  during  the  warmer  months.  Our  future  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities  will  be  affected  by,  among  other  things;  economic  utility
regulation inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; maintenance costs; customer growth; declining customer usage
of water; employee-related costs, including pension funding; weather and seasonality; taxes; and overall economic conditions.

We  expect  that  the  enactment  of  the  TCJA  to  be  accretive  to  our  consolidated  earnings  over  time  through  (i)  growth  in  rate  base  for  the  same  level  of
expected capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the re-measurement of our deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, (ii) increased earnings in our Market-Based Businesses due to the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, all partially offset by (iii) the lower tax
shield  on  interest  expense  at  the  parent,  as  well  as  increased  debt  levels  from  lower  cash  flows  from  operations  as  we  pass  the  lower  tax  rate  benefits  to  our
regulated customers. We believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019, when we expect our federal NOL carryforwards
balance will be fully used, and expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020, although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future
results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the TCJA.

Cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of funding, sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majority
of our capital investments. We expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital investment, if any, and fund our dividend payments,
as needed. We also have access to equity capital markets, if needed. We do not foresee the need to access equity markets over the next five years under normal
operating conditions. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments, changes in our Market-Based Businesses ,
changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and our customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. We can
provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future. Sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets mainly from
debt maturities due within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund
acquisitions  and  construction  projects,  as  well  as  cash  needs  which  can  fluctuate  significantly  due  to  the  seasonality  of  the  business.  We  address  cash  timing
differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms.

component can be found on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

(b)

Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net.

In 2018 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $63 million , primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the enactment of the TCJA and
changes  in  working  capital.  These  decreases  are  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  net  income.  The  main  factors  contributing  to  the  net  income  increase  are
described in this section under “Consolidated Results of Operations” and included higher operating revenue and a lower provision for income taxes.

In 2017 , cash flows provided by operations increased $160 million , primarily due to an increase in net income after non-cash adjustments, including the
impact of the enactment of the TCJA, and an increase in cash flows from working capital. The main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in
the  “Consolidated  Results  of  Operations”  section  and  include  higher  operating  revenues,  partially  offset  by  higher  income  taxes  due  to  a  $125  million  re-
measurement charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the Company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the TCJA. The
increase  in  non-cash  activities  was  mainly  attributable  to  the  increase  in  deferred  income  taxes,  as  mentioned  above,  and  an  increase  in  depreciation  and
amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service. The change in working capital was principally due to (i) the timing of accounts payable and accrued
liabilities,  including  the  accrual  recorded  during  2016  for  the  binding  global  agreement  in  principle  to  settle  claims  associated  with  the  Freedom  Industries
chemical  spill  in  West  Virginia,  (ii)  a  decrease  in  unbilled  revenues  as  a  result  of  our  Military  Services  Group  achieving  significant  capital  project  milestones
during  2016,  and  (iii)  a  change  in  other  current  assets  and  liabilities,  including  the  decrease  in  other  current  assets  associated  with  the  termination  of
our four forward starting swap agreements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts.

The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of up to $31 million in 2019 . In addition, we estimate that contributions will amount
to $32 million , $29 million , $29 million and $29 million in 2020 , 2021 , 2022 and 2023 , respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from
these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.

In 2018 and 2017 ,  cash  flows  used  in  investing  activities  increased  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  our  regulated  capital  expenditures,  principally  from
incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure in our Regulated Businesses , as well as
acquisitions in both our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses , as discussed below.

Our  infrastructure  investment  plan  consists  of  both  infrastructure  renewal  programs,  where  we  replace  infrastructure,  as  needed,  and  major  capital
investment projects, where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations.
Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.

In 2018 , our capital expenditures increased $152 million , or 10.6% , primarily due to investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories. In

2017 , our capital expenditures increased $123 million , or 9.4% , primarily due to investment in our general structure and equipment and wastewater categories.

We also grow our business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems, as well as other water-related services. These acquisitions are
complementary  to  our  existing  business  and  support  continued  geographical  diversification  and  growth  of  our  operations.  Generally,  acquisitions  are  funded
initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt.

The majority of cash paid for acquisitions pertained to the $365 million purchase of Pivotal within our Homeowner Services Group .

Paid $33 million for 15 water and wastewater systems, representing approximately 14,000 customers.

Received $35 million for the sale of assets, including $27 million for the sale of the majority of the O&M contracts in our Contract Services Group
during the third quarter of 2018.

The  majority  of  cash paid  for  acquisitions  pertained  to the  $159 million purchase  of the  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  assets  of  the
Municipal  Authority  of  the  City  of  McKeesport,  Pennsylvania  (the  “McKeesport  system”),  excluding  a  $5 million non-escrowed  deposit  made  in
2016.

Paid $18 million for 16 water and wastewater systems, excluding the McKeesport system and Shorelands (a stock-for-stock transaction), representing
approximately 7,000 customers.

Received $15 million for the sale of assets.

Paid $199 million for 15 water and wastewater systems, representing approximately 42,000 customers.

Made a non-escrowed deposit of $5 million related to the McKeesport system acquisition.

Received $9 million for the sale of assets.

As  previously  noted,  we  expect  to  invest  between  $8.0  billion  to  $8.6  billion  from  2019  to  2023  ,  with  $7.3  billion  of  this  range  for  infrastructure
improvements  in  our  Regulated  Businesses  .  In  2019  ,  we  expect  to  invest  between  a  range  of  $1.7  billion  to  $1.8  billion  in  2019  ,  with  $1.6  billion  for
infrastructure  improvements  in  our  Regulated  Businesses  .  Also  in  2019  ,  we  expect  to  invest  between  $120  million  to  $240  million  for  acquisitions  in  our
Regulated Businesses .

Includes  proceeds  from  issuances  of  common  stock  under  various  employee  stock  plans  and  our  dividend  reinvestment  plan,  net  of  taxes  paid,  advances  and  contributions  for
construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premium on early debt redemption.

In 2018, cash flows provided by financing  activities  increased $519 million , primarily  due to  the issuance  of common  stock to finance  a portion  of the
purchase  price  of  the  Pivotal  acquisition  and  a  decrease  in  cash  used  for  short-term  borrowings.  Short-term  borrowings  were  used  to  fund  the  growth  of  our
Regulated Businesses , finance approximately 50% of the Pivotal acquisition, pay dividends and repay long-term debt, offset by the use of the  $1.325 billion  long-
term debt issuance to support growth of the business and repay short-term borrowings.

Our  financing  activities,  primarily  focused  on  funding  regulated  infrastructure  expenditures,  regulated  and  market-based  acquisitions  and  payment  of
dividends.  These  activities  included  the  issuance  of  long-term  and  short-term  debt,  primarily  through  AWCC  and  in  2018,  included  an  equity  issuance  for
approximately 50% of the Pivotal acquisition. In addition, new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction, net
of refunds, which amounted to $21 million , $28 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Based on the
needs of our Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans,
provide  those  borrowings  to  the  Regulated  Businesses  and  the  parent  company.  The  Regulated  Businesses  and  the  parent  company  are  obligated  to  pay  their
portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. The parent company’s
borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses , therefore, the parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through
regulated  water  and  wastewater  rates.  As  of  December  31,  2018  ,  AWCC  has  made  long-term  fixed  rate  loans  and  commercial  paper  loans  to  our  Regulated
Businesses amounting to $4.4 billion and $392 million , respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018 , AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and
commercial paper loans to the parent company amounting $1.7 billion and $533 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , the parent company has made
long-term fixed rate loans to our Market-Based Businesses amounting to $183 million related to the acquisition of Pivotal on June 4, 2018 .

On    August  9,  2018  ,  AWCC  completed  a    $1.325  billion   debt  offering  which  included  the  sale  of    $625  million   aggregate  principal  amount  of  its
unsecured  3.75%  Senior Notes due in 2028, and  $700 million  aggregate principal amount of its unsecured  4.20%  Senior Notes due in 2048. At the closing of
the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion .
AWCC used proceeds from the offering to (i) lend funds to American Water and its regulated operating subsidiaries, (ii) repay $191 million principal amount of
AWCC’s 5.62% Senior Notes due 2018 upon maturity on December 21, 2018, (iii) prepay $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.62%
Series E Senior Notes due March 29, 2019 (the “Series E Notes”) and $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding 5.77% Series F Senior
Notes due March 29, 2022 (the “Series F Notes,” and, together with the Series E Notes, the “Series Notes”), and (iv) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations
and for general corporate purposes.

As a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $10 million was paid to the holders thereof on September 11, 2018.
Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to our utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as we believe they are probable
of recovery in future rates.

On August 6, 2018 , the Company terminated four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  $400 million , realizing a net

gain of  $9 million , to be amortized through interest, net over 10 - and  30 -year periods, in correlation with the terms of the new debt issued on August 9, 2018 .

On August 17, 2018 , we entered into two forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $80 million , to reduce interest rate exposure
on  debt  expected  to  be  issued  in  2019.  These  forward  starting  swap  agreements  terminate  in  August  2019  and  have  an  average  fixed  rate  of    2.98%  .  On
October 11, 2018 , we entered into two additional forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $100 million , to reduce interest rate exposure
on  debt  expected  to  be  issued  in  2019.  These  forward  starting  swap  agreements  terminate  in  December 2019 ,  and  have  an  average  fixed  rate  of    3.31% . On
January 8, 2019 , we entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement, with a notional amount of  $150 million , to reduce interest rate exposure on debt
expected to be issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in December 2019 , and has an average fixed rate of  2.76% . We have designated
these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. Upon termination, the
cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt.

One  of  the  principal  market  risks  to  which  the  Company  is  exposed  is  changes  in  interest  rates.  In  order  to  manage  the  exposure,  we  follow  risk
management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. We reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper
and debt maturities. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into
are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet
their  contractual  obligations.  We  minimize  the  counterparty  credit  risk  on  these  transactions  by  only  dealing  with  leading,  credit-worthy  financial  institutions,
having long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.

On April 11, 2018 , we effected an equity forward transaction by entering into a forward sale agreement with each of two forward purchasers in connection
with a public offering of 2,320,000 shares of our common stock. In the equity forward transaction, the forward purchasers, or an affiliate, borrowed an aggregate of
2,320,000 shares  of  our  common  stock  from  third  parties  and  sold  them  to  the  underwriters  in  the  public  offering.  On  June  7, 2018  ,  we  elected  to  fully  and
physically  settle  both forward  sale  agreements,  resulting  in the  issuance  of  a total  of  2,320,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $79.01 per share, for
aggregate net proceeds of $183 million . The net proceeds of the transaction were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the Pivotal acquisition on June 4,
2018 .

In May 2018, the parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through

From time to time and as market conditions warrant, we may engage in long-term debt retirements through tender offers, open market repurchases or other

viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets.

In February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive, common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our
dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of
its outstanding common stock, over an unrestricted period of time, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is conducted in
accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and to facilitate the repurchases, we have also entered into Rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plans with a third-
party broker, which allows us to repurchase  shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-
imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters
at our discretion. As of December 31, 2018 , we have repurchased an aggregate of 4,510,000 shares of common stock under this program.

Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt

We have an unsecured revolving credit facility of $2.25 billion that expires in June 2023. In March 2018, AWCC and its lenders amended and restated the
credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility to increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion ,
and  to  extend  the  expiration  date  of  the  facility  from  June  2020  to  March  2023.  All  other  terms,  conditions  and  covenants  with  respect  to  the  existing  facility
remained unchanged. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by
up to an aggregate of  $500 million , and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two, one-year periods.

Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s and

Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to
support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes
of a support agreement between the Company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by the Company of AWCC’s payment
obligations under the credit facility.

AWCC also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility, the maximum aggregate outstanding amount of

which was increased in March 2018, from $1.60 billion to $2.10 billion .

The following table provides the aggregate credit facility commitments, letter of credit sub-limit under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper

The changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in long-term debt.

Debt Covenants

Our debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default
may occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our revolving
credit facility. Our long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured
by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.

Covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as
defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2018 , our ratio was 0.59 to 1.00 and therefore we were in compliance with the
covenants.

Security Ratings

Our access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by our
securities  ratings.  We  primarily  access  the  debt  capital  markets,  including  the  commercial  paper  market,  through  AWCC.  However,  we  have  also  issued  debt
through our regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower our overall cost of debt.

The following table provides our long-term and short-term credit rating and rating outlook as of February 19, 2019 :

On  June  11,  2018,  Standard  &  Poor’s  Ratings  Service  affirmed  the  Company’s  long-term  ‘A’  and  short-term  ‘A-1’  credit  ratings,  with  a  stable  outlook

remaining unchanged.

On January 19, 2018, Moody’s Investors Service changed its rating outlook to negative, from stable, for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies,

including the Company, all of which were primarily impacted by the enactment of the TCJA.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an
amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans. We can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain
our  existing  ratings.  None  of  our  borrowings  are  subject  to  default  or  prepayment  as  a  result  of  the  downgrading  of  these  security  ratings,  although  such  a
downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility.

Table of Contents

As part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. These
contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  us  and  our  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  future  performance  when  there  are
reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such
downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for
adequate  assurance  of  future  performance,  which  could  include  a  demand  that  we  provide  collateral  to  secure  our  obligations.  We  do  not  expect  to  post  any
collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Dividends and Regulatory Restrictions

For  discussion  of  our  dividends,  dividend  restrictions  and  dividend  policy,  see  Note  9—Shareholders'  Equity  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial

Statements for additional information.

Insurance Coverage

We  carry  various  property,  casualty  and  financial  insurance  policies  with  limits,  deductibles  and  exclusions  that  we  believe  are  consistent  with  industry
standards.  However,  insurance  coverage  may  not  be  adequate  or  available  to  cover  unanticipated  losses  or  claims.  Additionally,  annual  policy  renewals  can  be
impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are
within  the  policy  deductible  or  exceed  the  amount  of  insurance  maintained.  Such  losses  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  short-term  and  long-term
financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Public-Private
Partnerships

WVAWC  has  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  various  public  entities,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  Partners,  to  establish  certain  joint  ventures,
commonly referred to as “public-private partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, WVAWC constructed utility plant, financed by WVAWC, and the
Partners  constructed  utility  plant  (connected  to  WVAWC’s  property),  financed  by  the  Partners.  WVAWC  agreed  to  transfer  and  convey  some  of  its  real  and
personal  property  to  the  Partners  in  exchange  for  an  equal  principal  amount  of  Industrial  Development  Bonds,  commonly  referred  to  as  IDBs,  issued  by  the
Partners  under a state Industrial  Development  Bond and Commercial  Development  Act. WVAWC leased back the total facilities,  including portions funded by
both WVAWC and the Partners, under leases for a period of 40 years.

The  leases  have  payments  that  approximate  the  payments  required  by  the  terms  of  the  IDBs.  These  payments  are  considered  “PILOT  payments”  which
represent payments that WVAWC otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties. We have presented the transaction on a net basis on the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The carrying value of the transferred facilities, which is presented in property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
approximately $147 million as of December 31, 2018 .

Performance
Obligations

We  have entered  into agreements  for the  provision  of services  to water  and wastewater  facilities  for the United States  military,  municipalities  and other
customers.  For  discussion  of  our  performance  obligations  see  Note  3—Revenue  Recognition  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional
information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and
judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions
and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates
and  assumptions  in  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  that  may  change  in  subsequent  periods.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the  estimates,  assumptions  and
judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in our
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Management  has  reviewed  the  critical  accounting  polices  described  below  with  our  Audit,  Finance  and  Risk  Committee,
including  the  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments  used  in  their  application.  Additional  discussion  regarding  these  critical  accounting  policies  and  their
application can be found in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation and Regulatory Accounting

Our regulated utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by PUCs and, as such, we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate
regulated  utilities,  which  requires  us  to  reflect  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Use  of  this  authoritative  guidance  is
applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates
will be set to recover the estimated  costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment,  or rate base. As of  December 31, 2018 , we concluded that the
operations of our utilities met the criteria.

Application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. We
make significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets
and  liabilities  related  to  regulated  acquisitions,  pension  and  postretirement  benefits,  depreciation  rates  and  taxes.  Due  to  timing  and  other  differences  in  the
collection  of  revenues,  these  authoritative  accounting  principles  allow  a  cost  that  would  otherwise  be  charged  as  an  expense  by  a  non-regulated  entity,  to  be
deferred  as  a  regulatory  asset  if  it  is  probable  that  such  cost  is  recoverable  through  future  rates.  Conversely,  the  principles  require  the  creation  of  a  regulatory
liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to
customers. Regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties.

For  each  regulatory  jurisdiction  where  we  conduct  business,  we  assess,  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  whether  the  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities
continue to meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory
environments; recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending
or potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no
longer meet the criteria for probable, future recovery or settlement, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected.
In  addition,  if  we  conclude  in  a  future  period  that  a  separable  portion  of  the  business  no  longer  meets  the  criteria,  we  are  required  to  eliminate  the  financial
statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents

On December 22, 2017 , the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code
of  1986,  including  a  reduction  in  the  maximum  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate  from  35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created  significant
excess deferred income taxes that we and our regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers. As such, we recorded these amounts as regulatory
liabilities.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , our regulatory asset balance was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, and our regulatory liability balance was
$1.9 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
regarding our significant regulatory assets and liabilities.

Goodwill

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , our goodwill balances were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. In accordance with GAAP, goodwill must be
allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for impairment at least annually. We perform our
annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30 of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Adverse industry or economic trends, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline
in our market capitalization, among other things, may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues, requiring further testing of a reporting unit’s carrying
value.

Entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary.
In performing a qualitative assessment, we assess and make judgments, among other things, around macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions,
overall  financial  performance,  cost  factors  and  entity  specific  events.  These  factors  require  significant  judgment  and  estimates,  and  application  of  alternative
assumptions could produce significantly different results. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more
likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If we bypass the qualitative assessment, or perform the qualitative assessment and
determine that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This
quantitative  test  compares  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  to  its  respective  net  carrying  value,  including  goodwill,  on  the  measurement  date.  An
impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total
amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of
reporting units. We estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in
these fair value analyses include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates, working
capital,  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  projected  terminal  values.  Changes  in  estimates  or  the  application  of  alternative  assumptions  could  produce
significantly  different  results.  See Note  8—Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information
regarding our goodwill.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived  assets  include  property,  plant  and  equipment,  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-term  investments.  We  evaluate  our  long-lived  assets  for
impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
decrease in the market value of the asset, a change in the asset’s expected useful life or physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated
with the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or is planned to be used. When such indicators arise, we
estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, and
compare  the  estimated  value  fair  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset.  An  impairment  loss  will  be  recognized  in  the  amount  equal  to  the  excess  of  the  long-lived
asset’s  carrying  value  compared  to  its  estimated  fair  value.  Key  variables  that  must  be  estimated  include  assumptions  regarding  sales  volume,  rates,  operating
costs,  labor  and  other  benefit  costs,  capital  additions,  assumed  discount  rates  and  other  economic  factors.  These  variables  require  management  judgment  and
include  inherent  uncertainties,  since  they  are  forecasting  future  events.  A  variation  in  the  assumptions  used  could  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  regarding  the
realizability of a long-lived asset and, thus, could have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The long-lived assets of our Regulated Businesses are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations
that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of
that asset is no longer probable.

The Company holds other investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The estimated fair value of the
long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the
external  markets.  If  such  long-term  investments  are  considered  impaired,  an  impairment  loss  will  be  recognized  in  the  amount  equal  to  the  excess  of  the
investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.

71

Table of Contents

The  Company  believes  the  assumptions  and  other  considerations  used  to  value  long-lived  assets  to  be  appropriate,  however,  if  actual  experience  differs
from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  is  generated  primarily  from  water  and  wastewater  services  delivered  to  customers.  These  contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately
identifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  are
generally  no significant  financing  components  or  variable  consideration.  Revenues include  amounts  billed  to  customers  on a  cycle  basis,  and unbilled  amounts
calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts
that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value
transferred to the customer.

Increases  or  decreases  in  the  volumes  delivered  to  customers  and  rate  mix  due  to  changes  in  usage  patterns  in  customer  classes  in  the  period  could  be
significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for
each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for our regulated utilities as of December 31, 2018 and
2017 was $144 million and $152 million , respectively.

The  Company  also  recognizes  revenue  when  it  is  probable  that  future  recovery  of  previously  incurred  costs  or  future  refunds  that  are  to  be  credited  to

customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Homeowner  Services  Group  is  generated  through  various  protection  programs  in  which  the  Company  provides  fixed  fee
services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and external water and sewer lines, interior electric
and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts have a one-year term and each
service  is  a  separate  performance  obligation,  satisfied  over  time,  as  the  customers  simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  from  the  service.
Customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for
these services. Advances from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities with the U.S. government on various military
bases and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, as well as shorter-term contracts that provide customized water transfer services for shale natural
gas companies and customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously
receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.  Additionally,  these  contracts  allow  the  Company  to  make  capital  improvements  to  underlying
infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for
each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based
on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and
estimable.  Revenues  recognized  during  the  period  in  excess  of  billings  on  construction  contracts  are  recorded  as  unbilled  revenues,  with  billings  in  excess  of
revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may
result in revisions to costs and revenues, and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue for our Market-Based Businesses as
of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $42 million and $60 million , respectively.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken,

as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.

In  accordance  with  applicable  authoritative  guidance,  we  account  for  uncertain  income  tax  positions  using  a  benefit  recognition  model  with  a  two-step
approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no
benefit  is  recorded.  Uncertain  tax  positions  that  relate  only  to  timing  of  when  an  item  is  included  on  a  tax  return  are  considered  to  have  met  the  recognition
threshold.  Management  evaluates  each  position  based  solely  on  the  technical  merits  and  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  position,  assuming  the  position  will  be
examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold
has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

72

Table of Contents

We  evaluate  the  probability  of  realizing  deferred  tax  assets  quarterly  by  reviewing  a  forecast  of  future  taxable  income  and  our  intent  and  ability  to
implement  tax planning  strategies,  if necessary,  to realize  deferred  tax  assets.  We  also assess our ability  to utilize  tax attributes,  including  those in the form  of
carryforwards,  for  which  the  benefits  have  already  been  reflected  in  the  financial  statements.  We  record  valuation  allowances  for  deferred  tax  assets  when  we
conclude it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.

Under  GAAP,  specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740,  Income
Taxes
 (“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  be
recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to
apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured based
upon the new tax rate. For our regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to
refund to customers. For our unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.

The staff of the SEC has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law, more specifically the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017,
issued guidance in SAB 118 which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a
one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. SAB 118 describes three scenarios or buckets associated with a company’s status of
accounting for the TCJA: (i) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform; (ii) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate
for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount; or (iii) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore
continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted. The significant assumptions
considered and evaluated by the Company relating to accounting for the TCJA, include, but are not limited to, the:

•

•

•

•

recording of regulatory liabilities from the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred income taxes, and the uncertainty of regulatory treatment in
various jurisdictions in which the Company currently operates;

allocation to our subsidiaries of interest deductibility at the parent;

bonus depreciation deductions for assets constructed and placed in service during the period from September 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017;
and

normalization periods for our re-measured deferred taxes.

Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted
financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our
Regulated Businesses , as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could
result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 14—Income Taxes in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.

Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. See Note 15
—Employee Benefits in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information  regarding  the  description  of  and  accounting  for  the  defined
benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.

The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided
by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and
postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to
represent  the  average  expected  experience  over  time  and  may  differ  in  any  one  year  from  actual  experience  due  to  changes  in  capital  markets  and  the  overall
economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions
are:

•

•

•

Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made
in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of
high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

Expected  Return  on  Plan  Assets  (“EROA”)—Management  projects  the  future  return  on  plan  assets  considering  prior  performance,  but  primarily
based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit
costs we record currently.

Rate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  at
retirement.

73

Table of Contents

•

•

Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

Mortality—Management retained the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality base table, which provides rates of mortality in 2006, but adopted the
new MP-2018 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2006.

The discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent
with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. We use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored
to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the
discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 4.38% , 3.75% and 4.28% at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The discount
rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 4.32% , 3.73% and 4.26% at December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

In selecting an EROA, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The long-

term EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 5.95% for 2018 , 6.49% for 2017 , and 7.02% for 2016 . The weighted average EROA assumption
used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 4.77% for 2018 , 5.09% for 2017 and 5.37% for 2016 .

During 2017, the Company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60% to 50%, and increasing its
long duration fixed-income allocation from 40% to 50%. This structure is designed to reduce the plan’s funded status volatility. It is also intended to reduce the
pension  plan’s  exposure  to  interest  rates  since  a  higher  proportion  of  long  duration  fixed-income  securities  that  have  a  duration  similar  to  that  of  the  pension
liabilities should reduce interest rate risk associated with the plan’s liabilities.

Postretirement
Medical
Bargaining
Plan
Changes

On July 31, 2018 , a new, five -year national benefits agreement was ratified, covering approximately 3,200 of our union-represented employees. Most of
the benefits under this new agreement will become effective on January 1, 2019, and include, among other things, union-represented employees’ participation in
the Company’s cash-based annual performance plan, additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits, which required the Company
to remeasure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018.

For those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65, the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a Health Reimbursement
Arrangement (“HRA”) similar to the cap currently in place for non-union retirees. The Company is providing a subsidy allowing the post-65 retirees to purchase a
Medicare supplemental plan on a private exchange network. The pre-65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed to
limit the employer costs to 2018 levels. For pre-65 union members retiring early in 2019-2021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of the
cap.

On  August 31, 2018 , the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect this plan change. The plan change resulted in a  $175 million
reduction  in  future  benefits  payable  to  plan  participants,  and,  in  combination  with  other  experience  reflected  as  of  the  remeasurement  date,  resulted  in  a    $227
million  reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over   10.2 years, the average future working
lifetime to full eligibility age for all plan participants.

After the remeasurement, the Retirement and Benefit Plans Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing the
investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, determined that the funded status of the Postretirement Medical Bargaining
Plan was in excess of that needed to pay current and future benefits.

74

Table of Contents

Given  the  change  in  funded  status,  the  Investment  Committee  commissioned  a  new  asset-liability  study  for  the  Postretirement  Medical  Bargaining  Plan.
This study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the risk in the plan and to remove its equity exposure. The study also recommended reducing its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates  by  matching  the  assets  of  the  plan  to  the  projected  cash  flows  for  future  benefit  payments  of  the  liability.  The  Investment  Committee
agreed with the recommendations and approved the investment of the Postretirement Medical Bargaining Plan assets in fixed-income securities.

The restructuring of the plan was initiated toward year-end. Once fully completed, the plan’s assets will be invested in fixed-income securities. The majority
of the securities will be used to match the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. Plan assets in excess of those securities designed to
match the long-term liabilities will be invested in shorter duration securities with a duration of about three years.

American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.

The investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds.
The  trustee  for  the  Company’s  defined  benefit  pension  and  postretirement  welfare  plans  uses  an  independent  valuation  firm  to  calculate  the  fair  value  of  plan
assets.  Additionally,  the  Company independently  verifies  the  assets’  values.  Approximately  88% of the assets  are  valued  using the quoted market  price for the
assets in an active market at the measurement date, while 12% of the assets are valued using other inputs.

In selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. Our rate of compensation increase was

3% for 2018 , 3.02% for 2017 and 3.07% for 2016 .

In selecting health care cost trend rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2017, our health care
cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7% in 2018 gradually declining to 4.5% in 2026 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2018 , the
Company is projecting that medical inflation will be 6.75% in 2019 and, it will ultimately trend down to 5%, but not until 2026.

We will use a discount rate and EROA of 4.38% and 6.2% , respectively, for estimating our 2019 pension costs. Additionally, we will use a discount rate
and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 4.32% and 3.56% , respectively, for estimating our 2019 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in
the discount rate or the EROA would increase our pension expense. Our 2018 and 2017 pension and postretirement benefit costs were $21 million and $56 million
, respectively. The Company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to $31 million in 2019 , and $32 million , $29
million , $29 million and $29 million in 2020 , 2021 , 2022 and 2023 , respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.
The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded
pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. As these assumptions change
from period to period, recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change.

Accounting for Contingencies

We record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a
range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome
of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or
estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limed to: the nature of the
litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or
situations. We provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be
incurred. We provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable
range.

75

Table of Contents

Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the
liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We  are  exposed  to  market  risk  associated  with  changes  in  commodity  prices,  equity  prices  and  interest  rates.  We  are  exposed  to  risks  from  changes  in
interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate
exposure  and  by monitoring  the  effects  of market  changes  in interest  rates.  We also  have  the ability  to enter  into  financial  derivative  instruments,  which could
include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate
interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2018 , a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with our short-term borrowings would result in a
$10 million increase in short-term interest expense.

As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $360 million to reduce interest
rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. The forward starting swap agreements terminate in 2019 and have an average fixed rate of 3.16% . When
entering  into  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps, the  Company is subject  to market  risk  with respect  to  changes  in the  underlying  benchmark  interest  rate  that
impacts the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps. We manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected
debt issuance. The fair value of the forward starting swaps at December 31, 2018 was in a loss position  of $14 million . A hypothetical 1% adverse change in
interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward starting swaps of approximately $66 million at December 31, 2018 .

On January  8,  2019  ,  we  entered  into  an  additional  forward  starting  swap  agreement,  with  a  notional  amount  of    $150  million  ,  to  reduce  interest  rate

exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in December 2019 , and has an average fixed rate of  2.76% .

Our risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected
ability  to  recover  price  increases  through  rates,  in  the  next  general  rate  case  proceeding  or  other  regulatory  mechanism,  as  authorized  by  each  regulatory
jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to our operating performance. In particular, our stock price
may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among other
things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility
may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock, regardless of our financial performance,
and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.

We  are  exposed  to  credit  risk  through  our  water,  wastewater  and  other  water-related  services  provided  by  our  Regulated  Businesses  and Market-Based
Businesses  .  Our  Regulated  Businesses  serve  residential,  commercial,  industrial  and  other  customers  while  our  Market-Based  Businesses  engage  in  business
activities  with  developers,  government  entities  and  other  customers.  Our  primary  credit  risk  is  exposure  to  customer  default  on  contractual  obligations  and  the
associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. Our credit risk is managed through established credit and
collection  policies  which  are  in  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  involve  monitoring  of  customer  exposure  and  the  use  of  credit  risk
mitigation  measures  such  as  letters  of  credit  or  prepayment  arrangements.  Our  credit  portfolio  is  diversified  with  no  significant  customer  or  industry
concentrations.  In  addition,  our  Regulated  Businesses  are  generally  able  to  recover  all  prudently  incurred  costs  including  uncollectible  customer  accounts
receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.

The Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact
the  Company’s  pension  and  other  benefits  expense,  funded  status  and  future  minimum  funding  requirements.  Changes  in  interest  rates  can  impact  retirement
liabilities. We aim to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of our
pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, we expect that the
fixed-income assets in our retirement trust will also increase in value. We also expect our risk to be reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit
costs through rates.

76

Table of Contents

We are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. The credit
quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and
other  market  changes.  In  addition,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  regulators  will  grant  sufficient  rate  authorizations.  Therefore,  our  ability  to  fully  recover
operating expense, recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
American Water Works Company, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”)  as  of
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We
also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal
Control
-
Integrated
Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal
Control
-
Integrated
Framework
(2013) issued by the
COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Pivotal Home Solutions from its assessment
of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2018. We
have also excluded Pivotal Home Solutions from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Pivotal Home Solutions is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose
total  assets  and  total  revenues  excluded  from  management’s  assessment  and  our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  represent  less  than  1% and
approximately 2% , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unless otherwise noted, in millions, except per share data)

Note 1: Organization and Operation

American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  a  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiaries
throughout  the  United  States  and  Ontario,  Canada.  The  Company’s  primary  business  involves  the  ownership  of  regulated  utilities  that  provide  water  and
wastewater services in 16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the “ Regulated Businesses .” The Company also operates market-based businesses
that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the “
Market-Based  Businesses  .”  The  Company’s  primary  Market-Based  Businesses  include  the  Homeowner  Services  Group  ,  which  provides  warranty  protection
programs to residential and smaller commercial customers; the Military Services Group , which provides water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on
military installations; and Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC, which provides water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies.

Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is
maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company uses the equity method to report its investments in joint ventures where
it holds up to a 50% voting interest and cannot exercise control over the operations and policies of the investments. Under the equity method, the Company records
its interests as an investment and its percentage share of the investee’s earnings as income or losses.

In  July  2015,  the  Company  acquired  a  95%  interest  in  Water  Solutions  Holdings,  LLC,  including  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Keystone  Clearwater
Solutions, LLC (collectively  referred  to  as “Keystone”).  During  the fourth  quarter  of 2018, pursuant  to the exercise  of put options  by the minority  owners, the
Company acquired  the remaining 5% interest  in  Keystone,  bringing  its  ownership  interest  to    100% .  The  former  minority  owners’  interest  was  recognized  as
redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  and  was  included  in  Other  long-term  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  There  was  no  remaining  redeemable
noncontrolling interest as of December 31, 2018 , and $7 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 31, 2017 .

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  (“GAAP”)  requires  that
management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results
could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory
accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill and
long-lived assets, including regulatory assets, (iii) revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iv) accounting for income
taxes  and  the  enacted  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (the  “TCJA”),  (v)  benefit  plan  assumptions  and  (vi)  the  estimates  and  judgments  used  in  determining  loss
contingencies. The Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and
liabilities, goodwill, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.

Regulation

The  Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  generally  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  certain  state  utility  commissions  or  other  entities  engaged  in  utility
regulation,  collectively  referred  to as Public Utility  Commissions  (“PUCs” or “Regulators”).  As such, the Company follows authoritative  accounting  principles
required  for  rate  regulated  utilities,  which  requires  the  effects  of  rate  regulation  to  be  reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  PUCs
generally authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may
also approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes,
affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,  reorganizations,  mergers,  and  acquisitions,  along  with  imposing  certain  penalties  or  granting  certain  incentives.  Due  to
timing  and  other  differences  in  the  collection  of  a  regulated  utility’s  revenues,  these  authoritative  accounting  principles  allow  a  cost  that  would  otherwise  be
charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely,
these principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts
collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information.

87

Table of Contents

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of
retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and
supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to
O&M expense as incurred.

The cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in
conformity  with  amounts  approved  by  PUCs, after  regulatory  review  of  the  information  the  Company  submits  to  support  its  estimates  of  the  assets’  remaining
useful lives.

Nonutility  property  consists  primarily  of  buildings  and  equipment  utilized  by  the  Company’s  Market-Based Businesses and for internal  operations.  This

property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.

When units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated
depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset
is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These
amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are
incurred.

The costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these

costs amounted to $336 million and $346 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds

Substantially  all  cash  is  invested  in  interest-bearing  accounts.  All  highly  liquid  investments  with  a  maturity  of  three  months  or  less  when purchased  are

considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted funds consists primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services
under O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.

The  following  table  provides  a  reconciliation  of  the  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  Restricted  funds  amounts  as  presented  on  the  Consolidated  Balance

Sheets, to the sum of such amounts presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31 :

Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues

Accounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on
a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based trade
accounts receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not
been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

Allowances  for  uncollectible  accounts  are  maintained  for  estimated  probable  losses  resulting  from  the  Company’s  inability  to  collect  receivables  from
customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance
for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company generally writes off accounts when they
become uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding. See Note 6—Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.

88

Table of Contents

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a
business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for
impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying value.

The Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)
the acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to the Company’s previous owner in 2001, (iii) the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”) in
2018, and (iv) the acquisition of Keystone in 2015; and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of
testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based Businesses
is comprised of the Homeowner Services Group reporting unit, the Military Services Group reporting unit and the Keystone reporting unit.

The  Company’s  annual  impairment  testing  is  performed  as  of  November 30 of  each  year,  in  conjunction  with  the  completion  of  the  Company’s  annual
business plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors,
that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the
qualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its
carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective
net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s
carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of
reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions
used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates, capital expenditures, tax rates,
working capital, weighted average cost of capital and projected terminal values.

The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the
assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note
8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.

Intangible Assets

Intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  finite-lived  customer  relationships  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Pivotal  and  Keystone.  Finite-lived  intangible
assets are initially measured at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits
of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets
for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fair
value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimated
value  fair  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset.  An  impairment  loss  will  be  recognized  in  the  amount  equal  to  the  excess  of  the  long-lived  asset’s  carrying  value
compared to its estimated fair value.

The long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide
operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in
rates of that asset is no longer probable.

89

Table of Contents

The Company holds other long-term investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, and are classified as
other Long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of the long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and
solvency of the entities in which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. If such long-term investments are considered impaired,
an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.

The  Company  believes  the  assumptions  and  other  considerations  used  to  value  long-lived  assets  to  be  appropriate,  however,  if  actual  experience  differs
from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction

Regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estate

developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.

Advances are refundable  for limited  periods of time  as new customers  begin to receive  service  or other contractual  obligations  are  fulfilled.  Included  in
Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $23 million , respectively.
Those amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.

Advances  that  are  no  longer  refundable  are  reclassified  to  contributions.  Contributions  are  permanent  collections  of  plant  assets  or  cash  for  a  particular
construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-
investor supplied funds.

Generally,  the  Company depreciates  utility  plant  funded by contributions  and amortizes  its contributions  balance  as a reduction  to depreciation  expense,
producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory
guidelines,  some  of  the  Company’s  utility  subsidiaries  do  not  amortize  contributions,  and  any  contribution  received  remains  on  the  balance  sheet  indefinitely.
Amortization  of  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was  $28 million , $27 million and $27 million for the years ended December  31, 2018  , 2017 and 2016 ,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

On  January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606,  Revenue
From
Contracts
With
Customers,
 and  all  related
amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”) ,
using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under
this approach, periods prior to the adoption date have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Under ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a
customer.  Revenue  is  recognized  when  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the  customer  obtains  control  of  promised  goods  or  services.  The  amount  of
revenue  recognized  reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Company  expects  to  be  entitled  to  receive  in  exchange  for  goods  or  services.  Under  ASC  606,  a
contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines
are  within  the  scope  of  ASC  606,  the  Company  performs  the  following  five  steps:  (i)  identifies  the  contracts  with  a  customer;  (ii)  identifies  the  performance
obligations  within  the  contract,  including  whether  any  performance  obligations  are  distinct  and  capable  of  being  distinct  in  the  context  of  the  contract;  (iii)
determines  the transaction  price;  (iv)  allocates  the  transaction  price  to the  performance  obligations  in the  contract;  and  (v) recognizes  revenue  when, or as,  the
Company satisfies each performance obligation.

The Company’s revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billing
and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component
practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.

Table of Contents

Regulated
Businesses
Revenue

Revenue  from  the  Company’s  Regulated  Businesses  is  generated  primarily  from  water  and  wastewater  services  delivered  to  customers.  These  contracts
contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately
identifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  are
generally  no  significant  financing  components  or  variable  consideration.  Revenues  include  amounts  billed  to  customers  on  a  cycle  basis  and  unbilled  amounts
calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts
that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value
transferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to
be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.

Market-Based
Businesses
Revenue

Through various warranty protection programs, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect against
repair costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as
well  as  power  surge  protection  and  other  related  services.  Most  of  the  contracts  have  a  one-year  term  and  each  service  is  a  separate  performance  obligation,
satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service. Customers are obligated to pay for the protection
programs  ratably  over  12 months  or  via  a  one-time,  annual  fee,  with  revenues  recognized  ratably  over  time  for  these  services.  Advances  from  customers  are
deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military
installations and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers, as well as shorter-term contracts that provide customized water transfer services for shale
natural  gas  companies  and  customers.  Billing  and  revenue  recognition  for  the  fixed  fee  revenues  occurs  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract,  as  customers
simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to
underlying  infrastructure,  which  are  initiated  through  separate  modifications  or  amendments  to  the  original  contract,  whereby  stand-alone,  fixed  pricing  is
separately  stated  for  each  improvement.  The  Company  has  determined  that  these  capital  improvements  are  separate  performance  obligations,  with  revenue
recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses
first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with
billings  in  excess  of  revenues  recorded  as  other  current  liabilities  until  the  recognition  criteria  are  met.  Changes  in  contract  performance  and  related  estimated
contract  profitability  may  result  in  revisions  to  costs  and  revenues,  and  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  revisions  are  determined.  See  Note 3—Revenue
Recognition for additional information.

Income Taxes

The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  participate  in  a  consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  for  U.S.  tax  purposes.  Members  of  the  consolidated  group  are

charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.

Certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company
provides  deferred  income  taxes  on  the  difference  between  the  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  amounts  at  which  they  are  carried  in  the  financial
statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In
addition,  the  regulated  utility  subsidiaries  recognize  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  effect  on  revenues  expected  to  be  realized  as  the  tax  effects  of
temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.

Investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of

the related assets.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected

from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds
devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to
borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of Interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would
be included in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. AFUDC is provided in the following table for the years ended  December 31 :

Environmental Costs

The  Company’s  water  and  wastewater  operations  and  the  operations  of  its  Market-Based Businesses are  subject  to  U.S.  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign
requirements  relating  to  environmental  protection,  and  as  such,  the  Company  periodically  becomes  subject  to  environmental  claims  in  the  normal  course  of
business. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be
reasonably estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010
and amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel
River watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1 million annually commencing in 2010 with the final payment being made in 2021.
Remediation costs accrued amounted to $4 million and $6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered
into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into
derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.

All  derivatives  are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  On  the  date  the  derivative  contract  is  entered  into,  the  Company  may  designate  the
derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to
be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gains
and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11

—Long-Term Debt for additional information.

New Accounting Standards

The following accounting standards were adopted by the Company in 2018 :

Description

Changes the criteria for recognizing revenue from a contract with a
customer. Replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition,
including most industry-specific guidance. The objective is to provide
a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers to improve comparability within industries, across
industries and across capital markets. The underlying principle is that
an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and
services to customers at an amount the entity expects to be entitled to
in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires a
number of disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flows.
Updated the accounting guidance to clarify the definition of a
business, with the objective of assisting entities with evaluating
whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions, or
disposals, of assets or businesses.
Updated authoritative guidance to require the service cost component
of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income
statement line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising
from services rendered during the period. The remaining components
of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately
from the service cost component, in an income statement line item
outside of operating income. Also, the guidance only allows for the
service cost component to be eligible for capitalization. The updated
guidance does not impact the accounting for net periodic benefit costs
as regulatory assets or liabilities.

Updated authoritative guidance to simplify the subsequent
measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill
impairment test. Under the amendments in the update, an entity should
perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing
the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An
impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the
loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. An entity still has the option to
perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if
the quantitative impairment test is necessary.
Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for cloud computing
arrangements that are service contracts. Under this guidance,
implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements and
in developing or obtaining internal-use software follow the same
capitalization requirements. The accounting for the service element of
the arrangement remains unchanged.
Updated the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans. The
guidance removes the requirement to disclose the amounts in
accumulated other comprehensive income to be recognized as net
periodic benefit cost, the effects of a one percent change in assumed
healthcare costs and a number of other disclosures. The guidance
clarifies that projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit
obligations should be disclosed, and adds disclosure requirements for
the weighted average interest crediting rates for promised interest
crediting rates and an explanation of the reasons for significant gains
and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation.
Permits an entity to reclassify tax effects in accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as a result of the TCJA, to retained
earnings.

Table of Contents

The following recently issued accounting standards have not yet been adopted by the Company as of December 31, 2018 :

Description

Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for leasing
arrangements. Under this guidance, a lessee will be required to
recognize the following for all leases, excluding short-term leases, at
the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that
represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. Under the guidance, lessor accounting is
largely unchanged. A package of optional transition practical
expedients allows an entity not to reassess under the new guidance (i)
whether any existing contracts are or contain leases (ii) lease
classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Additional optional
transition practical expedients are available which allow an entity not
to evaluate existing land easements if the easements were not
previously accounted for as leases, and to apply the new lease
standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect
adjustment in the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of
adoption.

Updated the accounting and disclosure guidance for hedging activities,
which allows for more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies to
be eligible for hedge accounting. Under this guidance, a qualitative
effectiveness assessment is permitted for certain hedges if an entity
can reasonably support an expectation of high effectiveness
throughout the term of the hedge, provided that an initial quantitative
test establishes that the hedge relationship is highly effective. Also, for
cash flow hedges determined to be highly effective, all changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recorded in other
comprehensive income, with a subsequent reclassification to earnings
when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Designates the OIS rate based on SOFR as an eligible U.S. benchmark
interest rate for the purposes of applying hedge accounting.

Estimated Effect on the Consolidated
Financial Statements

The adoption will result in recording operating
lease right-of-use assets of approximately $118
million and operating lease liabilities of
approximately $116 million on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The immaterial difference
between the operating lease right-of-use assets
and operating lease liabilities will be recorded as
an adjustment to retained earnings. The
Company has defined a process and
implemented internal controls and software to
meet the accounting and reporting requirements
of the guidance and did not elect early adoption
for the standard. The Company will elect all
practical expedients available under the new
lease accounting and disclosure guidance. The
practical expedient related to land easements
allowed the Company to carry forward
accounting treatment for existing land
easements, which is to record easements as land
and land rights in utility plant.

The adoption will not have a material impact on
the Consolidated Financial Statements based
upon the Company’s hedging activities as of the
most recent balance sheet date.

Prospective

January 1,
2019; early

Updated the accounting guidance on reporting credit losses for
financial assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt
securities. Under this guidance, expected credit losses are required to
be measured based on historical experience, current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of
the reported amount of financial assets. Also, this guidance requires
that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as
an allowance rather than as a direct write-down.
Updated the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The
guidance removes the requirements to disclose transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, the timing of transfers between
levels, and the valuation processes for Level 3 measurements.
Disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 measurements will be
required. The guidance adds disclosure requirements for the change in
unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for
recurring Level 3 measurements, as well as the range and weighted
average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3
measurements.

Contract Balances

Contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  are  the  result  of  timing  differences  between  revenue  recognition,  billings  and  cash  collections.  In  the  Company’s
Market-Based Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon
achievement  of  contractual  milestones.  Contract  assets  are  recorded  when  billing  occurs  subsequent  to  revenue  recognition,  and  are  reclassified  to  accounts
receivable  when  billed  and  the  right  to  consideration  becomes  unconditional.  Contract  liabilities  are  recorded  when  the  Company  receives  advances  from
customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts and home warranty protection program contracts, and are
recognized  as  revenue  when  the  associated  performance  obligations  are  satisfied.  Contract  assets  are  included  in  Unbilled  revenues  and  contract  liabilities  are
included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 .

Remaining performance obligations (“RPOs”) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The
Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and other customers.
As of December 31, 2018 , the Company’s operation and maintenance and capital improvement contracts in the Market-Based Businesses have RPOs. Contracts
with the U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2069 and have RPOs of $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 , as
measured  by  estimated  remaining  contract  revenue.  Such  contracts  are  subject  to  customary  termination  provisions  held  by  the  U.S.  government,  prior  to  the
agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities  and commercial customers expire between 2019 and 2038 and have RPOs of $596 million as of
December 31, 2018 , as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s,
the federal  government’s  or  other  party’s  water  or wastewater  treatment  and  delivery  facilities  include  responsibility  for certain  maintenance  for some of those
facilities,  in  exchange  for  an  annual  fee.  Unless  specifically  required  to  perform  certain  maintenance  activities,  the  maintenance  costs  are  recognized  when  the
maintenance is performed. Approximately $61 million of RPOs were eliminated in conjunction with the sale of 20 of the Contract Services Group ’s contracts to
subsidiaries of Veolia Environnement S.A. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion of this transaction.

Regulated Businesses

Acquisitions

During  2018,  the  Company  closed  on  15 various  regulated  water  and  wastewater  systems  for  a  total  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $33  million  . Assets
acquired in these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $32 million . Liabilities assumed, primarily contributions in aid of construction, totaled $1 million .
The Company recorded additional goodwill of $2 million associated with one of its acquisitions, which is reported in its Regulated Businesses segment. Of this
total goodwill, none is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions will be finalized once the
valuation of assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their acquisition date.

During 2017, the Company closed on 18 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $210 million
.  This  included  the  acquisition  of  the  wastewater  system  assets  of  the  Municipal  Authority  of  the  City  of  McKeesport,  Pennsylvania,  on  December  18, 2017  .
Assets acquired, principally utility plant, totaled $207 million . Liabilities assumed totaled $23 million , including $9 million of contributions in aid of construction
and  assumed  debt  of  $7  million  .  The  Company  recorded  additional  goodwill  of  $29  million  associated  with  four of  its  acquisitions,  which  is  reported  in  its
Regulated  Businesses  segment.  Of  this  total  goodwill,  approximately  $1  million  is  expected  to  be  deductible  for  tax  purposes.  Additionally,  the  Company
recognized a bargain purchase gain of  $3 million  associated with three of the acquisitions.

During 2016, the Company closed on 15 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $199 million
. This included the acquisition of substantially all of the wastewater collection and treatment assets of the Sewer Authority of the City of Scranton, Pennsylvania
(“Scranton”) in December 2016. Assets acquired, principally utility plant, totaled $194 million . Liabilities assumed totaled $30 million , including $14 million of
contributions in aid of construction and assumed debt of $6 million . During 2017 , the Company recorded additional goodwill of $43 million associated with five
of its acquisitions, which is reported in its Regulated Businesses segment. Of this total goodwill, approximately $31 million is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. Additionally, during 2018 the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of $5 million , increasing the goodwill recognized from the Scranton
acquisition.

Highlighted
Pending
Acquisitions

On April  13,  2018  ,  the  Company’s  Illinois  subsidiary  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  City  of  Alton,  Illinois’  regional  wastewater  system  for
approximately  $54  million  .  This  system  currently  serves  approximately  23,000  customers,  comprised  of  approximately  11,000  customers  in  Alton  and  an
additional 12,000 customers under bulk contracts in the nearby communities of Bethalto and Godfrey. In connection with the execution of the purchase agreement,
the Company’s Illinois subsidiary made a $5 million non-escrowed deposit to the seller during January 2019. The Company expects to close this acquisition during
the second quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approval.

On May 30, 2018 , the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of Exeter Township, Pennsylvania,
for approximately $96 million . This system currently serves approximately 9,000 customers and the Company expects to close this acquisition during the third
quarter of 2019, pending regulatory approval.

Market-Based Businesses

Pivotal
Acquisition

On June 4, 2018 , the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary American Water Enterprises, LLC, completed the acquisition of Pivotal for a total
purchase price of $365 million , net of cash received and including $9 million in working capital. Pivotal is headquartered in Naperville, Illinois, and is a provider
of home warranty protection products and services, operating in 18 states, with approximately 1.2 million customer contracts at the time of acquisition. Pivotal is
complementary to the Company’s Homeowner Services Group product offerings, and enhances its presence in the home warranty solutions markets through utility
partnerships. The results of Pivotal have been consolidated into the Homeowner Services Group non-reportable operating segment.

This acquisition was funded through the issuance of common stock, as described below, and from borrowings through the Company’s commercial paper
program, which were subsequently refinanced with the issuance of long-term debt during the third quarter of 2018. This acquisition is being accounted for as a
business combination which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The measurement period adjustments for Pivotal were complete as of December 31, 2018.

Goodwill  was  calculated  as  the  excess  of  the  consideration  transferred  over  the  net  assets  recognized,  and  represents  the  expected  revenue  and  cost
synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce of Pivotal. The goodwill is included in the Company’s Homeowner Services Group reporting unit,
within the  Market-Based Businesses , and is deductible for income tax purposes.

Customer relationships, which comprise the majority of the intangible assets balance, are amortized based on historical attrition rates over their estimated
useful lives of up to 21 years , with a weighted average life of approximately six years , as the assets are expected to contribute to the cash flows of the Company.
The remaining intangible assets are amortized over their expected benefit periods of up to six years , with a weighted average life of approximately three years .

Issuance

On April 11, 2018 , the Company effected an equity forward transaction by entering into a forward sale agreement with each of two forward purchasers in
connection with a public offering of 2,320,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In the equity forward transaction, the forward purchasers, or an affiliate,
borrowed an aggregate of 2,320,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from third parties and sold them to the underwriters in the public offering. On June 7,
2018 , the Company elected to fully and physically settle both forward sale agreements, resulting in the issuance of a total of 2,320,000 shares of its common stock
at a price of $79.01 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $183 million . The net proceeds of the transaction were used to finance a portion of the purchase price
of the Pivotal acquisition described above.

On July 5, 2018 , the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of the majority of the O&M contracts in its Contract Services Group to subsidiaries of
Veolia Environnement S.A. for $27 million . The Company closed on the sale of 20 of the 22 contracts associated with this agreement during the third quarter of
2018, and expects to close on the remaining two contracts, subject to customer consents, during the first half of 2019. As part of the sale, the Company recognized
a pre-tax gain of $14 million during the third quarter of 2018.

Note 7: Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

Regulatory Assets

Regulatory  assets  represent  costs  that  are  probable  of  recovery  from  customers  in  future  rates.  The  majority  of  the  regulatory  assets  earn  a  return.  The

following table provides the composition of regulatory assets as of December 31 :

The Company’s deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $352
million and $270 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the
pension plans which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.

Removal costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.

Regulatory  balancing  accounts  accumulate  differences  between  revenues  recognized  and  authorized  revenue  requirements  until  they  are  collected  from

customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.

San Clemente Dam project costs represent costs incurred and deferred by the Company’s utility subsidiary in California pursuant to its efforts to investigate
alternatives and remove the dam due to potential earthquake and flood safety concerns. In June 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) issued
a decision authorizing implementation of a project to reroute the Carmel River and remove the San Clemente Dam. The project includes the Company’s utility
subsidiary in California, the California State Conservancy and the National Marine Fisheries Services. Under the order’s terms, the CPUC has authorized recovery
for pre-construction costs, interim dam safety measures and environmental costs and construction costs. The authorized costs were being recovered via a surcharge
over a twenty -year period which began in October 2012. The unrecovered balance of project costs incurred, including cost of capital, net of surcharges totaled $85
million and $89 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Surcharges collected were $8 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017 , respectively. Pursuant to the general rate case approved in December 2018, approval was granted to reset the twenty -year amortization period to
begin January 1, 2018 and to establish an annual revenue requirement of $8 million to be recovered through base rates.

Debt expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt expense,

are deferred and amortized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates.

Purchase premium recoverable through rates is primarily the recovery of the acquisition premiums related to an asset acquisition by the Company’s utility
subsidiary in California during 2002, and acquisitions in 2007 by the Company’s utility subsidiary in New Jersey. As authorized for recovery by the California and
New Jersey PUCs, these costs are being amortized to depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations through November 2048.

Tank  painting  costs  are  generally  deferred  and  amortized  to  operations  and  maintenance  expense  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  on  a

straight-line basis over periods ranging from five to fifteen years, as authorized by the regulatory authorities in their determination of rates charged for service.

As a result of the prepayment by American Water Capital Corp., the Company’s wholly owned finance subsidiary (“AWCC”), of the 5.62% Series C Senior
Notes due upon maturity on December 21, 2018 (the “Series C Notes”), 5.62% Series E Senior Notes due March 29, 2019 (the “Series E Notes”) and 5.77% Series
F Senior Notes due December 21, 2022 (the “Series F Notes,” and together with the Series E Notes, the “Series Notes”), a make-whole premium of $10 million
was paid to the holders of the Series Notes on September 11, 2018. Substantially all of these early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Company’s
utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.

Other  regulatory  assets  include  certain  construction  costs  for  treatment  facilities,  property  tax  stabilization,  employee-related  costs,  deferred  other
postretirement benefit expense, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs among
others. These costs are deferred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.

Regulatory Liabilities

Regulatory liabilities  generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate-making process. Also, if
costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.

Income taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Company’s customers. On December 22, 2017 , the TCJA
was  signed  into  law,  which,  among  other  things,  enacted  significant  and  complex  changes  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  including  a  reduction  in  the
maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The TCJA created significant excess deferred income taxes that the
Company  and  its  regulatory  jurisdictions  believe  should  be  refunded  to  customers.  Since  these  are  significant  refundable  amounts,  the  Company  believes  it  is
probable these amounts will be refunded to customers through future rates, and as such the amounts have been recorded to a regulatory liability.

Removal costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful life that are recovered through customer rates
over  the  life  of  the  associated  assets.  In  December  2008,  the  Company’s  utility  subsidiary  in  New  Jersey,  at  the  direction  of  the  New  Jersey  Board  of  Public
Utilities, began to depreciate $48 million of the total balance into depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations via straight
line amortization through November 2048.

On  August 31, 2018 , the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain
union and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a  $227 million  reduction to the net accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation, with a corresponding regulatory liability. See Note 15—Employee Benefits  for additional information.

Pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  balancing  accounts  represent  the  difference  between  costs  incurred  and  costs  authorized  by  the  PUCs  that  are

expected to be refunded to customers.

During 2018, the Company’s 14 regulatory jurisdictions began to consider the impacts of the TCJA. The Company has adjusted customer rates to reflect the
lower income tax rate in 10 states. In one of those 10 states, a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets. In one additional state, the
Company  is  using  the  tax  savings  to  offset  additional  capital  investment  and  to  reduce  a  regulatory  asset.  Proceedings  in  the  other  three jurisdictions remain
pending. With respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes, regulators in the eight states that have considered the issue have agreed with the Company’s
overall timeline of passing the excess back to customers beginning no earlier than 2019, when the Company is able to produce the normalization schedule using the
average rate assumption method. In one of those states, the Company will use the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset future
infrastructure investments.

101

Table of Contents

The Company generally expects its regulated customers to benefit from the tax savings resulting from the TCJA. As a result, the Company has recorded a
$54 million reserve on revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 , for the estimated tax savings resulting from the TCJA, with a corresponding regulatory
liability,  of  which  the  current  portion  is  $18  million  and  is  recorded  in  other  current  liabilities,  and  the  long-term  portion  is  $36  million  and  is  recorded  in
regulatory liabilities. The Company cannot predict how each jurisdiction may calculate the amount of credits due to customers. If any of the Company’s regulatory
jurisdictions determines the credits due to customers are higher than the expected reduction to income tax expense, this would result in an adverse impact to the
Company’s results of operations and cash flows.

Other regulatory liabilities include legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.

In 2018, the Company acquired goodwill of  $247 million  associated with its acquisition of Pivotal, which was allocated to the Homeowner Services Group
reporting  unit, within the Market-Based Businesses .  Additionally,  the  Company  acquired  goodwill  of  $2 million associated with one of its acquisitions  in the
Regulated Businesses segment.

In  2017,  the  Company  recorded  aggregate  goodwill  of  $29  million  associated  with  four  of  its  acquisitions  in  the  Regulated  Businesses  segment.
Additionally, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of $5 million , increasing the goodwill recognized from the Scranton acquisition completed
in December 2016.

As a result of operational and financial challenges encountered in the construction business of Keystone, the Company substantially exited this business line
during  the  third  quarter  of  2018.  This  action,  along  with  the  exit  of  the  water  trucking  business  line  during  the  first  half  of  2018,  narrowed  the  scope  of  the
Keystone business going forward, focusing solely on providing water transfer services. Based on these factors, the Company concluded there were indicators that
the Keystone reporting unit may be impaired. Accordingly, impairment testing was performed as part of the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements during the third quarter of 2018.

In terms of the process followed, the Company first completed an impairment test of the Keystone reporting unit’s customer relationship intangible asset as
of September 30, 2018. The results of this impairment test showed the fair value of the intangible asset was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash,
pre-tax impairment charge of $4 million .

The Company then completed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Keystone reporting unit as of September 30, 2018. The results of this impairment
test showed the fair value of the Keystone reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $53 million . The
Company estimated the fair value of the Keystone reporting unit using an income approach valuation technique which estimates the amount and timing of future
discounted cash flows from operations of the Keystone reporting unit, relying on multiple projected scenarios. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair
value included, but was not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, including revenue and revenue growth, profit margins, and weighted average cost of
capital.

In aggregate, a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $57 million was recorded in Impairment charge on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
year ended December 31, 2018 , of which, $54 million was attributable to the Company, after adjustment for noncontrolling interest. See Note 18—Fair Value of
Financial Information for further information.

During  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  2017-04,  Simplifying
the
Test
for
Goodwill
Impairment.
 See  Note  2—Significant

Accounting Policies for additional information.

The Company completed  its annual  impairment  testing  of goodwill as of November 30 , 2018 , which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated
Businesses , Homeowner Services Group , Military Services Group and Keystone reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there
were no factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values and, as such, quantitative, fair
value-based testing was not necessary for these reporting units as of November 30 , 2018 .

There can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other
factors related to the performance of the Company’s reporting units. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stock
price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities and reporting unit companies, the lack of an increase in the Company’s
market price consistent with its peer companies, decreases in control premiums, or continued downward pressure on commodity prices. A decline in the forecasted
results  in  the  Company’s  business  plan,  such  as  changes  in  rate  case  results,  capital  investment  budgets  or  interest  rates,  could  also  result  in  an  impairment  of
goodwill. In regards to the Keystone reporting unit’s goodwill, adverse developments in market conditions, including prolonged depression of natural gas or oil
prices  or  other  factors  that  negatively  impact  the  Company’s  forecasted  operating  results,  cash  flows  or  key  assumptions,  could  result  in  an  impairment  of  a
portion, or all, of Keystone’s goodwill.

issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Company’s election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2018 , there were approximately 4.2 million shares available
for future issuance under the DRIP.

Anti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program

In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allowed the Company to purchase up to
10 million shares  of its outstanding common  stock over an unrestricted  period of time. The Company repurchased  0.6 million shares and 0.7 million shares of
common  stock  in  the  open  market  at  an  aggregate  cost  of  $45 million and $54 million under this program  for  the years  ended  December  31, 2018  and 2017 ,
respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , there were 5.5 million shares of common stock available for purchase under the program.

The Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to net
income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been capitalized as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included
in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 15—Employee Benefits for additional information.

The amortization of the loss on cash flow hedge is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the accompanying

Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, Reclassification

Dividends

The Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to having
access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Company’s subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from
the Company’s subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements, and
other factors. The Company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among
other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Company’s income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared,
they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the
distribution date. Since the dividends on the Company’s common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.

During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ,  the  Company  paid  $319  million  , $289  million  and $261  million  in  cash  dividends,  respectively.  The  following  table

Equity Forward Transaction

See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the forward sale agreements entered into by the Company on April 11, 2018 , and the

subsequent settlement of these agreements on June 7, 2018 .

Regulatory Restrictions

The issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), the Company’s wholly owned financing
subsidiary, does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUC authorization is
required to issue long-term debt at most of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries. The Company’s regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on
a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.

Under applicable law, the Company’s subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a
subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to American Water. Furthermore, the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay upstream
dividends  or  repay  indebtedness  to  American  Water  is  subject  to  compliance  with  applicable  regulatory  restrictions  and  financial  obligations,  including,  for
example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations, and other agreements or
covenants made or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries.

Note 10: Stock Based Compensation

The Company has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company
pursuant to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continued
employment with the Company (“RSUs”), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole
or in part of stated performance-based  goals (“PSUs”). The total aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2007 Plan is  15.5
million . As of December 31, 2018 , 7.5 million shares were available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus
Plan, as defined below, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the
terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.

In  May  2017,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  the  American  Water  Works  Company,  Inc.  2017  Omnibus  Equity  Compensation  Plan  (the  “2017
Omnibus Plan”). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and
employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of  7.2 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2018 ,
6.9 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following
forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.
Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or other stock-based awards.

The cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date
fair value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the three -year service
period. All awards granted in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vesting
period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is
compared to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The following table provides the stock-based compensation expense
recorded in operation and maintenance expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31 :

There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .

The Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock
units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company recognizes the tax benefits, which have been included in deferred income tax assets,
related  to  compensation  costs.  The  tax  deductions  in  excess  of  the  benefits  recorded  throughout  the  requisite  service  period  are  recorded  to  the  Consolidated
Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Stock Options

There were no grants of stock options to employees in 2018 and 2017 . In 2016 , the Company granted non-qualified stock options to certain employees
under the 2007 Plan. The stock options vest ratably over the three -year service period beginning on January 1 of the year of the grant and have no performance
vesting conditions. Expense is recognized using the straight-line method and is amortized over the requisite service period.

The  following  table  provides  the  weighted  average  assumptions  used  in  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  for  grants  and  the  resulting  weighted

The Company used the actual historical experience of exercises or expirations of the 2009 grant to determine the expected stock option life. The Company
began granting stock options at the time of its initial public offering in April 2008. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of historic volatilities of
traded  common  stock  of  peer  companies  (regulated  water  companies)  over  the  expected  term  of  the  stock  options  and  historic  volatilities  of  the  Company’s
common stock during the period it has been publicly traded. The dividend yield is based on the Company’s expected dividend payments and the stock price on the
date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury strips with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options. The exercise
price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options vest over periods ranging from one to
three years and have a maximum term of seven years from the effective date of the grant.

During  2018  ,  2017  and  2016  ,  the  Company  granted  RSUs  to  certain  employees  under  the  2007  Plan  and  2017  Omnibus  Plan,  as  applicable.  RSUs

generally vest based on continued employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years.

During 2018 and 2017 , the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan, and during 2016 , these awards were
granted under the 2007 Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier
of (i)  15 months after the grant date, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participant’s separation from service. Because these stock units
vested on the grant date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.

The RSUs are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over the
three -year  service  period  beginning  January  1  of  the  year  of  the  grant.  These  RSUs are  amortized  through  expense  over  the  requisite  service  period  using  the
straight-line method.

weighted average remaining life of 2.1 years. The total fair value of stock units and RSUs vested was $4 million , $3 million and $2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2007 Plan and 2017 Omnibus Plan, as applicable. The majority
of PSUs vest ratably based on continued employment with the Company over the three -year performance period beginning January 1 of the year of the grant (the
“Performance Period”). Distribution of the performance shares is contingent upon the achievement of one or more internal performance measures and, separately, a
relative total shareholder return performance measure, over the Performance Period.

weighted average remaining life of 1.35 years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was $12 million , $13 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31,
2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

PSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
date  of  grant.  PSUs  granted  with  a  relative  total  shareholder  return  condition  are  valued  using  a  Monte  Carlo  model.  Expected  volatility  is  based  on  historical
volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years. The expected term is three years
and the risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. The following table provides the weighted average

If dividends are paid with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock before the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, the Company credits a liability for
the value of the dividends that would have been paid if the RSUs and PSUs were shares of Company common stock. When the RSUs and PSUs are distributed, the
Company  pays  the  participant  a  lump  sum  cash  payment  equal  to  the  value  of  the  dividend  equivalents  accrued.  The  Company  accrued  dividend  equivalents
totaling $1 million , less than $1 million and $1 million to accumulated deficit in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity
for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) through which employee participants  may use payroll deductions to
acquire Company common stock at a discount. Prior to February 5, 2019, the purchase price of common stock acquired under the ESPP was the lesser of 90% of
the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning or the end of a three -month purchase period. On July 27, 2018, the ESPP was amended, effective
February  5,  2019,  to  permit  employee  participants  to  acquire  Company  common  stock  at  85% of  the  fair  market  value  of  the  common  stock  at  the  end  of  the
purchase  period.  As  of  December  31,  2018  ,  there  were  1.9  million  shares  of  common  stock  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  ESPP.  The  ESPP  is  considered
compensatory. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company issued 95 thousand , 93 thousand and 93 thousand shares, respectively,
under the ESPP.

collateralized as of December 31, 2018 .

Long-term  debt  indentures  contain  a  number  of  covenants  that,  among  other  things,  limit,  subject  to  certain  exceptions,  the  Company  from  issuing  debt
secured  by  the  Company’s  assets.  Certain  long-term  notes  require  the  Company  to  maintain  a  ratio  of  consolidated  total  indebtedness  to  consolidated  total
capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00 . The ratio as of December 31, 2018 was 0.59 to 1.00 . In addition, the Company has $889 million of notes which
include the right to redeem the notes at par value, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to certain restrictions.

On  August 9, 2018 , AWCC completed a  $1.325 billion  debt offering which included the sale of  $625 million  aggregate principal amount of its  3.75%
 Senior Notes due in 2028, and  $700 million  aggregate principal amount of its  4.20%  Senior Notes due in 2048. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received,
after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion . AWCC used proceeds from the
offering to (i) lend funds to American Water and its regulated operating subsidiaries, (ii) repay $191 million principal amount of AWCC’s Series C Notes upon
maturity on December 21, 2018, (iii) prepay $100 million aggregate principal amount of AWCC’s outstanding Series E Notes and $100 million aggregate principal
amount of AWCC’s outstanding Series F Notes, and (iv) repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes.

As a result of AWCC’s prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $10 million was paid to the holders thereof on September 11, 2018.
Substantially all of these early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Company’s utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company
believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.

Interest, net includes interest income of approximately $11 million , $14 million and $14 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

management  policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps.  The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by  managing
commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to
derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions having
long-term credit ratings of “A” or better.

On August 6, 2018 , the Company terminated four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  $400 million , realizing a net

gain of  $9 million , to be amortized through interest, net over 10 - and  30 -year periods, in correlation with the terms of the new debt issued on August 9, 2018 .

On August 17, 2018 , the Company entered into two forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $80 million , to reduce interest rate
exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in August 2019 , and have an average fixed rate of  2.98% . On
October 11, 2018 , the Company entered into two additional forward starting swap agreements, each with a notional amount of  $100 million , to reduce interest
rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. These forward starting swap agreements terminate in December 2019 , and have an average fixed rate of
3.31% . On January 8, 2019 , the Company entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement, with a notional amount of  $150 million , to reduce interest
rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019. This forward starting swap agreement terminates in December 2019 , and has an average fixed rate of  2.76% .
The Company has designated these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain
or loss. Upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the
term of the new debt.

The Company has employed interest rate swaps to fix the interest cost on a portion of its variable-rate debt with an aggregate notional amount of $3 million
.  The  Company  has  designated  these  instruments  as  economic  hedges,  accounted  for  at  fair  value,  with  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest,  net.  The  gain
recognized by the Company was de minimis for the years ended 2018 and 2017 .

Note 12: Short-Term Debt

Short-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $964 million and $905 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 ,
respectively. On March 21, 2018, AWCC increased the maximum aggregate principal amount of borrowings authorized for issuance under its commercial paper
program from $1.60 billion to $2.10 billion . The weighted average interest rate on AWCC short-term borrowings was approximately 2.28% and 1.24% for the
year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.

On March 21, 2018, AWCC and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility to increase the
maximum commitments under the facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion , and to extend the expiration date of the facility from June 2020 to March 2023. The
facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying
certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million , and to
request  extensions  of  its  expiration  date  for  up  to  two  one-year  periods.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  AWCC  had  no outstanding  borrowings  and  $81 million of
outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $2.17 billion available to fulfill the Company’s short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of
credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. The financial covenants
with  respect  to  the  facility  remained  unchanged  from  the  credit  agreement  in  effect  on  December  31,  2017.  Issuance  costs  related  to  the  increased  lending
commitments  will  be  amortized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  credit  facility  and  is  included  in  interest,  net  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of
Operations. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Service’s
and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services’ then applicable credit rating on AWCC’s senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.

The credit facility requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00 . The ratio as of

December 31, 2018 was 0.59 to 1.00 .

None of the Company’s borrowings  are subject  to default  or prepayment  as a result of a downgrading of securities,  although such a downgrading could

increase fees and interest charges under the Company’s credit facility.

As part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. These
contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  future  performance  when
there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency,
especially  if  such  downgrade  is  to  a  level  below  investment  grade,  it  is  possible  that  a  counterparty  would  attempt  to  rely  on  such  a  downgrade  as  a  basis  for
making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance.  Depending on the Company’s net position with the counterparty, the demand could be for the
posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested
will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing and
financially able to perform its obligations, it may be possible that no collateral would need to be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of
future payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

On December 22, 2017 , President Trump signed into law the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning
after  December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant  changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including amendments which significantly  change the
taxation  of  individuals  and  business  entities,  and  includes  specific  provisions  related  to  regulated  public  utilities.  The  more  significant  changes  that  impact  the
Company  included  in  the  TCJA  are  reductions  in  the  corporate  federal  income  tax  rate  from  35% to 21% ,  and  several  technical  provisions  including,  among
others, limiting the utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The
specific  provisions  related  to  regulated  public  utilities  in  the  TCJA  generally  allow  for  the  continued  deductibility  of  interest  expense,  the  elimination  of  full
expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continue certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation
benefits. Non-regulated segments of the Company’s business may be able to take advantage of the full expensing provisions of the TCJA.

Changes in the Code from the TCJA had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements in 2017. Under GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 740, Income
Taxes
(“ASC 740”), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740
also requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or
settled. Thus, at the date of enactment, the Company’s deferred income taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities,
substantially  all  of  the  change  in  deferred  income  taxes  are  recorded  as  either  an  offset  to  a  regulatory  asset  or  liability  because  changes  are  expected  to  be
recovered by or refunded to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as a non-cash re-measurement
adjustment to earnings.

The staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the TCJA, and on December 22, 2017
issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) which clarifies accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or
complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting. The Company made a reasonable estimate for the
measurement  and accounting  of certain  effects  of the TCJA which were  reflected  in the financial  statements  as of December  31, 2017. The re-measurement  of
deferred  income  taxes  at  the  new  federal  tax  rate  increased  the  2017  deferred  income  tax  provision  by  $125  million  for  the  year  ending  December  31,  2017.
Additionally,  the  accumulated  deferred  income  tax  liability  decreased  by  $1.39 billion and  regulatory  liabilities  increased  by  $1.51 billion ,  respectively,  as  of
December 31, 2017.

113

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2018 , the Company has recorded all its reasonable estimates resulting from the TCJA under SAB 118. These estimates, however, are
still subject to changes due to the future impacts of various items, including further changes in income tax laws, forecasted financial conditions and the actual tax
return filings with the tax authorities.

ASC 740 requires the re-measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income.
Adjusting  temporary  differences  originally  recorded  to  AOCI  through  the  income  statement  result  in  disproportionate  tax  effects  remaining  in  AOCI.  As  of
December 31, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02, Reclassification
of
Certain
Tax
Effects
from
Accumulated
Other
Comprehensive
Income,
which  allows  companies  to  reclassify  the  income  tax  effects  of  TCJA  on  items  within  AOCI  to  retained  earnings.  As  a  result  of  the  TCJA  tax  rate
reduction,  there  were  income  tax  effects  related  to  the  Company’s  hedge  and  pension  positions  of  $2  million  and $22  million  ,  respectively,  remaining  in  the
Company’s  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  balance.  The  Company  reclassified  these  tax  effects  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  to
accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 .

During 2018, the Company continued to assess the impacts of the TCJA and filed its 2017 federal and state income tax returns. As of December 31, 2018,
the Company completed its analysis of the estimated impact of TCJA on its federal and state income taxes based on information available to date, and recorded
adjustments to its provisional estimates under SAB 118 in the amount of $12 million . These estimates may be revised in the future for changes in income tax laws,
additional regulatory guidance, changes to forecasted financial conditions, and actual tax return filings with the tax authorities.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company recognized federal NOL carryforwards of $707 million and $1.05 billion , respectively. The Company
believes the federal NOL carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and require no valuation allowance. The Company’s federal NOL carryforwards
will begin to expire in 2028 .

As of December  31,  2018  and 2017 , the  Company  had  state  NOLs of  $547 million and $322 million ,  respectively,  a  portion  of  which  are  offset  by  a
valuation allowance because the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards began to expire in
2018 through 2037 .

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company had an insignificant amount of Canadian NOL carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards for federal

income tax purposes.

The  Company  files  income  tax  returns  in  the  United  States  federal  jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  With  few  exceptions,  the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company has
state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.

The Company’s tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The gross liability was reduced
primarily as a result of the Section 481(a) adjustment allocated for the current year related to the accounting method change the Company filed with its 2015 tax
return.  The  Company  does  not  anticipate  material  changes  to  its  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  next  year.  However,  the  Company  expects  to  utilize  a
significant portion of the remaining NOLs in 2019 and fully utilize its NOLs in 2020, as a result, a balance sheet reclassification between the unrecognized tax
benefits and deferred income tax asset is anticipated due to the lack of available NOLs to offset. If the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31,
2018  ,  an  unrecognized  tax  benefit  of  $10  million  ,  excluding  interest  and  penalties,  would  impact  the  Company’s  effective  tax  rate.  The  Company  had  an
insignificant amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations.
Benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension
plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups
specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired
on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2006  are  provided  with  a  5.25% of  base  pay  defined  contribution  plan.  The
Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental non-qualified pension plans that provide
additional retirement benefits to certain employees.

The Company’s pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional contributions if needed to avoid “at risk” status and benefit restrictions under the
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans’ funded
position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates
charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 7—Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information. Pension plan assets
are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts
with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).

The Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare
plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.
The Company’s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of
actively managed and commingled funds including equities and fixed income securities.

The investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a
long-term horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the
Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.

The  Company  uses  fair  value  for  all  classes  of  assets  in  the  calculation  of  market-related  value  of  plan  assets.  As  of  2017,  the  fair  values  and  asset
allocations of the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands Water
Company, Inc. Pension Plan.

The  following  tables  provide  the  fair  values  and  asset  allocations  of  the  pension  plan  assets  as  of  December  31, 2018  and 2017 ,  respectively,  by  asset

The Company’s postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk
mitigation  strategies  for  the  plans  are  tailored  specifically  for  each  trust.  In  setting  new  strategic  asset  mixes,  consideration  is  given  to  the  likelihood  that  the
selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates
the  long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.
Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.

In  2012,  the  Company  implemented  a  de-risking  strategy  for  the  American  Water  Pension  Plan  after  conducting  an  asset-liability  study  to  reduce  the
volatility of the funded status of the plan. As part of the de-risking strategy, the Company revised the asset allocations to increase the matching characteristics of
fixed-income  assets  relative  to  liabilities.  The  fixed  income  portion  of  the  portfolio  was  designed  to  match  the  bond-like  and  long-dated  nature  of  the
postretirement liabilities. In 2017, the Company further increased its exposure to liability-driven investing and increased its fixed-income allocation to 50% , up
from 40% , in an effort to further decrease the funded status volatility of the plan and hedge the portfolio from movements in interest rates.

In 2012, the Company also implemented a de-risking strategy for the medical bargaining trust within the plan to minimize volatility. In 2017, the Company
conducted a new asset-liability study that indicated medical trend inflation that outpaced the Consumer Price Index by more than 2% for the last 20 years. Given
continuously rising medical costs, the Company decided to increase the equity exposure of the portfolio to 30% , up from 20% , while reducing the fixed-income
portion of the portfolio from 80% to 70% . The Company also conducted an asset-liability study for the Postretirement Non-Bargaining Medical Plan. Its allocation
was adjusted to make it more conservative, reducing the equity allocation from 70% to 60% and increasing the fixed-income allocation from 30% to 40% . The
Postretirement Medical Non-Bargaining plan’s equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some non-union participants and resultant reduction in
the plan’s liabilities.

In 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over funded
postretirement  medical  benefits  bargaining  plan.  Given  the  change  in  funded  status,  the  Retirement  and  Benefit  Plans  Investment  Committee  (the  “Investment
Committee”), which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets, commissioned a new
asset-liability  study  for  the  postretirement  medical  bargaining  plan.  This  study  concluded  that  it  was prudent  to  decrease  the  risk  in  the  plan  and  to  remove  its
equity exposure. The study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for
future benefit payments of the liability. The Investment Committee agreed with the recommendations and voted to invest the postretirement medical bargaining
plan assets in fixed-income securities.

The restructuring of the plan was initiated towards the end of 2018. Once fully completed, the plans assets will be invested in fixed-income securities. The
majority  of  the  securities  will  be  used  to  match  the  projected  cash  flows  for  future  benefit  payments  of  the  liability.  Plan  assets  in  excess  of  those  securities
designed to match the long-term liabilities will be invested in shorter duration securities with a duration of about three years .

The Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixed
income,  equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attribution
analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to
adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.

In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to fixed income investments that are exposed to interest
rate  risk.  Increases  in  interest  rates  generally  will  result  in  a  decline  in  the  value  of  fixed  income  assets  while  reducing  the  present  value  of  the  liabilities.
Conversely,  rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  by
constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirement
medical  bargaining  plan,  all  of  its  assets  are  in  fixed-income  securities  and  the  asset  structure  is  designed  to  meet  the  cash  flows  of  the  liabilities.  This  design
reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.

Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time
it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if
necessary. Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) Trust assets include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan,
the New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining
Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.

Cash—Cash and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered

cash and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.

Equity  securities—For  equity  securities,  the  trustees  obtain  prices  from  pricing  services,  whose  prices  are  obtained  from  direct  feeds  from  market
exchanges, that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level
1. Certain equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued to
reflect  the plan fund’s interest  in the fund based on the reported  year-end  net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly  observable  or not available  on a
nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships, the assets as a whole are categorized
as Level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership vehicle
cannot be readily traded.

120

Table of Contents

Fixed-income securities—The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-
liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds
are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because the
valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded options and futures, for which
market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are
traded and are classified as Level 1.

Real estate fund—Real estate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is in

the form of a limited partnership.

REITs—REITs are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan fund’s interest in the fund based on the reported year-

end net asset value. Since the net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.

Guaranteed annuity contracts—Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market
values  are  determined  by  the  provider,  they  are  not  highly  observable  and  have  been  categorized  as  Level  3.  Exchange-traded  future  and  option  positions  are
reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily.

The pension and postretirement plans were negatively impacted from the market’s volatile and abrupt fourth quarter 2018 decline, that reversed all market

gains in 2018.

121

Table of Contents

On July 31, 2016, the other postretirement  benefit  plan  was re-measured  to reflect  a plan amendment,  which capped  benefits  for certain  non-union plan
participants. The re-measurement included a $156 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants, and resulted in an $89 million reduction to the
net accrued postretirement benefit obligation. The plan amendment will be amortized over 10.2 years, the average future working lifetime to full eligibility age for
all plan participants.

On    August  31,  2018  ,  the  Postretirement  Medical  Benefit  Plan  was  remeasured  to  reflect  a  plan  change.  The  plan  change  resulted  in  a    $175 million
reduction  in  future  benefits  payable  to  plan  participants,  and,  in  combination  with  other  experience  reflected  as  of  the  remeasurement  date,  resulted  in  a    $227
million  reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.

The accumulated postretirement plan assets exceed benefit obligations for all of the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans, except for the Northern

Illinois Retiree Welfare Plan.

In August 2006, the PPA was signed into law in the U.S. The PPA replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that
defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the
current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year
with short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding target and at-risk determination. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above
the  at-risk  threshold,  and  therefore  the  Company  expects  that  the  plans  will  not  be  subject  to  the  “at  risk”  funding  requirements  of  the  PPA.  The  Company  is
proactively monitoring the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.

Minimum  funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accounting
pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2019 to the
qualified pension plans. The Company plans to contribute to its 2019 other postretirement benefit cost for rate-making purposes.

Because the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The
assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital
markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.

The following table provides the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

The discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. At year-end 2011, the Company began using
an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons
and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would
produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management
fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes were
selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation
for  each  asset  class,  the  overall  expected  rate  of  return  for  the  portfolio  was  developed,  adjusted  for  historical  and  expected  experience  of  active  portfolio
management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company used
an  expected  return  on  plan  assets  of  5.95% to  estimate  its  2018  pension  benefit  costs,  and  an  expected  blended  return  based  on  weighted  assets  of  4.77% to
estimate its 2018 other postretirement benefit costs.

In  the  determination  of  year  end  2014  projected  benefit  plan  obligations,  the  Company  adopted  a  new  table  based  on  the  Society  of  Actuaries  RP  2014
mortality table including a generational BB-2D projection scale. The adoption resulted in a significant increase to pension and other postretirement benefit plans’
projected benefit obligations. In 2015, a new MP 2015 Projection Scale was issued, but not adopted by the Company since all of the experience upon which the MP
2015  Projection  Scale  is  based  was  considered  by  the  Company  in  selecting  its  2014  assumptions.  For  year-end  2017,  the  Company  retained  the  Society  of
Actuaries RP-2014 mortality table as its base mortality table but adopted the new MP-2017 generational projection scale to project mortality improvements after
2006. In 2018, the Company adopted the new MP-2018 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward.

The Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments  when the total expected future service of plan participants  is reduced by greater than 10% due to an

event that results in terminations and/or retirements.

124

Table of Contents

Cumulative gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized

over the expected average remaining future service of the current active membership for the plans.

Savings Plans for Employees

The Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that
are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject to
certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an
additional 5.25% of  base  pay  defined  contribution  benefit  for  union  employees  hired  on  or  after  January  1,  2001  and  non-union  employees  hired  on  or  after
January 1, 2006. Plan expenses totaled $12 million , $13 million and $9 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. All of the Company’s contributions are

Contingencies

The Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company has accrued
approximately  $54  million  of  probable  loss  contingencies  and  has  estimated  that  the  maximum  amount  of  losses  associated  with  reasonably  possible  loss
contingencies that can be reasonably estimated is $26 million . For certain matters, claims and actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. The
Company  believes  that  damages  or  settlements,  if  any,  recovered  by  plaintiffs  in  such  matters,  claims  or  actions,  other  than  as  described  in  this  Note  16—
Commitments and Contingencies , will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

On  June  8,  2018,  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  West  Virginia  granted  final  approval  of  a  settlement  class  and  global  class  action
settlement  (the  “Settlement”)  for  all  claims  and  potential  claims  by  all  putative  class  members  (collectively,  the  “Plaintiffs”)  arising  out  of  the  January  2014
Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement is July 16, 2018.

Under  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Settlement,  West  Virginia-American  Water  Company  (“WVAWC”)  and  certain  other  Company  affiliated  entities
(collectively, the “American Water Defendants”) did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the Plaintiffs in any of
the actions that were resolved. Under federal class action rules, claimants had the right, until December 8, 2017, to elect to opt out of the final Settlement. Less
than  100  of the   225,000  estimated putative class members elected to opt out from the Settlement, and these claimants will not receive any benefit from or be
bound by the terms of the Settlement.

Table of Contents

In June 2018, the Company and its remaining non-participating general liability insurance carrier settled for a payment to the Company of  $20 million , out
of a maximum of  $25 million  in potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy, in exchange for a full release by the American Water Defendants of all
claims against the insurance carrier related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.

As a result, the aggregate pre-tax amount to be contributed by WVAWC of the  $126 million  Settlement with respect to the Company, net of insurance
recoveries,  is    $23  million  .  As  of    December  31, 2018  , $40  million  of  the  aggregate  settlement  amount  of    $126  million  ,  reflecting  payments  made  by  the
Company under the terms of the Settlement, is reflected in Accrued liabilities, and the offsetting insurance receivables are reflected in Other current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has funded WVAWC’s contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.

In April 2017, the Lincoln County (West Virginia) Commission (the “LCC”) filed a complaint in Lincoln County state court against WVAWC and certain
other  defendants  not  affiliated  with  the  Company,  which  in  June  2017  was  transferred  to  the  West  Virginia  Mass  Litigation  Panel,  alleging  that  the  Freedom
Industries  chemical  spill  caused  a  public  nuisance  in  Lincoln  County  under  an  ordinance  enacted  by  the  LCC  in  March  2017,  more  than  three  years  after  the
Freedom Industries chemical spill occurred. The complaint sought an injunction against WVAWC that would have required the creation of various databases and
public repositories of documents related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as further study and risk assessments regarding the alleged exposure of
Lincoln County residents to the released chemicals. On July 31, 2018, WVAWC filed a motion to dismiss the LCC’s complaint. On December 12, 2018, the Mass
Litigation  Panel  granted  WVAWC’s  motion  to  dismiss  on  several  grounds,  including  being  barred  by  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations,  failure  to  allege  a
nuisance under applicable law, lack of standing, improper retroactive  application of the nuisance ordinance and violation of WVAWC’s due process. The LCC
voted not to appeal this decision.

Water
Main

Class
Action
Litigation

On the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of
WVAWC’s West  Relay pumping  station  located  in the  City of Dunbar. The failure  of the main  caused  water  outages  and low pressure  to up to approximately
25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26,
2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20%
by  the  next  morning.  The  second  repair  showed  signs  of  leaking  but  the  water  main  was  usable  until  June  29,  2015  to  allow  tanks  to  refill.  The  system  was
reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully
restored by July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.

On June 2, 2017, a class action complaint was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County against WVAWC on behalf of a purported class of
residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for
failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWC’s facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance
and operation of the water system. The plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of
use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.

In  October  2017,  WVAWC  filed  with  the  court  a  motion  seeking  to  dismiss  all  of  the  plaintiffs’  counts  alleging  statutory  and  common  law  tort  claims.
Furthermore,  WVAWC  asserted  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  of  West  Virginia,  and  not  the  court,  has  primary  jurisdiction  over  allegations  involving
violations  of  the  applicable  tariff,  the  public  utility  code  and  related  rules.  On  May  30,  2018,  the  court,  at  a  hearing,  denied  WVAWC’s  motion  to  apply  the
primary jurisdiction doctrine, and on October 11, 2018, the court issued a written order to that effect. The court has not yet issued a written order on WVAWC’s
motion to dismiss plaintiffs’  tort claims. The court has requested  the parties  submit a scheduling order with a trial date of August 26, 2019, and WVAWC has
sought to prevent further discovery while its motion to dismiss is pending.

The  Company  and  WVAWC  believe  that  WVAWC  has  valid,  meritorious  defenses  to  the  claims  raised  in  this  class  action  complaint.  WVAWC  is
vigorously  defending  itself  against  these  allegations.  Given  the  current  stage  of  this  proceeding,  the  Company  cannot  reasonably  estimate  the  amount  of  any
reasonably possible losses or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.

Compensation Plans, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the Company’s 2017 Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Less than one million
share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , because their effect would have
been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.

See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the forward sale agreements entered into by the Company on April 11, 2018 , and the

physical settlement of these agreements on June 7, 2018 .

Note 18: Fair Value of Financial Information

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Current assets and current liabilities—The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including

revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.

Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt—The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements
and long-term  debt  are categorized  within  the fair  value  hierarchy  based  on the inputs that are  used to value  each instrument.  The fair value  of long-term  debt
classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued
using observable and unobservable inputs. The fair values of instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3 are determined by a valuation model that is based on a
conventional  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  and  utilizes  assumptions  of  current  market  rates.  As  a  majority  of  the  Company’s  debt  is  not  traded  in  active
markets, the Company calculated a base yield curve using a risk-free rate (a U.S. Treasury securities yield curve) plus a credit spread that is based on the following
two factors: an average of the Company’s own publicly-traded debt securities and the current market rates for U.S. Utility A debt securities. The Company used
these yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield for the Level 2 and Level 3 securities. Additionally, the Company adjusted the base yield for specific features
of the debt securities including call features, coupon tax treatment and collateral for the Level 3 instruments.

The following tables provide the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and a fair

value adjustment related to interest rate swap fair value hedges (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy), and the fair values of the financial instruments:

Fair Value Measurements

To  increase  consistency  and  comparability  in  fair  value  measurements,  GAAP  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to  valuation

techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include  active  exchange-traded  equity  securities,  exchange-based  derivatives,  mutual  funds  and  money
market funds.

Level  2—Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  Level  1  that  are  directly  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability  or  indirectly  observable  through
corroboration  with  observable  market  data.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  2  inputs  include  fixed  income  securities,  non-exchange-based
derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.

Level  3—Unobservable  inputs,  such  as  internally-developed  pricing  models  for  the  asset  or  liability  due  to  little  or  no  market  activity  for  the  asset  or
liability.  Financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include  infrequently-traded  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds
subject to purchase and sale restrictions.

Restricted funds—The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of
facilities and from customers for future services under operations, maintenance and repair projects. Long-term restricted funds of $1 million and $1 million were
included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

Rabbi  trust  investments—The  Company’s  rabbi  trust  investments  consist  of  equity  and  index  funds  from  which  supplemental  executive  retirement  plan

benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deposits—Deposits  include  escrow  funds  and  certain  other  deposits  held  in  trust.  The  Company  includes  cash  deposits  in  Other  current  assets  on  the

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred  compensation  obligations—The  Company’s  deferred  compensation  plans  allow  participants  to  defer  certain  cash  compensation  into  notional
investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Company’s deferred
compensation  obligations  is  based  on  the  market  value  of  the  participants’  notional  investment  accounts.  The  notional  investments  are  comprised  primarily  of
mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.

Mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities—The Company utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typically designated as fair value hedges, to
achieve a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company also employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-
fixed interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest cost
on  existing  or  forecasted  debt.  The  Company  uses  a  calculation  of  future  cash  inflows  and  estimated  future  outflows,  which  are  discounted,  to  determine  the
current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility.

Other  investments—Other  investments  primarily  represent  money  market  funds  used  for  active  employee  benefits.  The  Company  includes  other

investments in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

The  following  table  provides  assets  measured  and  recorded  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  and  their  level  within  the  fair  value  hierarchy  as  of

As of December 31, 2017, Keystone’s goodwill balance was $91 million and its intangible asset balance was $8 million . Subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third
quarter of 2018, Keystone’s goodwill and intangible asset balances were $38 million and $3 million , respectively, as of December 31, 2018.

129

Table of Contents

The Company’s estimation of the fair value of the Keystone reporting unit as part of evaluating its goodwill and intangible asset for impairment represents a
Level 3 fair value measurement, due to the use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for further discussion.

Note 19: Leases

The Company has entered into operating leases involving certain real property, vehicles, and equipment. Rental expenses under operating leases were $35
million , $29 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The operating leases for real property, vehicles, and
equipment will expire over the next 40 years, seven years and five years, respectively. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one to 60 years.

The following table provides the minimum annual future rental commitment under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms

over the next five years and thereafter:

The Company has a series of agreements with various public entities (the “Partners”) to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to as “public-
private partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, the Company constructed utility plant, financed by the Company, and the Partners constructed utility
plant (connected to the Company’s property), financed by the Partners. The Company agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the
Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”), issued by the Partners under a state Industrial Development Bond
and Commercial Development Act. The Company leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both the Company and the Partners, under leases for
a period of 40 years.

The leases related to the portion of the facilities funded by the Company have required payments from the Company to the Partners that approximate the
payments  required  by  the  terms  of  the  IDBs  from  the  Partners  to  the  Company  (as  the  holder  of  the  IDBs).  As  the  ownership  of  the  portion  of  the  facilities
constructed by the Company will revert back to the Company at the end of the lease, the Company has recorded these as capital leases. The lease obligation and the
receivable  for  the  principal  amount  of  the  IDBs  are  presented  by  the  Company  on  a  net  basis.  The  carrying  value  of  the  facilities  funded  by  the  Company
recognized as a capital lease asset was $147 million and $150 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which is presented in Property, plant and
equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The future payments under the lease obligations are equal to and offset by the payments receivable under the IDBs.

As of December 31, 2018 , the minimum annual future rental commitment under the operating leases for the portion of the facilities funded by the Partners
that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year included in the preceding minimum annual rental commitments are $4 million in
2019 through 2023 , and $59 million thereafter.

Note 20: Segment Information

The  Company’s  operating  segments  are  comprised  of  the  revenue-generating  components  of  its  businesses  for  which  separate  financial  information  is
internally  produced  and  regularly  used  by  management  to  make  operating  decisions  and  assess  performance.  The  Company  operates  its  businesses  primarily
through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide a broad range of related and
complementary water and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the Market-Based Businesses .

The  Regulated  Businesses  segment  is  the  largest  component  of  the  Company’s  business  and  includes  20 subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater

services to customers in 16 states.

The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the Homeowner Services Group , which provides warranty protection programs to residential
and smaller commercial customers; the Military Services Group , which provides water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations;
and Keystone, which provides water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies.

130

Table of Contents

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies . The Regulated Businesses segment
and Market-Based Businesses include intercompany costs that are allocated by American Water Works Service Company, Inc. and intercompany interest that is
charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from
a  regulated  subsidiary  to  market-based  subsidiaries,  leased  office  space,  and  furniture  and  equipment  provided  by  the  market-based  subsidiaries  to  regulated
subsidiaries. “Other” includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Company’s operating segments, eliminations of inter-segment transactions, fair value
adjustments, and associated income and deductions related to the acquisitions that have not been allocated to the operating segments for evaluation of performance
and allocation of resource purposes. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures
evaluated by management.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-
15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls
and  procedures  were  effective  at  a  reasonable  level  of  assurance.  Our disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of  the  Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by  or  under  the  supervision  of  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief
Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  our  transactions  and  dispositions  of  our  assets,  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with  authorizations  of  our  management  and  our  directors,  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  as  of  December  31, 2018  ,  using  the  criteria  described  in  Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Management has excluded Pivotal from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 since it was acquired by the
Company in a business combination in June 2018. Pivotal is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from our assessment of
internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% and approximately 2% , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
, our management concluded that our internal control over

financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018 .

The  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2018  has  been  audited  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K .

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

On June 4, 2018 , the Company completed the acquisition of Pivotal. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  for  additional  information.  We  began  to  integrate  Pivotal  into  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  structure  and  expect  to  complete  this
integration  in  2019.  We  concluded  that  there  have  been  no  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  three  months  ended
December 31, 2018 , other than changes resulting from the acquisition of Pivotal, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As permitted by the SEC, management has elected to exclude Pivotal from its assessment of the effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2018 .

(v)    It is intended that any benefits under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of
Section  409A  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (“  Section  409A  ”),  provided  under  Treasury  Regulations  Sections  1.409A1(b)(4),  and
1.409A1(b)(9),  and  this  Agreement  will  be  construed  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  as  consistent  with  those  provisions,  and  to  the  extent  not  so  exempt,  this
Agreement  (and  any  definitions  hereunder)  will  be  construed  in  a  manner  that  complies  with  Section  409A.  For  purposes  of  Section  409A  (including,  without
limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A2(b)(2)(iii)), Executive’s right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether
severance payments, if any, or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder
shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision
of  this  Agreement  providing  for  the  payment  of  any  amounts  or  benefits  upon  or  following  a  termination  of  employment  unless  such  termination  is  also  a
“separation  from  service”  within  the  meaning  of  Section  409A  and,  for  purposes  of  any  such  provision  of  this  Agreement,  references  to  a  “resignation,”
“termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of a separation from service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of
Section  409A(a)(2)(B)(i),  then  to  the  extent  delayed  commencement  of  any  portion  of  such  payments  or  benefits  is  required  in  order  to  avoid  a  prohibited
distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided prior to the earliest of (a) the
expiration of the six (6) month period measured from the date of separation from service, (b) the date of Executive’s death or (c) such earlier date as permitted
under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such period, all payments deferred pursuant
to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. No interest shall be due on any amounts
so deferred.

(vi)        With  regard  to  any  provision  herein  that  provides  for  reimbursement  of  costs  and  expenses  or  in-kind  benefits,  except  as
permitted by Section 409A, (a) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (b) the amount of
expenses  eligible  for  reimbursement,  or  in-kind  benefits,  provided  during  any  taxable  year  shall  not  affect  the  expenses  eligible  for  reimbursement,  or  in-kind
benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, and (c) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of Executive’s taxable year following the taxable
year in which the expense was incurred.

5

(vii)        The  Company  makes  no  representation  or  warranty  and  shall  have  no  liability  to  Executive  or  any  other  person  if  any
compensation under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but does not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of,
Code Section 409A.

4.3.     Effect of Termination. Executive agrees that should Executive’s employment be terminated for any reason, Executive shall be deemed to

4.4.     Definition of Cause . For purposes of this Agreement, “ Cause ” means that the Executive (i) has breached any employment, service, non-
competition, non-solicitation, the Intellectual Property Agreement, dated September 20, 2018, and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 20, 2018, or
other agreement or contract with the Company, if any, and, if such breach can be cured by Executive, the breach remains uncured after Executive receives notice of
such breach and is afforded a period of not less than 30 days to remedy the breach; (ii) has persistently refused or willfully failed to perform substantially his duties
and responsibilities to the Company, which continues after the Executive receives notice of such refusal or failure and is afforded a period of not less than 30 days
to  remedy  the  refusal  or  failure;  (iii)  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  constitutes  disloyalty  to  the  Company  or  that  materially  damages  the  property,  business  or
reputation of the Company; (iv) has engaged in fraud, embezzlement, theft, material misappropriation with respect the business or assets of the Company, or the
proven commission of a felony; (v) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Company to persons not entitled to receive such information; or
(vi) has engaged in such other behavior that is significantly detrimental to the interests of the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors .

4.5.          Definition  of  Good  Reason  .  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  “  Good  Reason  ”  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the  following,
without Executive’s written consent: (a) a materially adverse change or material diminution in the title, duties, powers, authority or responsibilities of Executive;
(b) a material reduction in annual Base Salary below the amount set forth in Section 3.1 ; (c) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the
supervisor to whom Executive is required to report, from those in effect immediately prior to a Change of Control; (d) a material diminution in the budget over
which the Participant retains authority from that in effect immediately prior to a Change in Control; or (e) the Company’s requiring Executive to be based in any
office or location more than 50 miles from that location at which he performed his services immediately prior to a Change of Control, except for travel reasonably
required in the performance of Executive’s responsibilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive’s right to terminate his employment for Good Reason shall
be conditioned upon and may in no event be exercised until and unless Executive has provided written notice to the Company of the existence of the circumstances
providing grounds for termination for Good Reason within 30 days of the initial existence of such grounds and the Company has had at least 30 days from the date
on which such notice is provided to cure such circumstances, and has failed to do so.

4.6.     Definition of Change in Control . For purposes of this Agreement, “ Change in Control ” shall be deemed to have occurred if:

(i)        Any  “person”  (as  such  term  is  used  in  sections  13(d)  and  14(d)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “
Exchange Act ”))  becomes  (x)  during  the  12-month  period  ending  on  the date  of  any  acquisition  of  securities,  a  “beneficial  owner”  (as  defined  in Rule  13d-3
under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of American Water Works Company, Inc. (“ Parent Company ”) representing more than 35% of the
voting power of the then outstanding securities of Parent Company, or (y) a “beneficial owner,” as defined in clause (x) above, of more than 50% of the voting
power of the then outstanding securities of Parent Company;

(ii)        The  consummation  of  (A)  a  merger  or  consolidation  of  Parent  Company  with  another  corporation  where  the  stockholders  of
Parent Company, immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, will not beneficially own, immediately after the merger or consolidation, shares entitling such
stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of the surviving corporation would be entitled in the election of directors, or (B) a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent Company; or

6

(iii)    During any period of 12 consecutive months commencing on or after the Effective Date while the Omnibus Plan is in effect,
directors are elected such that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Parent Company are individuals who shall not have been members of such
board at the beginning of such 12-month period, except (x) in the case of a director’s death or (y) the election or nomination for election of each new director who
was not a director at the beginning of such 12-month period where such election was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office
who were directors at the beginning of such period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide for a different definition of a “Change of Control” in an LTPP grant document or agreement if such
LTPP grant is subject to the requirements of section 409A of the Code and the LTPP grant will become payable on, or in connection with, a Change of Control.

Agreement may be amended only with the written consent of the Executive and a duly authorized representative of the Company.

11.          Binding  Effect  of  Agreement  .  This  Agreement,  being  for  the  personal  services  of  Executive,  shall  not  be  assignable  by  Executive.  This
Agreement will bind the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of both Executive and the Company, and inure to the benefit of both Executive and

geographical area and maximum period of time, if applicable. and/or shall otherwise be deemed to be limited in such manner, as will permit enforceability by such
court or arbitrator. The Company and Executive further agree that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable in all circumstances for the protection of

Exhibit 10.9.2

NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS AND
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR
EMPLOYEES OF
AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.
AND ITS DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES

ARTICLE I

PURPOSE

AWW previously adopted this Plan, effective as of the Original Effective Date, in recognition of the services provided by certain key employees and officers of the
Employer. The Plan is intended to provide Group I Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to
receive Group I Matching Contributions on such deferrals, as well as to receive an additional deemed annual contribution from AWW for a portion of their Bonus,
plus the portion of their Base Salary that exceeds the limit on compensation under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. The Plan is also intended to provide Group II
Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to receive Group II Matching Contributions on such
deferrals, as well as to receive an additional deemed annual contribution from AWW for a portion of their Base Salary that exceeds the limit on compensation
under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. Further, the Plan is intended to provide Group III Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and
Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to receive Group III Matching Contributions on their Base Salary Deferrals.

AWW intends that the Plan shall at all times be maintained on an unfunded basis for federal income tax purposes under the Code and administered as a non-
qualified “top-hat” plan exempt from the substantive requirements of ERISA. AWW also intends that the Plan be operated and maintained in accordance with the
requirements of section 409A of the Code and the regulations and rulings thereunder. AWW desires to amend and restate the Plan, effective as of the Effective
Date, to incorporate prior amendments to the Plan, as well as to make certain design and clarifying changes to the Plan.

All capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in Article II below.

ARTICLE IV

PARTICIPATION

Section 4.01.      Group I Employees .

(a)     Employer Contributions . Each Plan Year, AWW will make a Group I Employer Defined Contribution to the Plan on behalf of each Group

I Employee who is employed by the Employer on the first day of such Plan Year. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.01, the amount of such Group I
Employer Defined Contribution for the Plan Year for each Group I Employee will be equal to the sum of (i) 5.25% of such Group I Employee’s Base Salary in
excess of the Compensation Limit, and (ii) 5.25% of such Group I Employee’s Bonus. Any Group I Employer Defined Contribution made under this Section
4.01(a) will be credited to the Group I Employee’s Group I Employer Defined Contribution Account as soon as administratively practicable following the close of
the Plan Year to which such Group I Employer Defined Contribution relates with respect to Base Salary for the Plan Year and as soon as administratively
practicable following the date on which the Bonus for the Plan Year is paid to the Group I Employee.

(b)     Deferral Contributions . Each Plan Year, all Group I Employees will be offered the opportunity to make a Base Salary Deferral with

respect to Base Salary to be paid in the Plan Year and a Bonus Deferral with respect to Bonus to be earned in the Plan Year. Any Group I Employee may enroll in
the Plan effective as of the first day of a Plan Year by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by a date set by the
Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year. Pursuant to said Enrollment Agreement, the Group I Employee shall irrevocably elect: (i) the
percentage (up to 20%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction), the Group I Employee’s Base Salary to be paid during that Plan Year
will be deferred to the Plan, and (ii) the percentage (up to 100%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction), the Group I Employee’s
Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year will be deferred to the Plan. Any Group I Deferral Contribution made under this Section 4.01(b) will be credited to the
Group I Employee’s Group I Deferral Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the month for which the deferral relates. Each Plan
Year, a Group I Employee must complete and fully execute a new Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event
prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which such Enrollment Agreement will become effective. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Group I
Employee experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, a Group I Employee may submit a request to the Committee on the form provided by the Committee to cease
the Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, being made in the current Plan Year on the Group I Employee’s behalf. If the Committee determines that the
Group I Employee has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, the cessation of the Group I Employee’s Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals will be
effective as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee’s determination, but not later than sixty (60) days following such determination. Any Group I
Employee who ceases Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not be eligible to elect to make any future
Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals for the remainder of the Plan Year in which the Unforeseeable Emergency occurs. For any future Plan Year, the
Group I Employee will need to execute a new Enrollment Agreement within the time period described above.

(c)     Matching Contributions . Each Plan Year, each Group I Employee who makes a Group I Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year will
receive a Group I Matching Contribution equal to (i) the sum of (A) 100% of his or her Group I Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the Group I
Employee’s Matching Compensation, and (B) 50% of his or her Group I Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of the next 2% of the Group I Employee’s
Matching Compensation, less (ii) the maximum amount of Matching Contribution that the Group I Employee is eligible to receive under the Savings Plan,
irrespective of whether the Group I Employee actually receives the maximum amount of Matching Contribution under the

6

Savings Plan for the Plan Year. Any Group I Matching Contribution made under this Section 4.01(c) will be credited to the Group I Employee’s Group I Matching
Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the Plan Year to which it relates (or such other time(s) as the Committee may determine, in its
sole discretion). No Matching Contributions will be made for a Group I Employee if such Group I Employee does not make any Group I Deferral Contributions for
the Plan Year.

(d)     Special Contribution . Prior to the Effective Date, AWW credited to the Special Contribution Account certain Special Contributions for the

benefit of those Group I Employees who were specifically designated by the Board to receive such Special Contributions, the value of which was determined by
the Board at such time. Only those Group I Employees who were specifically designated to receive the Special Contributions were eligible to receive such Special
Contributions.

(e)     Time of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.01(b),

the Group I Employee shall also designate the time on which such Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group I Employee. A
Group I Employee may elect one of the following as a permitted time for distribution of his or her Group I ‘ Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i)
Separation From Service; or (ii) a Specified Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the Group I Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment
Agreement as to the time of payment for his or her Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected
Separation From Service as the time of payment. A Group I Employee’s Group I Matching Contributions for such Plan Year shall be paid at the same time as the
Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to the Group I Employee and no Group I Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the
time when his or her Group I Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group I Employee shall separately select the time of the
distribution of his or her Group I Employer Defined Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted times set forth in this Section 4.01(e), provided,
that the Group I Employee files a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event prior
to the first day of the Plan Year for which the Group I Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group I Employee, the Group
I Employee shall be deemed to have elected Separation From Service as the time of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the time of
payment cannot be subsequently changed. The Plan Year election that shall apply as to the time of distribution for the Special Contribution shall be the eligible
Group I Employee’s 2008 Plan Year election.

(f)     Form of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.01(b),

the Group I Employee shall also designate the form pursuant to which such Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group I
Employee. A Group I Employee may elect one of the following forms for distribution of his or her Group I Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i) lump
sum or (ii) substantially equal annual installments that are paid over a period of between two (2) and ten (10) years, as designated by the Group I Employee in the
Enrollment Agreement; provided, however, that if the Group I Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment Agreement as to the form of payment for his
or her Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump sum as the form of payment. A Group I
Employee’s Group I Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid in the same form as the Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to
the Group I Employee and no Group I Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the form in which his or her Group I Matching Contributions for
the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group I Employee shall separately select the form of the distribution of his or her Group I Employer Defined
Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted forms set forth in this Section 4.01(f), provided, that the Group I Employee files a completed and fully
executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year for which such Group
I Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group I Employee, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump
sum as the form of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the form of payment cannot be subsequently changed. The Plan Year election
that shall apply as to the form of distribution for the Special Contribution shall be the eligible Group I Employee’s 2008 Plan Year election.

Year, but remains employed by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), AWW will credit to (A) such Group I Employee’s Group I
Employer Defined Contribution Account, at the same time that Group I Employer Defined Contributions are credited to the other Group I Employees’ Group I
Employer Defined Contribution Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group I Employee would have received if the Group I Employee continued as
such for the remainder of the Plan Year; and (B) such Group I Employee’s Group I Matching Account, at the same time that Matching Contributions are credited to
the other Group I Employees’ Group I Matching Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group I Employee would have received if the Group I
Employee continued as such for the remainder of the Plan Year. In addition, the Group I Employee’s Base Salary Deferral and/or Bonus Deferral for the Plan Year
will continue in effect for the remainder of the Plan Year. The Group I Employee shall not be eligible to receive any further Group I Employer Defined

Section 4.02.      Group II Employees .

(a)     Employer Contributions . Each Plan Year, AWW will make a Group II Employer Defined Contribution to the Plan on behalf of each
Group II Employee who is employed by the Employer on the first day of the Plan Year. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.02, the amount of such
Group II Employer Defined Contribution for the Plan Year for each Group II Employee will be equal to 5.25% of such Group II Employee’s Base Salary in excess
of the Compensation Limit. Any Group II Employer Defined Contribution made under this Section 4.02(a) will be credited to the Group II Employee’s Group II
Employer Defined Contribution Account as soon as administratively practicable following the close of the Plan Year to which such Group II Employer Defined
Contribution relates with respect to Base Salary for the Plan Year.

(b)     Deferral Contributions . Each Plan Year, all Group II Employees will be offered the opportunity to make a Base Salary Deferral with

respect to Base Salary to be paid in the Plan Year and a Bonus Deferral with respect to Bonus to be earned in the Plan Year. Any Group II Employee may enroll in
the Plan effective as of the first day of a Plan Year by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by a date set by the
Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year. Pursuant to said Enrollment Agreement, the Group II Employee shall irrevocably elect: (i) the
percentage (up to 20%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction); the Group II Employee’s Base Salary to be

8

paid during that Plan Year will be deferred to the Plan, and (ii) the percentage (up to 100%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction),
the Group II Employee’s Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year will be deferred to the Plan. Any Group II Deferral Contribution made under this Section
4.02(b) will be credited to the Group II Employee’s Group II Deferral Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the applicable month
for which the deferral relates. Each Plan Year, a Group II Employee must complete and fully execute a new Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date
set by the Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which such Enrollment Agreement will become effective. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if the Group II Employee experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, a Group II Employee may submit a request to the Committee on the
form provided by the Committee to cease the Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, being made in the current Plan Year on the Group II Employee’s
behalf. If the Committee determines that the Group II Employee has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, the cessation of the Group II Employee’s Base
Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals will be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee’s determination, but not later than sixty (60)
days following such determination. Any Group II Employee who ceases Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency
shall not be eligible to elect to make any future Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals for the remainder of the Plan Year in which the Unforeseeable
Emergency occurs. For any future Plan Year, the Group II Employee will need to execute a new Enrollment Agreement within the time period described above.

(c)     Matching Contributions . Each Plan Year, each Group II Employee who makes a Group II Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year will

receive a Group II Matching Contribution equal to (i) the sum of (A) 100% of his or her Group II Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the Group II
Employee’s Matching Compensation, and (B) 50% of his or her Group II Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of the next 2% of the Group II Employee’s
Matching Compensation, less (ii) the maximum amount of Matching Contribution that the Group II Employee is eligible to receive under the Savings Plan,
irrespective of whether the Group II Employee actually receives the maximum amount of Matching Contribution under the Savings Plan for the Plan Year. Any
Group II Matching Contribution made under this Section 4.02(c) will be credited to the Group II Employee’s Group II Matching Account as soon as
administratively practicable following the end of the Plan Year to which it relates (or such other time(s) as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion).
No Matching Contributions will be made for a Group II Employee if such Group II Employee does not make any Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan
Year.

(d)     Time of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.02(b),
the Group II Employee shall also designate the time on which such Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group II Employee. A
Group II Employee may elect one of the following as a permitted time for distribution of his or her Group II Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i)
Separation From Service; or (ii) a Specified Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the Group II Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment
Agreement as to the time of payment for his or her Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group II Employee shall be deemed to have elected
Separation From Service as the time of payment. A Group II Employee’s Group II Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid at the same time as the
Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to the Group II Employee and no Group II Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to
the time when his or her Group II Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group II Employee shall separately select the time of the
distribution of his or her Group II Employer Defined Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted times set forth in this Section 4.02(d), provided,
that the Group II Employee files a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event
prior to the first day of the Plan Year for which the Group II Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group II Employee, the
Group II Employee shall be deemed to have elected Separation From Service as the time of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the time
of payment cannot be subsequently changed.

(e)     Form of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.02(b),

sum or (ii) substantially equal annual installments that are paid over a period of between two (2) and ten (10) years, as designated by the Group II Employee in the

9

Enrollment Agreement; provided, however, that if the Group II Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment Agreement as to the form of payment for his
or her Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group II Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump sum as the form of payment. A Group II
Employee’s Group II Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid in the same form as the Group II Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to
the Group II Employee and no Group II Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the form in which his or her Group II Matching Contributions
for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group II Employee shall separately select the form of the distribution of his or her Group II Employer Defined
Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted forms set forth in this Section 4.02(e), provided, that the Group II Employee files a completed and
fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year for which such
Group II Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group II Employee, the Group II Employee shall be deemed to have elected
lump sum as the form of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the form of payment cannot be subsequently changed.

Employer Defined Contribution Account, at the same time that Group II Employer Defined Contributions are credited to the other Group II Employees’ Group II
Employer Defined Contribution Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group II Employee would have received if the Group II Employee continued as
such for the remainder of the Plan Year; and (B) such Group II Employee’s Group II Matching Account, at the same time that Matching Contributions are credited
to the other Group II Employees’ Group II Matching Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group II Employee would have received if the Group II
Employee continued as such for the remainder of the Plan Year. In addition, the Group II Employee’s Base Salary Deferral and/or Bonus Deferral for the Plan
Year will continue in effect for the remainder of the Plan Year. The Group II Employee shall not be eligible to receive any further Group II Employer Defined
Contributions and Group II Matching Contributions, or elect to make Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, as a Group II Employee for any future Plan
Year, unless the Group II Employee subsequently qualifies as a Group II Employee.

(ii)     Termination of Employment for any Reason Other Than Cause . If a Group II Employee ceases to be employed by an Employer

(including any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) at any time during the Plan Year for any reason other than a termination of employment by the
Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) for Cause, AWW will credit, as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Group
II Employee terminates employment with the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), to (x) the Group II Employer Defined Contribution

controlled group) for Cause, all Group II Employer Defined Contributions and all Group II Matching Contributions that have previously been credited on behalf of
such Group II Employee to his or her respective Account(s) shall be forfeited, and no such amounts shall be credited to such Group II Employee’s Account(s) for
the Plan Year in which such termination of employment occurs.

deferral relates. Each Plan Year, a Group III Employee must complete and fully execute a new Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the
Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which such Enrollment Agreement will become effective. Notwithstanding anything herein to

provided by the Committee to cease the Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, being made in the current Plan Year on the Group III Employee’s behalf. If
the Committee determines that the Group III Employee has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, the cessation of the Group III Employee’s Base Salary
Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals will be effective as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee’s determination, but not later than sixty (60) days
following such determination. Any Group III Employee who ceases Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall
not be eligible to elect to make any future Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals for the remainder of the Plan Year in which the Unforeseeable Emergency

under this Section 4.03(b) will be credited to the Group III Employee’s Group III Matching Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of
the Plan Year to which it relates (or such other time(s) as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion). No Matching Contributions will be made for a

Separation From Service; or (ii) a Specified Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the Group III Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment
Agreement as to the time of payment for his or her Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group III Employee shall be deemed to have elected
Separation From Service as the time of payment. A Group III Employee’s Group III Matching Contributions ‘for the Plan Year shall be paid at the same time as
the Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to the Group Ill Employee and no Group III Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election

Committee has designated as the Deemed Investment Options under the Plan, which for this purpose will include various funds designated by the Investment
Committee; provided, however, the Investment Committee reserves the right, on a prospective basis, to add or delete Deemed Investment Options.
Notwithstanding that the rates of return credited to Participants’ Account(s) under the Deemed Investment Options are based upon the actual performance of the
investment funds designated by the Investment Committee, AWW shall not be obligated to invest any amounts credited to a Participant’s Account(s) under this
Plan, or any other amounts, in such portfolios or in any other investment funds. The Plan shall be entirely unfunded and no provision shall at any time be made
with respect to segregating any assets of AWW or an Employer for payment of any distributions hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the
Investment Committee may, but shall not be required, to authorize the establishment of a trust or the purchase of insurance to serve as a funding vehicle for
AWW’s obligations with respect to the Plan. In any event, the obligation of AWW hereunder shall constitute a general, unsecured obligation, payable solely from
the general assets of AWW, and no Participant shall have any rights to any specific assets of AWW or any Employer.

Section 5.02.      Returns on Accounts . A Participant’s Account(s) shall be credited with returns in accordance with the Deemed Investment Options

elected by the Participant from time to time; provided, however, that if the Participant does not affirmatively elect a Deemed Investment Option, until the
Participant makes an affirmative election as to the Deemed Investment Options under the Plan, the Participant will be deemed to have elected the default
investment option that the Investment Committee has designated for this purpose. Unless otherwise provided under this Plan, Participants may allocate the amounts
credited to their Account(s), as applicable, among the Deemed Investment Options available under the Plan only in whole percentages of not less than one percent.
The rate of return, positive or negative, credited under each Deemed Investment Option is based upon the actual investment performance of the investment fund(s)
designated by the Investment Committee from time to time, and shall equal the total return of such investment fund net of asset based charges, including, without
limitation, money management fees, fund expenses and mortality and expense risk insurance contract charges.

Account(s) are deemed to be allocated on such basis as determined by the Investment Committee in its sole discretion. Each such change may include (a)

credited to the Participant’s Account(s) in the future, as the Participant may elect.

Account(s), including any earnings (positive or negative) deemed to be earned on such Account(s) in accordance with Section 5.02 through the day preceding such
date, less the amounts theretofore deducted from such Account(s).

Section 5.05.      Statement of Accounts . The Committee shall provide to each Participant, at such intervals determined by the Committee, a statement in

DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 7.01.      Distributions . If a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the vested amount credited to his or her Account(s) under the Plan

on account of Separation From Service, unless the Participant has filed an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section 7.05, such amount shall commence
to be distributed to the Participant in the form selected by the Participant for such Plan Year in the January of the Plan Year that follows the Plan Year in which his
or her Separation From Service occurs; provided, however, that if the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Separation From Service the
provisions of Section 7.02 below shall apply to such distribution. If a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the vested amount credited to his or her
Account(s) under the Plan on account of a Specified Distribution Date, unless the Participant has filed an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section
7.05, such amount shall

14

commence to be distributed to the Participant in the form selected by the Participant on such Specified Distribution Date. If a Participant elects to receive his or her
benefit in the form of a lump sum, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) attributable to the relevant Plan Years that will be distributed on account of a lump sum
will be determined as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefits in the form of
installments, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) that will be distributed on account of installments shall be equal to (A) the value of such Account as of the
first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs, divided by (B) the number of annual installment payments elected by the Participant for such Plan
Year’s contributions. The remaining annual installments shall be equal to (1) the value of such Account(s) as of the first business day of the month in which the
distribution occurs for such Plan Year’s contributions, divided by (2) the number of installments remaining for such Plan Year’s contributions.

Section 7.02.      Distributions on Separation From Service for Participants Who Are Deemed Specified Employees . Unless the Participant has filed

an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section 7.05, any Participant who is deemed a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Separation From
Service and designated (or is deemed to have designated) Separation From Service as the time for distribution of the vested amounts credited to his or her
Account(s) under the Plan for the Plan Year, shall commence to receive such distribution(s) under the Plan on the later of (i) as soon as administratively practicable
following the first day of the seventh month following the Participant’s Separation Date, but no later than thirty (30) days following such date, or (ii) the January of
the Plan Year that follows the Plan Year in which his or her Separation From Service occurs. If a distribution payable in installments is delayed because of the
immediately preceding sentence, the first distribution will be equivalent to the installment that the Participant would have received for the first six (6) months
following the Participant’s Separation From Service and the remaining installments shall be paid in accordance with the schedule designated by the Participant in
the Enrollment Agreement or Amended Enrollment Agreement, if any, as if the installments commenced on the Participant’s Separation Date. A distribution paid
pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be paid by AWW. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefit in the form of a lump sum, the value of the Participant’s
Account(s) attributable to the relevant Plan Years that will be distributed on account of a lump sum will be determined as of the first business day of the month in
which the distribution occurs. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefits in the form of installments, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) that will be
distributed on account of installments shall be equal to (A) the value of such Account as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs,
divided by (B) the number of annual installment payments elected by the Participant for such Plan Year’s contributions. The remaining annual installments shall be
equal to (1) the value of such Account(s) as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs for such Plan Year’s contributions, divided by
(2) the number of installments remaining for such Plan Year’s contributions.

Section 7.03.      Death of Participant . If a Participant dies prior to commencement of his or her benefit under the Plan, the Participant’s Beneficiary

shall receive a lump sum distribution of the entire vested amount credited to the Participant’s Account(s) as soon as administratively practicable following the date
of the Participant’s death, but no later than sixty (60) days following the date of such death. If a Participant dies after commencement of his or her benefit under the
Plan, the Participant’s Beneficiary shall receive a lump sum distribution of the remaining installments payable to the Participant under the Plan as soon as
administratively practicable following the date of the Participant’s death, but not later than sixty (60) days following the date of the Participant’s death. The value
of the Participant’s Account(s) subject to such distribution will be determined as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs.

Section 7.04.      Distribution While Employed on Account of an Unforeseeable Emergency . In the event that the Committee, upon written request of

a Participant, determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, AWW shall pay from the Participant’s Group I
Deferral Account, Group II Deferral Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as applicable, as soon as practicable following such determination, but not later than
sixty (60) days, an amount necessary to meet the Unforeseeable Emergency, after deduction of any and all taxes as may be required pursuant to Section 10.07.
Except as otherwise provided in regulations under section 409A of the Code, the amounts distributed to a Participant pursuant to an Unforeseeable Emergency
shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the
distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement of compensation by insurance or otherwise or
by liquidation of the Participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). With respect to that portion of
the Group I

15

Deferral Account, Group II Deferral Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as applicable, which is distributed to a Participant, in accordance with this Section
7.04, the value of such amount shall be reduced from the Participant’s Group I Deferral Account, Group II Deferral Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as
applicable.

Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, a Participant who receives a distribution pursuant to this Section 7.04 in any Plan Year shall not be entitled
to make any further Group I Deferral Contributions, Group II Deferral Contributions, or Group III Deferral Contributions, as applicable, for the remainder of such
Plan Year. No distributions pursuant to this Section 7.04 may be made from the Participant’s Group I Employer Defined Contribution Account, Group I Matching
Account, Group II Employer Defined Contribution Account, Group II Matching Account, Group III Matching Account or Special Contribution Account. The value
of the Participant’s Account(s) subject to such distribution will be determined as of the first business day of the month in the distribution occurs.

Section 7.05.      Change in Time and/or Form . A Participant may change the time and/or form of a distribution designated in an Enrollment Agreement
for a particular Plan Year by filing an Amended Enrollment Agreement with the Committee in accordance with the requirements of this Section 7.05. Specifically,
to change the time and/or form of a distribution for a particular Plan Year, the Amended Enrollment Agreement applicable to such distribution (i) will not become
effective for the twelve (12) month period after the date on which the Amended Enrollment Agreement is filed with the Committee; (ii) the distribution cannot
commence for a period that is not less than five (5) years from the date such payment was originally scheduled to commence pursuant to the original Enrollment
Agreement; and (iii) cannot be made less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the scheduled payment. Except as provided in Section 7.03, once payment
has commenced, the form of such payment shall not be modified.

Section 7.06.      Type of Distribution . All distributions from the Plan will be paid to the Participant in cash.

ARTICLE VIII

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

Section 8.01.      Amendment and Termination . The Plan may be amended, suspended, discontinued or terminated at any time by the Committee;

provided, however, that, except as provided below, no such amendment, suspension, discontinuance or termination shall reduce or in any manner adversely affect
the rights of any Participant with respect to benefits that are payable or may become payable under the Plan based upon the balance of the Participant’s Account as
of the effective date of such amendment, suspension, discontinuance or termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.01, if the
Committee determines that, in order to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, additional changes must be made to the Plan, then the
Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of a Participant, amend the Plan to comply with such requirements. If the Committee terminates the
Plan, Participants shall be entitled to a distribution of their benefit under the Plan if the termination is on account of a permitted distribution event under Treas.
Reg. §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A), (B), (C) or (D) and the requirements, as applicable, of such regulations are met with respect to the termination of the Plan and
distribution of benefits hereunder.

ARTICLE IX

CLAIMS PROCEDURES

Section 9.01.      Claim . A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit to which he or she is entitled under the Plan (hereinafter referred

to as a “Claimant”) may file a written request for such benefit with the Committee, setting forth the claim.

Section 9.02.      Claim Decision . Upon receipt of a claim, the Committee shall advise the Claimant that a reply will be forthcoming within ninety (90)

days and shall, in fact, deliver such reply within such period. The Committee may, however, extend the reply period for an additional ninety (90) days for
reasonable cause. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be provided a written explanation, using language calculated to be understood by the
Claimant, setting forth: (a) the specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b)

16

the specific reference to relevant provisions of the Plan on which such denial is based; (c) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the
Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation why such material or such information is necessary; (d) appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the
Claimant wishes to submit the claim for review; (e) the time limits for requesting a review; and (f) that the Claimant has the right to bring an action for benefits
under section 502 of ERISA following an adverse determination on review.

Section 9.03.      Request for Review . Within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Claimant of the written opinion described above, the Claimant may
request in writing that the Committee review its determination. The Claimant, or his or her duly authorized representative, may, but need not, review the pertinent
documents and submit issues and comments in writing for consideration by the Committee. If the Claimant does not request a review of the initial determination
within such sixty (60) day period, the Claimant shall be barred and estopped from challenging the determination.

Section 9.04.      Review of Decision . Within sixty (60) days after the Committee’s receipt of a request for review, it will review the initial determination.

After considering all materials presented by the Claimant, the Committee will render a written opinion, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
Claimant. If the decision is adverse, the written opinion will (a) set forth the specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the relevant provisions of
this Plan on which the decision is based; and (b) include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to,
and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim and that the Claimant may bring an action under section 502(a) of ERISA. If
special circumstances require that the sixty (60) day time period be extended, the Committee will so notify the Claimant and will render the decision as soon as
possible, but no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review.

Section 9.05.      Limitations on Claims . A Participant (or Beneficiary, if applicable) shall have no right to bring any action at law or equity regarding a

claim for benefits under the Plan, unless and until he or she exhausts his or her rights to review under Article IX in accordance with the time frames set forth
therein. No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under the Plan later than two years from the date of the Committee’s final determination
following the request for review of an adverse benefit determination made under Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable, analogous New
Jersey statute of limitations has run or will run before the aforementioned two-year period, the New Jersey statute of limitations is controlling. No action at law or
in equity shall be brought in connection with the Plan except in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.01.      Designation of Beneficiary . Each Participant may designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (which Beneficiary may be an entity other

than a natural person) to receive any payments which may be made following the Participant’s death. Such designation may be changed or canceled at any time
without the consent of any such Beneficiary. Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made in a form approved by the Committee and shall not be
effective until received by the Committee, or its designee. If no Beneficiary has been named, or the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries shall have predeceased
the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be, in descending order, (a) the Participant’s spouse, (b) the person, persons or trust designated by the Participant as direct or
contingent beneficiary in a manner prescribed by the Committee, or (c) if the Participant has no spouse and has failed to make an effective beneficiary designation,
the Participant’s estate. If a Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, the interests of such Beneficiaries shall be paid in equal percentages, unless the
Participant has specifically designated otherwise. If the Participant and his or her spouse are divorced or legally separated, the designation of the spouse as
Beneficiary under the Plan is automatically rescinded, provided the Plan receives notice prior to distribution, unless the Participant completes a new Beneficiary
designation naming the prior spouse as Beneficiary.

Section 10.02.      Limitation of Participant’s Right . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as conferring upon any Participant any right to continue in

the employment of the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), nor shall it interfere with the rights of the Employer (or any employer in
the Employer’s controlled group) to terminate the employment of any Participant and/or to take any personnel

17

action affecting any Participant without regard to the effect which such action may have upon such Participant as a recipient or prospective recipient of benefits
under the Plan. Any amounts payable hereunder shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to a Participant for the purposes of computing benefits to which
the Participant may be entitled under any other arrangement established by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) for the benefit of
its employees.

Section 10.03.      No Limitation on Employer Actions . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Employer from taking any

action which is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest. No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Employer as a
result of such action.

Section 10.04.      Obligations to the Employer . To the maximum extent permitted under section 409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations, if
a Participant becomes entitled to a distribution of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability
representing an amount owing to the Employer, then AWW may offset such amount owed to the Employer against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable.
Such determination shall be made by the Committee.

Section 10.05.      Nonalienation of Benefits . Except as expressly provided herein, no Participant or Beneficiary shall have the power or right to transfer
(otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), alienate, or otherwise encumber the Participant’s interest under the Plan. AWW’s obligations under
this Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (a) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of AWW’s assets or (b) any
corporation or partnership into which AWW may be merged or consolidated. The provisions of the Plan shall inure to the benefit of each Participant and the
Participant’s Beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or successors in interest.

Section 10.06.      Protective Provisions . Each Participant shall cooperate with AWW by furnishing any and all information requested by AWW in order

to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as AWW may deem necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be
requested by AWW. If a Participant refuses to cooperate, AWW shall have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan, other than payment to such
Participant of the then current balance of the Participant’s Accounts in accordance with his or her prior elections.

Section 10.07.      Withholding Taxes . AWW and/or the Employer may make such provisions and take such action as it may deem necessary or
appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which AWW and/or the Employer is required by any law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether
Federal, state or local, to withhold in connection with any deferrals to, amounts credited to and benefits payable under the Plan, including, but not limited to,
withholding of appropriate sums from any amount payable to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) under the Plan or otherwise payable to the Participant from
other sources. Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such deferrals, credits and benefits.

Section 10.08.      Unfunded Status of Plan . The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” plan of deferred compensation for Participants. Benefits

payable hereunder shall be payable out of the general assets of AWW, and no segregation of any assets whatsoever for such benefits shall be made. With respect to
any payments not yet made to a Participant, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights to assets that are greater than those of a general
creditor of AWW.

Section 10.09.      Severability . If any provision of this Plan is held unenforceable, the remainder of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect

without regard to such unenforceable provision and shall be applied as though the unenforceable provision were not contained in the Plan.

Section 10.10.      Governing Law . The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without

reference to the principles of conflict of laws.

Section 10.11.      Headings . Headings are inserted in this Plan for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of the

provisions of the Plan.

18

Section 10.12.      Gender, Singular and Plural . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter,

as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may read as the plural and the plural as the singular.

Section 10.13.      Notice . Any notice required or permitted under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered or sent by registered or

certified mail. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for
registration or certification. Mailed notice to the Committee shall be directed to AWW’s address. Mailed notice to a Participant or Beneficiary shall be directed to
the individual’s last known address in the Employer’s records.

Section 10.14.      Incapacity . In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a person who, in the sole judgment of the Committee, is

considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefore, the Committee may direct that such payment be made to any
person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment, to have assumed the care of such person. Any payment made pursuant to such determination shall constitute a
full release and discharge of the Committee, AWW and the Employer.

Section 10.15.      Section 409A . The Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code and its corresponding

regulations and related guidance, and shall be administered in accordance with section 409A of the Code to the extent section 409A of the Code applies to the Plan.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, elections to defer Base Salary and Bonus, as applicable, to the Plan, and distributions from the Plan, may only
be made in a manner and upon an event permitted by section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the
requirements of section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 409A of the Code, such
provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. Other than on a valid Enrollment Agreement or Amended Enrollment
Agreement, in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. For avoidance of doubt, deferrals under the Plan are
maintained on a Plan Year basis.

Executed this first day of January, 2017.

NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS AND
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR
EMPLOYEES OF
AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC.
AND ITS DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARIES

ARTICLE I

PURPOSE

AWW previously adopted this Plan, effective as of the Original Effective Date, in recognition of the services provided by certain key employees and officers of the
Employer. The Plan is intended to provide Group I Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to
receive Group I Matching Contributions on such deferrals, as well as to receive an additional deemed annual contribution from AWW for a portion of their Bonus,
plus the portion of their Base Salary that exceeds the limit on compensation under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. The Plan is also intended to provide Group II
Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to receive Group II Matching Contributions on such
deferrals, as well as to receive an additional deemed annual contribution from AWW for a portion of their Base Salary that exceeds the limit on compensation
under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. Further, the Plan is intended to provide Group III Employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their Base Salary and
Bonus on a tax-favored basis and to receive Group III Matching Contributions on their Base Salary Deferrals.

AWW intends that the Plan shall at all times be maintained on an unfunded basis for federal income tax purposes under the Code and administered as a non-
qualified “top-hat” plan exempt from the substantive requirements of ERISA. AWW also intends that the Plan be operated and maintained in accordance with the
requirements of section 409A of the Code and the regulations and rulings thereunder. AWW desires to amend and restate the Plan, effective as of the Effective
Date, to incorporate prior amendments to the Plan, as well as to make certain design and clarifying changes to the Plan.

Section 4.01.      Group I Employees .

(a)     Employer Contributions . Each Plan Year, AWW will make a Group I Employer Defined Contribution to the Plan on behalf of each Group

I Employee who is employed by the Employer on the first day of such Plan Year. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.01, the amount of such Group I
Employer Defined Contribution for the Plan Year for each Group I Employee will be equal to the sum of (i) 5.25% of such Group I Employee’s Base Salary in
excess of the Compensation Limit, and (ii) 5.25% of such Group I Employee’s Bonus. Any Group I Employer Defined Contribution made under this Section
4.01(a) will be credited to the Group I Employee’s Group I Employer Defined Contribution Account as soon as administratively practicable following the close of
the Plan Year to which such Group I Employer Defined Contribution relates with respect to Base Salary for the Plan Year and as soon as administratively
practicable following the date on which the Bonus for the Plan Year is paid to the Group I Employee.

(b)     Deferral Contributions . Each Plan Year, all Group I Employees will be offered the opportunity to make a Base Salary Deferral with

respect to Base Salary to be paid in the Plan Year and a Bonus Deferral with respect to Bonus to be earned in the Plan Year. Any Group I Employee may enroll in
the Plan effective as of the first day of a Plan Year by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by a date set by the
Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year. Pursuant to said Enrollment Agreement, the Group I Employee shall irrevocably elect: (i) the
percentage (up to 20%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction), the Group I Employee’s Base Salary to be paid during that Plan Year
will be deferred to the Plan, and (ii) the percentage (up to 100%) (whole percentages only) by which (as a result of payroll reduction), the Group I Employee’s
Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year will be deferred to the Plan. Any Group I Deferral Contribution made under this Section 4.01(b) will be credited to the
Group I Employee’s Group I Deferral Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the month for which the deferral relates. Each Plan
Year, a Group I Employee must complete and fully execute a new Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event
prior to the first day of the Plan Year in which such Enrollment Agreement will become effective. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Group I
Employee experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, a Group I Employee may submit a request to the Committee on the form provided by the Committee to cease
the Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, being made in the current Plan Year on the Group I Employee’s behalf. If the Committee determines that the
Group I Employee has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, the cessation of the Group I Employee’s Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals will be
effective as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee’s determination, but not later than sixty (60) days following such determination. Any Group I
Employee who ceases Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not be eligible to elect to make any future
Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals for the remainder of the Plan Year in which the Unforeseeable Emergency occurs. For any future Plan Year, the
Group I Employee will need to execute a new Enrollment Agreement within the time period described above.

(c)     Matching Contributions . Each Plan Year, each Group I Employee who makes a Group I Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year will
receive a Group I Matching Contribution equal to (i) the sum of (A) 100% of his or her Group I Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the Group I
Employee’s Matching Compensation, and (B) 50% of his or her Group I Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of the next 2% of the Group I Employee’s
Matching Compensation, less (ii) the maximum amount of Matching Contribution that the Group I Employee is eligible to receive under the Savings Plan,
irrespective of whether the Group I Employee actually receives the maximum amount of Matching Contribution under the

6

Savings Plan for the Plan Year. Any Group I Matching Contribution made under this Section 4.01(c) will be credited to the Group I Employee’s Group I Matching
Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the Plan Year to which it relates (or such other time(s) as the Committee may determine, in its
sole discretion). No Matching Contributions will be made for a Group I Employee if such Group I Employee does not make any Group I Deferral Contributions for
the Plan Year.

(d)     Special Contribution . Prior to the Effective Date, AWW credited to the Special Contribution Account certain Special Contributions for the

benefit of those Group I Employees who were specifically designated by the Board to receive such Special Contributions, the value of which was determined by
the Board at such time. Only those Group I Employees who were specifically designated to receive the Special Contributions were eligible to receive such Special
Contributions.

(e)     Time of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.01(b),

the Group I Employee shall also designate the time on which such Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group I Employee. A
Group I Employee may elect one of the following as a permitted time for distribution of his or her Group I Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i)
Separation From Service; or (ii) a Specified Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the Group I Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment
Agreement as to the time of payment for his or her Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected
Separation From Service as the time of payment. A Group I Employee’s Group I Matching Contributions for such Plan Year shall be paid at the same time as the
Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to the Group I Employee and no Group I Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the
time when his or her Group I Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group I Employee shall separately select the time of the
distribution of his or her Group I Employer Defined Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted times set forth in this Section 4.01(e), provided,
that the Group I Employee files a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event prior
to the first day of the Plan Year for which the Group I Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group I Employee, the Group
I Employee shall be deemed to have elected Separation From Service as the time of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the time of
payment cannot be subsequently changed. The Plan Year election that shall apply as to the time of distribution for the Special Contribution shall be the eligible
Group I Employee’s 2008 Plan Year election.

(f)     Form of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.01(b),

the Group I Employee shall also designate the form pursuant to which such Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group I
Employee. A Group I Employee may elect one of the following forms for distribution of his or her Group I Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i) lump
sum or (ii) substantially equal annual installments that are paid over a period of between two (2) and ten (10) years, as designated by the Group I Employee in the
Enrollment Agreement; provided, however, that if the Group I Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment Agreement as to the form of payment for his
or her Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump sum as the form of payment. A Group I
Employee’s Group I Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid in the same form as the Group I Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to
the Group I Employee and no Group I Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the form in which his or her Group I Matching Contributions for
the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. A Group I Employee shall separately select the form of the distribution of his or her Group I Employer Defined
Contribution for the relevant Plan Year among the permitted forms set forth in this Section 4.01(f), provided, that the Group I Employee files a completed and fully
executed Enrollment Agreement with the Committee by the date set by the Committee, but in any event prior to the first day of the Plan Year for which such Group
I Employer Defined Contribution relates, but if no such election is made by the Group I Employee, the Group I Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump
sum as the form of payment. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the form of payment cannot be subsequently changed. The Plan Year election

Year, but remains employed by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), AWW will credit to (A) such Group I Employee’s Group I
Employer Defined Contribution Account, at the same time that Group I Employer Defined Contributions are credited to the other Group I Employees’ Group I
Employer Defined Contribution Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group I Employee would have received if the Group I Employee continued as
such for the remainder of the Plan Year; and (B) such Group I Employee’s Group I Matching Account, at the same time that Matching Contributions are credited to
the other Group I Employees’ Group I Matching Accounts, an amount equal to the amount that the Group I Employee would have received if the Group I
Employee continued as such for the remainder of the Plan Year. In addition, the Group I Employee’s Base Salary Deferral and/or Bonus Deferral for the Plan Year
will continue in effect for the remainder of the Plan Year. The Group I Employee shall not be eligible to receive any further Group I Employer Defined
Contributions and Group I Matching Contributions, or elect to make Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals, as a Group I Employee for any future Plan
Year, unless the Group I Employee subsequently qualifies as a Group I Employee.

(ii)     Termination of Employment for any Reason Other Than Cause . If a Group I Employee ceases to be employed by an Employer

(including any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) at any time during the Plan Year for any reason other than a termination of employment by the
Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) for Cause, AWW will credit, as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Group

any, that is paid to the Group I Employee following the date of his or her termination of employment, and (y) the Group I Matching Account of such Group I
Employee, a Group I Matching Contribution equal to the amount that the Group I Employee accrued for the Plan Year ending on the date of such Group I
Employee’s termination of employment.

Employer’s controlled group) at any time during the Plan Year as a result of a termination of employment by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s
controlled group) for Cause, all Group I Employer Defined Contributions, Group I Matching Contributions and Special Contributions that have previously been
credited on behalf of such Group I Employee to his or her respective Account(s) shall be forfeited, and no such amounts shall be credited to such Group I
Employee’s Account(s) for the Plan Year in which such termination of employment occurs.

(b)     Matching Contributions . Each Group III Employee who makes a Base Salary Deferral for the Plan Year will receive a Group III Matching
Contribution equal to (i) 50% of his or her Group III Deferral Contribution, up to a maximum of 5% of the Group III Employee’s Matching Compensation, less (ii)
the maximum amount of Matching Contribution that the Group III Employee is eligible to receive under the Savings Plan, irrespective of whether the Group III
Employee actually receives the maximum amount of Matching Contribution under the Savings Plan for the Plan Year. Any Group III Matching Contribution made
under this Section 4.03(b) will be credited to the Group III Employee’s Group III Matching Account as soon as administratively practicable following the end of
the Plan Year to which it relates (or such other time(s) as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion). No Matching Contributions will be made for a
Group III Employee if such Group III Employee does not make any Base Salary Deferral for the Plan Year.

(c)     Special Contribution . Prior to the Effective Date, AWW credited to the Special Contribution Account certain Special Contributions for the

benefit of those Group III Employees who were specifically designated by the Board to receive such Special Contributions, the value of which was determined by
the Board at such time. Only those Group III Employees who were specifically designated to receive the Special Contributions were eligible to receive the Special
Contributions.

(d)     Time of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.03(a),
the Group III Employee shall also designate the time on which such Group III Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group III Employee. A
Group III Employee may elect one of the following as a permitted time for distribution of his or her Group III Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i)
Separation From Service; or (ii) a Specified Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the Group III Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment
Agreement as to the time of payment for his or her Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group III Employee shall be deemed to have elected
Separation From Service as the time of payment. A Group III Employee’s Group III Matching Contributions ‘for the Plan Year shall be paid at the same time as
the Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are paid to the Group Ill Employee and no Group III Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election
as to the time when his or her Group III Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to
the time of payment cannot be subsequently

11

changed. The Plan Year election that shall apply as to the time of distribution for the Special Contribution shall be the eligible Group III Employee’s 2008 Plan
Year election.

(e)     Form of Distribution . In addition to designating the percentage of deferrals in the Enrollment Agreement as provided in Section 4.03(a),

the Group III Employee shall also designate the form pursuant to which such Group III Deferral Contribution for the Plan Year shall be paid to the Group III
Employee. A Group III Employee may elect one of the following forms for distribution of his or her Group III Deferral Contributions for such Plan Year: (i) lump
sum or (ii) substantially equal annual installments that arc paid over a period of between two (2) and ten (10) years, as designated by the Group III Employee in the
Enrollment Agreement; provided, however, that if the Group III Employee does not make an election in the Enrollment Agreement as to the form of payment for
his or her Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year, the Group III Employee shall be deemed to have elected lump sum as the form of payment. A Group
III Employee’s Group III Matching Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid in the same form as the Group III Deferral Contributions for the Plan Year are
paid to the Group III Employee and no Group III Employee shall be eligible to make a separate election as to the form in which his or her Group III Matching
Contributions for the Plan Year shall be paid to him or her. Except as provided in Section 7.05, the election as to the form of payment cannot be subsequently
changed. The Plan Year election that shall apply as to the form of distribution for the Special Contribution shall be the eligible Group III Employee’s 2008 Plan
Year election.

be eligible to participate in the Plan as a Group III Employee until the following Plan Year.

(f)     Newly Eligible Group III Employees . Any individual who first qualifies as a Group III Employee during a particular Plan Year shall not

apply.

(g)     Change in Status . If at any time during the Plan Year a Group III Employee ceases to qualify as such, then the following provisions shall

(i)     Cessation as a Group III Employee . If a Group III Employee ceases to qualify as a Group III Employee at any time during the

Plan Year, but remains employed by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), AWW will credit to such Group III Employee’s Group
III Matching Account, at the same time that Group III Matching Contributions are credited to the other Group III Employees’ Group III Matching Accounts, an
amount equal to the amount that the Group III Employee would have received if the Group III Employee continued as such for the remainder of the Plan Year. In
addition, the Group III Employee’s Base Salary Deferral and/or Bonus Deferral for the Plan Year will continue in effect for the remainder of the Plan Year. The
Group III Employee shall not be eligible to receive any further Group III Matching Contributions, or elect to make Base Salary Deferrals and/or Bonus Deferrals as
a Group III Employee for any future Plan Year, unless the Group III Employee subsequently qualifies as a Group III Employee.

(ii)     Termination of Employment for any Reason Other Than Cause . If a Group III Employee ceases to be employed by an Employer

(including any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) at any time during the Plan Year for any reason other than a termination of employment by the
Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group) for Cause, AWW will credit, as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Group
III Employee terminates employment with the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), to the Group III Matching Account of such Group
III Employee a Group III Matching Contribution equal to the amount that the Group III Employee accrued for the Plan Year ending on the date of such Group III
Employee’s termination of employment.

(iii)     Termination of Employment for Cause . If a Group III Employee ceases to be employed by an Employer (or any employer in the

Employer’s controlled group) at any time during the Plan Year as a result of a termination of employment by the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s
controlled group) for Cause, all Group III Matching Contributions and Special Contributions that have previously been credited on behalf of such Group III
Employee to his or her respective Account(s) shall be forfeited, and no such amounts shall be credited to such Group III Employee’s Account(s) for the Plan Year
in which such termination of employment occurs.

ARTICLE V

INVESTMENT CREDITS AND FUNDING

Section 5.01.      Deemed Investment Options . The Deemed Investment Options available under the Plan shall consist of those funds that the Investment

Committee has designated as the Deemed Investment Options under the Plan, which for this purpose will include various funds designated by the Investment
Committee; provided, however, the Investment Committee reserves the right, on a prospective basis, to add or delete Deemed Investment Options.
Notwithstanding that the rates of return credited to Participants’ Account(s) under the Deemed Investment Options are based upon the actual performance of the
investment funds designated by the Investment Committee, AWW shall not be obligated to invest any amounts credited to a Participant’s Account(s) under this
Plan, or any other amounts, in such portfolios or in any other investment funds. The Plan shall be entirely unfunded and no provision shall at any time be made
with respect to segregating any assets of AWW or an Employer for payment of any distributions hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the
Investment Committee may, but shall not be required, to authorize the establishment of a trust or the purchase of insurance to serve as a funding vehicle for
AWW’s obligations with respect to the Plan. In any event, the obligation of AWW hereunder shall constitute a general, unsecured obligation, payable solely from
the general assets of AWW, and no Participant shall have any rights to any specific assets of AWW or any Employer.

Section 5.02.      Returns on Accounts . A Participant’s Account(s) shall be credited with returns in accordance with the Deemed Investment Options

elected by the Participant from time to time; provided, however, that if the Participant does not affirmatively elect a Deemed Investment Option, until the
Participant makes an affirmative election as to the Deemed Investment Options under the Plan, the Participant will be deemed to have elected the default
investment option that the Investment Committee has designated for this purpose. Unless otherwise provided under this Plan, Participants may allocate the amounts
credited to their Account(s), as applicable, among the Deemed Investment Options available under the Plan only in whole percentages of not less than one percent.
The rate of return, positive or negative, credited under each Deemed Investment Option is based upon the actual investment performance of the investment fund(s)
designated by the Investment Committee from time to time, and shall equal the total return of such investment fund net of asset based charges, including, without
limitation, money management fees, fund expenses and mortality and expense risk insurance contract charges.

Section 5.03.      Changes in Deemed Investment Options . A Participant may change the Deemed Investment Options to which the Participant’s

Account(s) are deemed to be allocated on such basis as determined by the Investment Committee in its sole discretion. Each such change may include (a)
reallocation of the Participant’s existing Account(s) in whole percentages of not less than one percent, and/or (b) change in investment allocation of amounts to be
credited to the Participant’s Account(s) in the future, as the Participant may elect.

Section 5.04.      Valuation of Accounts . The value of a Participant’s Account(s) as of any date shall equal the amounts theretofore credited to such

Account(s), including any earnings (positive or negative) deemed to be earned on such Account(s) in accordance with Section 5.02 through the day preceding such
date, less the amounts theretofore deducted from such Account(s).

Section 5.05.      Statement of Accounts . The Committee shall provide to each Participant, at such intervals determined by the Committee, a statement in

such form as the Committee deems desirable setting forth the balance standing to the credit of each Participant in each of his or her Account(s).

DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 7.01.      Distributions . If a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the vested amount credited to his or her Account(s) under the Plan

on account of Separation From Service, unless the Participant has filed an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section 7.05, such amount shall commence
to be distributed to the Participant in the form selected by the Participant for such Plan Year in the January of the Plan Year that follows the Plan Year in which his
or her Separation From Service occurs; provided, however, that if the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Separation From Service the
provisions of Section 7.02 below shall apply to such distribution. If a Participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the vested amount credited to his or her
Account(s) under the Plan on account of a Specified Distribution Date, unless the Participant has filed an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section
7.05, such amount shall commence to be distributed to the Participant in the form selected by the Participant on such Specified

14

Distribution Date. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefit in the form of a lump sum, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) attributable to the relevant
Plan Years that will be distributed on account of a lump sum will be determined as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs. If a
Participant elects to receive his or her benefits in the form of installments, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) that will be distributed on account of
installments shall be equal to (A) the value of such Account as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs, divided by (B) the number of
annual installment payments elected by the Participant for such Plan Year’s contributions. The remaining annual installments shall be equal to (1) the value of such
Account(s) as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs for such Plan Year’s contributions, divided by (2) the number of installments
remaining for such Plan Year’s contributions.

Section 7.02.      Distributions on Separation From Service for Participants Who Are Deemed Specified Employees . Unless the Participant has filed

an Amended Enrollment Agreement pursuant to Section 7.05, any Participant who is deemed a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Separation From
Service and designated (or is deemed to have designated) Separation From Service as the time for distribution of the vested amounts credited to his or her
Account(s) under the Plan for the Plan Year, shall commence to receive such distribution(s) under the Plan on the later of (i) as soon as administratively practicable
following the first day of the seventh month following the Participant’s Separation Date, but no later than thirty (30) days following such date, or (ii) the January of
the Plan Year that follows the Plan Year in which his or her Separation From Service occurs. If a distribution payable in installments is delayed because of the
immediately preceding sentence, the first distribution will be equivalent to the installment that the Participant would have received for the first six (6) months
following the Participant’s Separation From Service and the remaining installments shall be paid in accordance with the schedule designated by the Participant in
the Enrollment Agreement or Amended Enrollment Agreement, if any, as if the installments commenced on the Participant’s Separation Date. A distribution paid
pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be paid by AWW. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefit in the form of a lump sum, the value of the Participant’s
Account(s) attributable to the relevant Plan Years that will be distributed on account of a lump sum will be determined as of the first business day of the month in
which the distribution occurs. If a Participant elects to receive his or her benefits in the form of installments, the value of the Participant’s Account(s) that will be
distributed on account of installments shall be equal to (A) the value of such Account as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs,
divided by (B) the number of annual installment payments elected by the Participant for such Plan Year’s contributions. The remaining annual installments shall be
equal to (1) the value of such Account(s) as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs for such Plan Year’s contributions, divided by
(2) the number of installments remaining for such Plan Year’s contributions.

Section 7.03.      Death of Participant . If a Participant dies prior to commencement of his or her benefit under the Plan, the Participant’s Beneficiary

shall receive a lump sum distribution of the entire vested amount credited to the Participant’s Account(s) as soon as administratively practicable following the date
of the Participant’s death, but no later than sixty (60) days following the date of such death. If a Participant dies after commencement of his or her benefit under the
Plan, the Participant’s Beneficiary shall receive a lump sum distribution of the remaining installments payable to the Participant under the Plan as soon as
administratively practicable following the date of the Participant’s death, but not later than sixty (60) days following the date of the Participant’s death. The value
of the Participant’s Account(s) subject to such distribution will be determined as of the first business day of the month in which the distribution occurs.

Section 7.04.      Distribution While Employed on Account of an Unforeseeable Emergency . In the event that the Committee, upon written request of

a Participant, determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, AWW shall pay from the Participant’s Group I
Deferral Account, Group II Deferral Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as applicable, as soon as practicable following such determination, but not later than
sixty (60) days, an amount necessary to meet the Unforeseeable Emergency, after deduction of any and all taxes as may be required pursuant to Section 10.07.
Except as otherwise provided in regulations under section 409A of the Code, the amounts distributed to a Participant pursuant to an Unforeseeable Emergency
shall not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency, plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the
distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement of compensation by insurance or otherwise or
by liquidation of the Participant’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). With respect to that portion of
the Group I Deferral Account, Group II Deferral Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as applicable, which is distributed

15

to a Participant, in accordance with this Section 7.04, the value of such amount shall be reduced from the Participant’s Group I Deferral Account, Group II Deferral
Account, or Group III Deferral Account, as applicable.

Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, a Participant who receives a distribution pursuant to this Section 7.04 in any Plan Year shall not be entitled
to make any further Group I Deferral Contributions, Group II Deferral Contributions, or Group III Deferral Contributions, as applicable, for the remainder of such
Plan Year. No distributions pursuant to this Section 7.04 may be made from the Participant’s Group I Employer Defined Contribution Account, Group I Matching
Account, Group II Employer Defined Contribution Account, Group II Matching Account, Group III Matching Account or Special Contribution Account. The value
of the Participant’s Account(s) subject to such distribution will be determined as of the first business day of the month in the distribution occurs.

Section 7.05.      Change in Time and/or Form . A Participant may change the time and/or form of a distribution designated in an Enrollment Agreement
for a particular Plan Year by filing an Amended Enrollment Agreement with the Committee in accordance with the requirements of this Section 7.05. Specifically,
to change the time and/or form of a distribution for a particular Plan Year, the Amended Enrollment Agreement applicable to such distribution (i) will not become
effective for the twelve (12) month period after the date on which the Amended Enrollment Agreement is filed with the Committee; (ii) the distribution cannot
commence for a period that is not less than five (5) years from the date such payment was originally scheduled to commence pursuant to the original Enrollment
Agreement; and (iii) cannot be made less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the scheduled payment. Except as provided in Section 7.03, once payment
has commenced, the form of such payment shall not be modified.

Section 7.06.      Type of Distribution . All distributions from the Plan will be paid to the Participant in cash.

ARTICLE VIII

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

Section 8.01.      Amendment and Termination . The Plan may be amended, suspended, discontinued or terminated at any time by the Committee;

provided, however, that, except as provided below, no such amendment, suspension, discontinuance or termination shall reduce or in any manner adversely affect
the rights of any Participant with respect to benefits that are payable or may become payable under the Plan based upon the balance of the Participant’s Account as
of the effective date of such amendment, suspension, discontinuance or termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.01, if the
Committee determines that, in order to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, additional changes must be made to the Plan, then the
Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of a Participant, amend the Plan to comply with such requirements. If the Committee terminates the
Plan, Participants shall be entitled to a distribution of their benefit under the Plan if the termination is on account of a permitted distribution event under Treas.
Reg. §1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A), (B), (C) or (D) and the requirements, as applicable, of such regulations are met with respect to the termination of the Plan and
distribution of benefits hereunder.

ARTICLE IX

CLAIMS PROCEDURES

Section 9.01.      Claim . A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit to which he or she is entitled under the Plan (hereinafter referred

to as a “Claimant”) may file a written request for such benefit with the Committee, setting forth the claim.

Section 9.02.      Claim Decision . Upon receipt of a claim, the Committee shall advise the Claimant that a reply will be forthcoming within ninety (90)

days and shall, in fact, deliver such reply within such period. The Committee may, however, extend the reply period for an additional ninety (90) days for
reasonable cause. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be provided a written explanation, using language calculated to be understood by the
Claimant, setting forth: (a) the specific reason or reasons for such denial; (b) the specific reference to relevant provisions of the Plan on which such denial is based;
(c) a description of any

16

additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation why such material or such information is necessary; (d)
appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the Claimant wishes to submit the claim for review; (e) the time limits for requesting a review; and (f) that the
Claimant has the right to bring an action for benefits under section 502 of ERISA following an adverse determination on review.

Section 9.03.      Request for Review . Within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the Claimant of the written opinion described above, the Claimant may
request in writing that the Committee review its determination. The Claimant, or his or her duly authorized representative, may, but need not, review the pertinent
documents and submit issues and comments in writing for consideration by the Committee. If the Claimant does not request a review of the initial determination
within such sixty (60) day period, the Claimant shall be barred and estopped from challenging the determination.

Section 9.04.      Review of Decision . Within sixty (60) days after the Committee’s receipt of a request for review, it will review the initial determination.

After considering all materials presented by the Claimant, the Committee will render a written opinion, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
Claimant. If the decision is adverse, the written opinion will (a) set forth the specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the relevant provisions of
this Plan on which the decision is based; and (b) include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to,
and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim and that the Claimant may bring an action under section 502(a) of ERISA. If
special circumstances require that the sixty (60) day time period be extended, the Committee will so notify the Claimant and will render the decision as soon as
possible, but no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review.

Section 9.05.      Limitations on Claims . A Participant (or Beneficiary, if applicable) shall have no right to bring any action at law or equity regarding a

claim for benefits under the Plan, unless and until he or she exhausts his or her rights to review under Article IX in accordance with the time frames set forth
therein. No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under the Plan later than two years from the date of the Committee’s final determination
following the request for review of an adverse benefit determination made under Article IX. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable, analogous New
Jersey statute of limitations has run or will run before the aforementioned two-year period, the New Jersey statute of limitations is controlling. No action at law or
in equity shall be brought in connection with the Plan except in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.01.      Designation of Beneficiary . Each Participant may designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (which Beneficiary may be an entity other

than a natural person) to receive any payments which may be made following the Participant’s death. Such designation may be changed or canceled at any time
without the consent of any such Beneficiary. Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made in a form approved by the Committee and shall not be
effective until received by the Committee, or its designee. If no Beneficiary has been named, or the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries shall have predeceased
the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be, in descending order, (a) the Participant’s spouse, (b) the person, persons or trust designated by the Participant as direct or
contingent beneficiary in a manner prescribed by the Committee, or (c) if the Participant has no spouse and has failed to make an effective beneficiary designation,
the Participant’s estate. If a Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, the interests of such Beneficiaries shall be paid in equal percentages, unless the
Participant has specifically designated otherwise. If the Participant and his or her spouse are divorced or legally separated, the designation of the spouse as
Beneficiary under the Plan is automatically rescinded, provided the Plan receives notice prior to distribution, unless the Participant completes a new Beneficiary
designation naming the prior spouse as Beneficiary.

Section 10.02.      Limitation of Participant’s Right . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as conferring upon any Participant any right to continue in

the employment of the Employer (or any employer in the Employer’s controlled group), nor shall it interfere with the rights of the Employer (or any employer in
the Employer’s controlled group) to terminate the employment of any Participant and/or to take any personnel action affecting any Participant without regard to the
effect which such action may have upon such Participant

17

as a recipient or prospective recipient of benefits under the Plan. Any amounts payable hereunder shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to a Participant
for the purposes of computing benefits to which the Participant may be entitled under any other arrangement established by the Employer (or any employer in the
Employer’s controlled group) for the benefit of its employees.

Section 10.03.      No Limitation on Employer Actions . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Employer from taking any

action which is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest. No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Employer as a
result of such action.

Section 10.04.      Obligations to the Employer . To the maximum extent permitted under section 409A of the Code and its corresponding regulations, if
a Participant becomes entitled to a distribution of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability
representing an amount owing to the Employer, then AWW may offset such amount owed to the Employer against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable.
Such determination shall be made by the Committee.

Section 10.05.      Nonalienation of Benefits . Except as expressly provided herein, no Participant or Beneficiary shall have the power or right to transfer
(otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), alienate, or otherwise encumber the Participant’s interest under the Plan. AWW’s obligations under
this Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (a) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of AWW’s assets or (b) any
corporation or partnership into which AWW may be merged or consolidated. The provisions of the Plan shall inure to the benefit of each Participant and the
Participant’s Beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or successors in interest.

Section 10.06.      Protective Provisions . Each Participant shall cooperate with AWW by furnishing any and all information requested by AWW in order

to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as AWW may deem necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be
requested by AWW. If a Participant refuses to cooperate, AWW shall have no further obligation to the Participant under the Plan, other than payment to such
Participant of the then current balance of the Participant’s Accounts in accordance with his or her prior elections.

Section 10.07.      Withholding Taxes . AWW and/or the Employer may make such provisions and take such action as it may deem necessary or
appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which AWW and/or the Employer is required by any law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether
Federal, state or local, to withhold in connection with any deferrals to, amounts credited to and benefits payable under the Plan, including, but not limited to,
withholding of appropriate sums from any amount payable to the Participant (or his or her Beneficiary) under the Plan or otherwise payable to the Participant from
other sources. Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such deferrals, credits and benefits.

Section 10.08.      Unfunded Status of Plan . The Plan is intended to constitute an “unfunded” plan of deferred compensation for Participants. Benefits

payable hereunder shall be payable out of the general assets of AWW, and no segregation of any assets whatsoever for such benefits shall be made. With respect to
any payments not yet made to a Participant, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights to assets that are greater than those of a general
creditor of AWW.

Section 10.09.      Severability . If any provision of this Plan is held unenforceable, the remainder of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect

without regard to such unenforceable provision and shall be applied as though the unenforceable provision were not contained in the Plan.

Section 10.10.      Governing Law . The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without

reference to the principles of conflict of laws.

Section 10.11.      Headings . Headings are inserted in this Plan for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of the

provisions of the Plan.

18

Section 10.12.      Gender, Singular and Plural . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter,

as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may read as the plural and the plural as the singular.

Section 10.13.      Notice . Any notice required or permitted under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered or sent by registered or

certified mail. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for
registration or certification. Mailed notice to the Committee shall be directed to AWW’s address. Mailed notice to a Participant or Beneficiary shall be directed to
the individual’s last known address in the Employer’s records.

Section 10.14.      Incapacity . In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a person who, in the sole judgment of the Committee, is

considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefore, the Committee may direct that such payment be made to any
person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment, to have assumed the care of such person. Any payment made pursuant to such determination shall constitute a
full release and discharge of the Committee, AWW and the Employer.

Section 10.15.      Section 409A . The Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code and its corresponding

regulations and related guidance, and shall be administered in accordance with section 409A of the Code to the extent section 409A of the Code applies to the Plan.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, elections to defer Base Salary and Bonus, as applicable, to the Plan, and distributions from the Plan, may only
be made in a manner and upon an event permitted by section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the
requirements of section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 409A of the Code, such
provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. Other than on a valid Enrollment Agreement or Amended Enrollment
Agreement, in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment. For avoidance of doubt, deferrals under the Plan are
maintained on a Plan Year basis.

Executed this first day of May, 2018.
