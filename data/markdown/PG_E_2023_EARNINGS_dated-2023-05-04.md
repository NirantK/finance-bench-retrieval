OAKLAND — PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) recorded first-quarter 2023 income available for
common shareholders of $569 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, as reported in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with income available for
common shareholders of $475 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2022.

The increase in GAAP results was primarily driven by lower costs related to investigation
remedies, prior period net regulatory impact, PG&E Corporation’s and Pacific Gas and Electric
Company’s (Utility) reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
(Chapter 11), and higher Fire Victim Trust tax benefit net of securitization.

“The team at PG&E is driving forward in reducing physical risk on our system and financial risk
—both of which benefit our customers and our investors,” said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E
Corporation.  “After the first quarter of 2023, we are on track to meet our earnings targets as
well as our efforts to reduce non-fuel operating and maintenance costs by 2%, and we look
forward to continued predictable results in the months ahead.”

Non-GAAP Core Earnings

PG&E Corporation’s non-GAAP core earnings, which exclude non-core items, were $615
million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $639 million, or
$0.30 per diluted share, during the same period in 2022.

The change in quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP core earnings per diluted share was primarily
driven by lower operating and maintenance costs due to crews reallocated to storm response
activity, which allowed for redeployment of other resources. Results are also driven by other
miscellaneous items, partially offset by timing items.

Non-core items, which management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings,
totaled $46 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2023, compared
with $164 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, during the same period in 2022.

PG&E Corporation uses “non-GAAP core earnings,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in
order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items. See the
accompanying tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP core earnings to consolidated earnings
available for common shareholders.

2023 Guidance

PG&E Corporation is updating 2023 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $1.00 to $1.13 per
diluted share. Factors driving GAAP earnings include costs related to unrecoverable interest
expense of $370 million to $430 million after tax and other earnings factors, including allowance
for funds used during construction equity, incentive revenues, tax benefits, and cost savings, net
of below-the-line costs. Additional factors include the amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset and
accretion of the related Wildfire Fund liability, investigation remedies, PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s reorganization cases under Chapter 11, and wildfire-related costs, partially offset by
Fire Victim Trust tax benefits and prior period net regulatory impact.

The guidance range for projected 2023 non-GAAP core earnings is reaffirmed at $1.19 to $1.23
per diluted share. The guidance range for non-core items, which management does not
consider representative of ongoing earnings, is updated to $200 million to $390 million after tax.

Guidance is based on various assumptions and forecasts, including those relating to authorized
revenues, future expenses, capital expenditures, rate base, equity issuances, and certain other
factors.

Operating Loss monetization. Fire Victim Trust tax benefits include tax benefits recognized upon the sale of shares of
PG&E Corporation common stock by the Fire Victim Trust, which PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected to
treat as a grantor trust. Also included are the earnings-impacting investment losses, net of gains, associated with

the 120,000,000 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock sold in the aggregate by the Fire Victim Trust as of
April 26, 2023, whereas the high case reflects an assumption that the Fire Victim Trust sells the remaining

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company

Non-GAAP Core Earnings and Non-GAAP Core EPS

“Non-GAAP core earnings” and “Non-GAAP core EPS,” also referred to as “non-GAAP core earnings per share,” are
non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP core earnings is calculated as income available for common shareholders
less non-core items. “Non-core items” include items that management does not consider representative of ongoing
earnings and affect comparability of financial results between periods, consisting of the items listed in Exhibit A. Non-
GAAP core EPS is calculated as non-GAAP core earnings divided by common shares outstanding (taken on a basic basis
in the event of a GAAP loss and a diluted basis in the event of a GAAP gain).

PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on “non-GAAP core earnings” and
“non-GAAP core EPS” in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial
performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of non-core items.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility
use non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS to understand and compare operating results across reporting
periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short- and long-term operating planning, and
employee incentive compensation. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that non-GAAP core earnings and non-
GAAP core EPS provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison
against historical results and expectations for future performance. With respect to our projection of non-GAAP core EPS
for the years 2024-2026, PG&E Corporation is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the reconciling items that may
affect GAAP net income without unreasonable effort. The reconciling items are primarily due to the future impact of
wildfire-related costs, timing of regulatory recoveries, special tax items, and investigation remedies. These reconciling
items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, the
GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP core earnings and non-GAAP core EPS are not substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures such as
consolidated income available for common shareholders and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies.
