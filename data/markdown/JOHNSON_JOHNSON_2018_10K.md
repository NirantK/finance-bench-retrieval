This Annual Report on Form 10-K and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with,
among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and
dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.

Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to
uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if
underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition
could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to
rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition
•

Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s
continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory
approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and
technologies in the United States and other important markets;

The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share
losses;

Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar
or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges,
potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;

Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process
obsolescence;

Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;

Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and

Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the
Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.

Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity
•

Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action
on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation
expense and share price impact;

•

•

•

Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product
liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;

Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability,
personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;

Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which
carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;

•

•

•

•

•

Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or
government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;

Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new
products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products
and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials;

Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including,
requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation;

Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the
Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to
additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and

Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends
•

Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and
other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care
expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs
and price increases;

•

•

•

•

Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship
and budgetary constraints;

Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development
collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to
competitive pressures;

The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not
be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and

The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to
realize than expected.

Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally
• Market conditions and the possibility that the Company’s share repurchase program may be delayed, suspended or discontinued;

•

•

•

•

•

Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and
resulting margins;

Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade
restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;

The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental
controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;

Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions
in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and
integrity of the Company's products and operations; and

The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and
instability of financial and other markets.

Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations
•

Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or
involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory
action;

•

Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational,
competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;

•

•

Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that
may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and

The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized
or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with
the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products.

Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that
could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete
statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made
from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

PART I

Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and
development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than
260 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the
resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical
and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating
companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business
segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.

Segments of Business

The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this

item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Consumer

The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s

health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S® line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE® product line. Major brands in
Beauty include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; DABAO™; JOHNSON’S® Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS®; NEUTROGENA® and OGX®
product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products;

Women’s Health outside of North America are STAYFREE® and CAREFREE® sanitary pads and o.b.® tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the
BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN® First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to
retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.

Pharmaceutical

The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and

psoriasis), Infectious Diseases and Vaccines (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia),
Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer and hematologic malignancies), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes) and Pulmonary
Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care
professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-
mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active
psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), an intravenous

schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have
been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA® for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone long-acting injection), for the
treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic
castration-

1

resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell
malignancies, or blood cancers, chronic graft versus host disease and Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX® (daratumumab), a treatment for
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; VELCADE® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma; PROCRIT®/EPREX® (epoetin

prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce
the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT
and PE; INVOKANA® (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET®/VOKANAMET® (canagliflozin/metformin HCl),
a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET®
XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride
extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT® (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI® (selexipag), the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin
pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain
active lifecycle development programs.

Medical Devices

The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and
neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals
and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic
products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and
disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; and vision products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and
laser refractive surgery.

Geographic Areas

The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 260 operating companies located in more than 60 countries, including the U.S.,

which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those
described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and
methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those
developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.

Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment

and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system
uncertainties.

Raw Materials

Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the

temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.

Patents

The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are

licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries
face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key
pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the
Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Sales of the Company’s 2nd largest product, STELARA® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 6.3% of the Company's total revenues for

fiscal 2018. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.

There is one set of granted patents related specifically to STELARA®. This set of patents is owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. These patents are in force in the U.S. and many countries outside the

2

United States. In the U.S., the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to a patent term extension. In Europe, the latest projected
expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a Supplemental Patent Certificate (patent term extension). In most other countries, the latest projected
expiration date is 2021.

In addition to competing in the immunology market with STELARA®, the Company is currently marketing SIMPONI® (golimumab) and
SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years. The Company also markets
REMICADE® (infliximab) in the immunology market which is the Company’s largest product. Patents on this product have expired and the Food and Drug
Administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the U.S. in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched since then. For a
more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE®, see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings - Intellectual Property -
Pharmaceutical - REMICADE® Related Cases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Trademarks

The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by

all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company
considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.

Seasonality

Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in

other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.

Competition

In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the
development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative
products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of
its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of
customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.

Environment

The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations

comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change
during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.

Regulation

The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the

general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by
various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in
major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased
regulation.

The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and
legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write
prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market
place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of
health care generally.

3

U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA). These

have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and
potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry.

The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product

withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate
product recalls.

In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and

state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing

regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of
materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In

addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below.
Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all
potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition
could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.

Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing
pricing pressures.

Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government
healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting
downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of
Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing
pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU
and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or
reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.

The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.

In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as
patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or
consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict
the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these
matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The
resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results
of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased
purchasing third-party product liability insurance.

Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and
cause reputational damage.

Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence,
can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries),
private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to
brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government
investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation
costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in
statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in
the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any
time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which introduced significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law
that will have a meaningful impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant
judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, which should be final by
June 22, 2019 (18 months after enactment),

5

may result in adjustments that could materially affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the
period in which the adjustments are made.

On September 28, 2018, the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum
has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform will take place on May 19th, 2019. If the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the
measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal
implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the
Company’s operating results.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In
connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to
disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries.
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax
authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.

The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses.

The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various
countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the
Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights.
The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or
that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.

Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences,
oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the
Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the
competitive position and sales of the products in question.

The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic
versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010,
which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created
mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created
under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries.

In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent
infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a
very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, “Legal
Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s
earnings.

The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with
companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived
product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to
acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in
significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or

6

less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company,
could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment
in the related product development.

For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors
gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for
a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are
especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make
the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from
other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products,
this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.

Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an
adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.

The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the
evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue
losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products
introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to
develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval,
and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.

The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and
licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology
products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development
programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’
future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property
protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from
competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the
marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or
uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and
efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.

The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government
investigations, legal actions and penalties.

Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local
government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and
penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing
and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of
health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and
prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare
programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current
investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.

The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including
those listed below.

7

Foreign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2018, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe,
8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the
U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are
translated into U.S. dollars.

Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high
inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary,
as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost
reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In
addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively
impact the Company’s operating results.

Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or
other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the
Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal
under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced
imports has grown significantly.

Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with
respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded
companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the
purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore
involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human
pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s
interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the
FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and
penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal
proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health
care programs.

Other Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:

•
•

•
•
•

protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;
compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture
or sell its products in the relevant market;
diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;
potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; and
disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics.

Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.

The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The
Company's subsidiaries operate 111 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past,
and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions
can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires),
natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and
difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs
associated with addressing the shortage.

The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in
delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.

The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of
their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver
those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our
near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.

Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and
quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing
agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or
inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience
power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency,
the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other
qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.

An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation

To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their
vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data
that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the
security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company
continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the
Company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact
to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with
the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in
reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity
insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses.

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the

world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this
Report.

The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S.

locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers.

The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition.

McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the

FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the "Consent Decree"). Following FDA inspections in 2015,
McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and
commercial production has restarted.

Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three
facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times
until at least 2020.

For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 18 “Segments of

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,
manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the
primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.

The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care
(divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the
professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.

The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the

resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business
segments.

In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product

lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as
protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.

Management’s Objectives
With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for
humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this
common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.
The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products
and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. In 2018, $10.8 billion was invested in
research and development and $0.9 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create
value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.

A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 135,100 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located

in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every
employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive
resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on
addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare
professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.

The Beauty franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 4.3% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA®, OGX®
and AVEENO® products as well as strength of DR. CI: LABO and DABAO® products outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by the divestiture of
NIZORAL®.

The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.3 billion increased 5.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by share,
consumption and market growth across multiple brands including ZYRTEC® , TYLENOL® and Children's MOTRIN®, as well as digestive health products
and anti-smoking aids. Additionally, sales from the recent U.S. acquisition of Zarbee's Inc. contributed approximately 0.9% to growth.

The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 3.0% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON's® share decline
and increased trade promotions due to the JOHNSON's® baby relaunch and the negative impact of currency. This was partially offset by strong growth of
AVEENO® baby driven by geographic expansion.

The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong marketing campaigns and new

product launches.

The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2018, a decrease of 0.1% as compared to the prior year. Growth in Latin America was offset

by the negative impact of currency.

The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2018, a decrease of 13.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of

COMPEED®.

Consumer segment sales in 2017 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 2.2% from 2016, which included 1.3% operational growth and a positive currency

impact of 0.9%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.6 billion, an increase of 2.7%. International sales were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1.9%, which
included 0.4% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.5%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 1.8% on the

Immunology products sales were $13.1 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by strong

uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, strong launch uptake of TREMFYA® (guselkumab), expanded indications of
SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of
REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.

The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been
introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will
likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was
introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a
further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the
REMICADE® patents.

Infectious disease products sales were $3.3 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of

PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat), EDURANT®/rilpivirine, and the launch of SYMTUZA® and JULUCA® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) was
partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA®(darunavir).

Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables

INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® were partially offset by cannibalization of
RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA®/methylphenidate.

Oncology products achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 35.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth

were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient
uptake globally and sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by LATITUDE data and market growth. Additionally, sales from the launch of
ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the U.S., seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA® prior
to expiration of its applicable patents. These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In October 2018, the
Court issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the applicable patent. Janssen has appealed the Court’s decision. In November 2018, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA® have
entered the market, resulting in a decline in sales of ZYTIGA® in the United States. In 2018, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.8 billion for
ZYTIGA®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA®.

The Pulmonary Hypertension therapeutic area was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. Sales in 2018 represented a full

year as compared to half a year in 2017. Sales of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were positively impacted by market growth and
share gains while sales of TRACLEER® (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT® and generics.

Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.8 billion, a decline of 7.5% as compared to the prior year. Lower sales of

INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price discounts, higher rebates and market share decline
driven by competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset by an
increase in market share.

The Surgery franchise sales were $9.9 billion in 2018, an increase of 3.6% from 2017. Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by
endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by wound care products. Growth in Specialty Surgery was
primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization Products.

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.9% from 2017. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the
Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine partially offset by new product launches. The decline in knees was primarily due to competitive
pressure in the U.S. partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Growth in hips and trauma was due to continued uptake of new products.

The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.1% from 2017. Growth was primarily driven by strength of the

astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS® contact lenses category. Surgical growth was driven by cataract performance primarily outside the
U.S.

The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) sales were $2.6
billion, an increase of 15.2% from 2017. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued
uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter.

The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 37.5% from 2017. The decline was primarily due to divestiture of its LifeScan
business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017.

The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a

positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an
increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an

22

operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the
worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016.

Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $18.0 billion, $17.7 billion and $19.8 billion for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.1%, 23.1%, and 27.5% in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

In 2018, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 33.2% from 33.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower
inventory step-up costs related to the Actelion acquisition and favorable product and segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales from the
Pharmaceutical segment. This was mostly offset by higher amortization expense primarily related to the Actelion acquisition on June 16, 2017. Intangible
asset amortization expense of $4.4 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2018 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2017. There was a decrease in the
percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs relative to sales
growth in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable segment mix.

In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.3% from 30.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable
increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily
Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There
was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments
in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix.

Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering,
testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory
compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and
innovative products. In 2018, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 but decreased as a percent of
sales. The decrease as a percent of sales in the Pharmaceutical segment was attributable to lower costs relative to sales growth. The increased dollar spend
in the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical segments was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and
development activities increased by 15.9% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment due to
general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. Research facilities are located in the
U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with
additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.

In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2018, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, a partial
impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was calculated based on
updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a
decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. The Company continues to evaluate information
with respect to the development program and will monitor the remaining $0.9 billion intangible asset for further impairment. In addition, an impairment
charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of
XO1 Limited.

In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira

which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29
million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell.

Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down
of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains
and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty
income.

The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2018 was an unfavorable change of $1.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense of
$2.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. Additionally, 2018 included unrealized losses on securities of $0.2 billion and lower realized gains
of $0.4 billion related to investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent liability of
$0.2 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the Actelion and AMO acquisitions in 2018 as compared to 2017. The fiscal year of 2017 included a
gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables offset by an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin
pump business. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic
Pharmaceutical products. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 and primarily included the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED®
divestitures. Additionally, restructuring related expense in 2018 was $0.3 billion as compared to $0.4 billion 2017.

The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale

of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty
receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially
offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion
primarily

24

related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016.

Interest (Income) Expense:  Interest income was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a higher average interest rate and a benefit from net
investment hedging partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the period. Cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities totaled $19.7 billion at the end of 2018, and averaged $19.0 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities total of $18.3 billion and $30.1 billion average cash balance in 2017. The decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired
late in the fiscal second quarter of 2017.

Interest expense in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $32.5 billion in 2018

versus $30.9 billion in 2017. The total debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2017.

Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and

marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged
$30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.
Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total
debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion
was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the
capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.

Consumer Segment: In 2018, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.7%, versus 18.6% in 2017. The decrease in the
income before tax as a percent of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion in 2018 partially
offset by slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018, which included the divestitures of
NIZORAL® and RoC® were comparable to fiscal year of 2017. A gain of $0.3 billion was recognized from the divestiture of NIZORAL®.

In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a
percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED® in 2017. This was
partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional
spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations
in Venezuela.

Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2018, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.9% versus 30.6% in 2017. The increase in
the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to Actelion of $0.6 billion, favorable product mix and
slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales, a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion from
divestitures of certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. This was partially offset by higher amortization expense of $1.3 billion primarily related to
the Actelion acquisition, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion and an unrealized loss on securities of $0.2 billion as compared to

25

the prior year. Additionally, 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion
related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities.

In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax
as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and
development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally,
the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to
monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product
mix in 2017.

Medical Devices Segment: In 2018, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.3% versus 20.3% in 2017. The decrease
in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due higher litigation expense of $1.7 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 and
higher investments in the business in 2018. Additionally, 2018 had lower divestiture gains of approximately $0.3 billion as compared to divestiture gains in
2017. In 2018 the Company recorded a gain of $0.5 billion related to the LifeScan divestiture. This was partially offset by lower restructuring expense of
$0.2 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump
business.

In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax

as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher
litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in
new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the
divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery.

Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The Company has achieved
approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost saving in 2018 and is on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of $0.8 billion to $1.0
billion as outlined in the restructuring actions. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new
growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46
million is included in cost of products sold and $227 million is included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of approximately $2.5 billion have
been recorded since the restructuring was announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018.

In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the
Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product
portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic
collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.
Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the
Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022.
The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the
cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million, of which $59 million is included in
cost of products sold and $117 million is included in other (income) expense.

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.

Provision for Taxes on Income:  The worldwide effective income tax rate was 15.0% in 2018, 92.6% in 2017 and 16.5% in 2016. The 2018 effective tax
rate decreased by 77.6% as compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by a provisional tax charge of approximately $13.0 billion
as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which
increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4%. The Company also received a benefit in 2018 from a lower U.S. statutory tax rate vs. 2017 as well as favorable
adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge partially offset by unfavorable income tax mix and the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed
income (GILTI).

The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the

United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0
billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details
related to the TCJA.

26

The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of

changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin
pump business.

The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate

if enacted into law.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA and income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity & Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $18.1 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that
contributed to the $0.3 billion increase were approximately $22.2 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was partially offset by
$3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities, $18.5 billion net cash used by financing activities and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate
changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $1.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of
2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Cash flow from operations of $22.2 billion was the result of $15.3 billion of net earnings and $9.2 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments

for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, offset by $2.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses,
deferred tax provision and accounts receivable allowances, $3.9 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-
current assets and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $4.0 billion resulted from an increase
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in current and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2018 tax payment related to TCJA.
Investing activities use of $3.2 billion was for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.7 billion, the net purchase of investments primarily
marketable securities of $1.3 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $0.9 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Zarbee's) and other uses of $0.5 billion.
This was partially offset by $3.2 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestiture of LifeScan).

Financing activities use of $18.5 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $9.5 billion, $5.9 billion for the repurchase of common stock,
$3.9 billion for the net retirement of short and long-term debt and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $1.0 billion
of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.

On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to
purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or
discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase
program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program.

As of December 30, 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of
December 30, 2018, the net debt position was $10.8 billion as compared to the prior year of $16.3 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due
to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion in 2017. Additionally there was a higher cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of 2018. In 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial
paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company
anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and
access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company
monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed
a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see
Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into
forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions
primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of
the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $57 million.
Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s
forward contracts by $69 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying
transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.

27

The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $226 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on
future anticipated cash flows.

The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of
2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on
respective credit ratings and netting agreements.

The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of

fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if
interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the
unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.

Total borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 were $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement

of debt in 2018. In 2018, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.8 billion compared to net debt of $16.3 billion in 2017. Total
debt represented 33.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2018 and 36.5% of total capital in 2017. Shareholders’ equity per share at the
end of 2018 was $22.44 compared to $22.43 at year-end 2017.

A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other
significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2018 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for

Dividends
The Company increased its dividend in 2018 for the 56th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 compared with dividends of
$3.32 per share in 2017, and $3.15 per share in 2016.

Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures.
Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates
are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for
pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.

Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are
satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90
days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable
consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to
revenue which was adopted in 2018.

Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.

Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to

dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.

Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in
accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales
returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices
segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns
reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.

Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.

In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative
partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part
of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
disclosures on collaborations.

Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect

on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a
material financial statement impact.

Income Taxes:  Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between
U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold

and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.

The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts.
The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and
at current currency exchange rates.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.

Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability
claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals
in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.
The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable

and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.

See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.

31

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets:  The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash
flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may
change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.

Employee Benefit Plans:  The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination
indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,
mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.

Stock Based Compensation:  The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their
services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a
combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the
service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.
For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant.  The fair values for the sales and
earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the
award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value for the relative total
shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements
not yet adopted as of December 30, 2018.

Economic and Market Factors
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have
expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products
responsibly. For the period 2008 - 2018, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health
care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to
monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly
inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In
the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic
price increases.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to

as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U.  Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear
what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic
uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors
and changes in regulations.  However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 30, 2018, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less
than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies

in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2018 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately
$390 million and net income by approximately $100 million.

Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory

tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that
particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the
statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change
is enacted. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a
referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform

32

will take place on May 19th, 2019.  If the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January
2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the
Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax
Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results.

The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment

and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.

Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing

prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global
economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.

The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug

Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents,
seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar
versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those
products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further
information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial
and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue
and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and
other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the
possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of
judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be
affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has
not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are
numerous parties involved.

In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Common Stock
The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 15, 2019, there were 142,029 record
holders of Common Stock of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.

Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of
products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to
human health and well-being.

The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad
range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are
marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six
therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices
segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care
(divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the
professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.

New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related
amendments (new revenue standard) to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue
standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to
be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard has not had a material impact to either
reported Sales to customers or Net earnings. Additionally, the Company will continue to recognize revenue from product sales as goods are shipped or
delivered to the customer, as control of goods transfers at the same time.

In accordance with the new revenue standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings
and Balance Sheet was as follows:

The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, which decreased
beginning retained earnings by $47 million.

As part of the adoption of ASC 606 see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.

ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The amendments in this update supersede
the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require
equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net earnings. The standard amends financial reporting by
providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 that increased retained
earnings by $232 million net of tax and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously unrealized gains from equity investments. For
additional details see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting
entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated
entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third
party remains unaffected. As discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 the Company elected
an accounting policy to treat the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) under the deferred tax accounting model. As a result, the Company is
required to record an additional deferred tax liability related to the basis difference of these intra-entity asset transfers. The Company recorded net
adjustments including an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion, an increase to deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion,
related to the GILTI accounting policy election in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and a decrease
to retained earnings of approximately $0.4 billion. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

ASU 2017-01: Clarifying the Definition of a Business
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to
determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business
if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This
update was applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2017-07: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost
The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost
component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (NPBC). In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization.
The amendments in this update are required to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of
NPBC in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and prospectively, on and after the adoption date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of
NPBC in assets. As required by the transition provisions of this update, the following table shows the impact of the adoption on the respective line items in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for 2018 and the reclassifications to the 2017 and 2016 fiscal year Consolidated Statement of Earnings to
retroactively apply classification of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC:

ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. This update makes more financial and
nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies
assess effectiveness. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For additional
required disclosures see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Not Adopted as of December 30, 2018
ASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements
This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update
clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a
customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the
counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ASU 2018-16: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815)
This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate
permitted in the application of hedge accounting. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted if an entity has adopted ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact
of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax
Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments
and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to
recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This
update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ASU 2016-02: Leases
This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about
leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under
current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the new standard at its adoption date rather than at the earliest comparative
period

43

presented in the financial statements. The Company’s operating leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on
its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy
of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in
government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).

RRAs  are  collateralized  by  deposits  in  the  form  of  Government  Securities  and  Obligations  for  an  amount  not  less  than  102%  of  their  value.  The
Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that
the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that
collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date
of purchase are classified as marketable securities.

Investments
Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments
classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long
term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair
value through earnings, as required.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:

Building and building equipment

Land and leasehold improvements

Machinery and equipment

20 - 30 years

10 - 20 years

2 - 13 years

The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which
generally range from 3 to 8 years.

The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or

economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not
available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.

Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs
with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain
rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as
a reduction in sales.

Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through
the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.

Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to

dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.

Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product
recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s
accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to

44

customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition
when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost
exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company
infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of
annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales.

Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on
historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period
and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of
revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers.
For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.

Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1,090 million, $1,042 million and $974 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in
selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all
periods presented.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The
Company completed the annual impairment test for 2018 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth
quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying
project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the
intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by

economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.

Financial Instruments
As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1
having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for

undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the
Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness
of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial
Instruments.

Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted
periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when
those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not
record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.

As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The

Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed
the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.

45

Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments
made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts
capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.

The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize
drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are
exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by
one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and
royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due
from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the
performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these
collaborations is as follows:

Nature/Type of Collaboration
Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received

Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory
approval)*

Royalties received from collaborative partner

Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-
regulatory approval)

  Sales to customers

Cost of products sold

  Other income (expense), net

Research and development expense

Research and development payments to collaborative partner

  Research and development expense

Research and development payments received from collaborative partner

  Reduction of Research and development expense

*  Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.
For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.

The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO®, co-developed with

Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA®, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.

The Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX®, licensed from Genmab A/S.

Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018, 2017
and 2016, respectively.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax
regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.

The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold

and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.

In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company has elected to account for the GILTI tax under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts

recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred.

The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the
Company decides at a later date to

46

repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the
total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange
rates.

See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes.

Net Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common
stock using the treasury stock method.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives,
product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability
valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.

The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and

can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the
minimum amount is accrued.

Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year
consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in
2015, and will be the case again in 2020.

Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2018, 2017 and
2016 was $86 million, $94 million and $102 million, respectively.

Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion,

respectively.

Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are
eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are
recorded in earnings.

(1) The decrease was primarily attributable to the write-down of $1.1 billion related to the assets acquired in the acquisitions of Alios Biopharma Inc. (Alios) and XO1
Limited (XO1). Of the $1.1 billion, the Company recorded a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational
drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios. The impairment charge was
calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a
decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the
discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1. Additionally, $0.8 billion of IPR&D related to
ERLEADA™ was reclassified to definite lived intangible assets upon commercialization.

AMO acquisition acquired in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, within the Medical Devices segment.
(2) Goodwill of $1.0 billion is related to the divestiture of the LifeScan business. Goodwill of $0.3 billion is related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products
business, which was pending and classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2018.

The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 11 years and 22 years,
respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $4.4 billion, $3.0 billion and $1.2 billion before tax, for
the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five
succeeding years approximates $4.3 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.

6. Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency
interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are
designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment
hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These
forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings,
thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company early adopted ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities effective as of the beginning of fiscal second
quarter of 2018.

The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent

features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties
establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 30, 2018, the total amount of collateral paid
under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $182 million net. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The
Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at
least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for
receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 30, 2018, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign
exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.1 billion, $7.3 billion, and $0.5 billion respectively. As of
December 31, 2017, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest
rate swaps of $34.5 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.1 billion respectively.

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current

earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge
transaction.

The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these
contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings.  Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the
hedged transaction.

Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to
interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within
accumulated other comprehensive income.  The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot
method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and
when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.

During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022
to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in
order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.

As of December 30, 2018, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $195 million after-
tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the
amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate
contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change.
Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

The Company adopted ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities as of the
beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This ASU amends prior guidance to classify equity investments with readily determinable market values into different
categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through
net earnings. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 which
increased retained earnings by $232 million, net of tax, and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously net unrealized gains from
equity investments.

The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The
Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus
changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.

The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments as of December 30, 2018:

For equity investments without readily determinable market values, $54 million of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of
impairments. There were $67 million of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, changes in fair value reflected within other comprehensive income due to previously unrealized gains on
equity investments with readily determinable fair values net of tax was a net gain of $232 million.

Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the
inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the
lowest.

The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all
future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot
foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The
Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at
fair value.

The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.

Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day
Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019. Interest charged on borrowings
under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable
margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.

Throughout 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current
portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at the end of 2018, of which $2.6 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and
the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

Throughout 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current
portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.9 billion at the end of 2017, of which $2.3 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper
Program, $1.5 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with
statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The
2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4%.
(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code.
(3) Represents impact of adjustments to the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. This also includes a net tax benefit from the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding
taxes originally accrued as part of the provisional charge. This benefit reduced the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 11%. Further description is included below.
(4) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6% of the total effective tax rate.

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from
35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. This legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new
provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also included a provision for a tax on all previously
undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a
rate of 15.5% and all other earnings are taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest and these payments began in
2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year 2018 was approximately $8.2 billion.

In December 2017, the SEC provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the impacts of the TCJA, referred to as SAB 118. Under the guidance in

SAB 118, the income tax effects, which the accounting under ASC 740 is incomplete, are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate.
The reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a "measurement period", not to exceed one year, until the accounting is complete. The estimate is
also subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes
to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of approximately $13.0 billion which consisted primarily of the following

components:

•
•

•

•

a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017
a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits,
for repatriation of substantially all those earnings
a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on unrecognized tax
benefits
a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of TCJA. The Company recorded
net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $0.2 billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and
additional analysis by management as well as applying

58

interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge
was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign
earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the provisional charge in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total
net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to
elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon
reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). Through the third fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company had provisionally elected to treat GILTI as a period expense. Upon
further analysis of this new tax provision, the Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are
based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred. As a result of this election, the Company recorded a
deferred tax cost related to GILTI of approximately $1.4 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the
date of TCJA enactment.

As a result of the GILTI deferred tax charge and the other adjustments to the provisional amount, the Company recorded a total of $1.6 billion of
adjustments to the 2017 provisional charge increasing the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 9%.

During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding
taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring in the
fourth quarter 2018, and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings,
the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred
tax benefit of $1.9 billion. As this restructuring occurred after the TCJA enactment date, the benefit is not considered an adjustment to the provisional
amount recorded in 2017 under SAB118. This benefit with the SAB 118 adjustments has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s
effective tax rate reconciliation.

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of
Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard requires entities to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to transfer of assets, other than inventory,
within the consolidated entity. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net adjustment to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of the election to record GILTI on the deferred method, the Company recorded a GILTI deferred tax liability of
$1.7 billion related to the adoption provisions of ASU 2016-16 as an adjustment to retained earnings.

The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by the approximately $13 billion
provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate
by 3.4%. Additional drivers of the 2018 annual effective tax were:

•

•

•

•
•

the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate including the effects of tax elections which resulted in the acceleration of certain deductions
into the 2017 tax return. The impact of these accelerated deductions decreased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.7%
the impact of the adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA charge, including both SAB 118 adjustments and the internal restructuring, decreased
the effective tax rate by approximately 1.9%
GILTI tax which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.6%, which excludes the impact of the SAB 118 adjustment for the
adoption of the deferred method for GILTI
tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 1.5% and 2.0%, respectively
in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestiture of its LifeScan business (Note 20), which increased the Company annual
effective tax rate by approximately 0.8%

• more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017

The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the TCJA in the U.S. in December 2017.

The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3
percentage point increase to the effective tax rate.

The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of

changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin
pump business.

The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 billion at December 30, 2018, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company
conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has
completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this
audit during 2019. Final conclusion of the tax audit may result in an outcome that is different than the Company’s estimates and may result in a material
impact on the Company’s current and future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is concluded. In other major jurisdictions where the
Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be
completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months.  However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable
estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties

related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $53 million, $60 million
and $7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $503 million and $436 million in 2018 and 2017,
respectively.

10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover
most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their
dependents.

Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five
years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to adopt a
new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee
compensation over total years of service.

International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are

provided.

The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify

these plans in the future.

In 2018 and 2017 the Company used December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international

retirement and other benefit plans.

Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the following

Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active
employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using
a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.

Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the
plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan
participants at the time of the plan amendment.

The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The
resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. In the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining
service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability
cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest
costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for
this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit
obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results.

The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios
globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the
various asset class allocations by market.

The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in
accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.
For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that
are not funded.

In 2018, the Company contributed $679 million and $461 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.

The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded

Each pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In
determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax
regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives
to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority
of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed,
with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.

The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2018 and 2017 and target allocations for 2019 are as follows:

Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets
The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If
listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market
parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.

While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or

assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

Valuation Hierarchy
The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are
described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value

measurement.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.

•

•

•

•

•

Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the
custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the
fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares
outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.

Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on
which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models,
quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an
active market, they are classified as Level 2.

Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual
securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are
not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar
characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.

Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.
Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of
the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category
have a quoted market price.

66

•

•

Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying
investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are
government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor
other observable inputs for pricing.

Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and
commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1,
while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.

The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details.
Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for
additional details.

14. International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative
rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. Beginning in the
fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company accounted for operations in Argentina as highly inflationary. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the
local currency is the functional currency.

In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical
rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in
the operating results.

A rollforward of the changes during 2018, 2017 and 2016 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $265 million, $216 million and $289 million in 2018,

2017 and 2016, respectively.

15. Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018,
December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017:

The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1
million after-tax for 2018 and 2017, and $2 million for 2016.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options

was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.

16. Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $332 million,
$372 million and $330 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one

17. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At December 30, 2018, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares
granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to
650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to
April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 351 million at the end of 2018.

The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $978 million, $962 million and $878 million for 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $192 million, $275 million and
$256 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. An additional tax benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new
accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $827 million,
$798 million and $749 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.73 years, 1.76 years
and 1.09 years for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of

shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.

Stock Options
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the
average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.

The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. For 2018, 2017 and 2016 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and
a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The average fair value of options granted was $17.98, $13.38 and $10.01, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the
weighted average assumptions of:

6.2 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were 52,421 at an average price of $73.61 and 50,414 at an
average price of $65.77, respectively.

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance
share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance
share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a
three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted
operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary,
based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company
modified the restricted share units that are scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum
aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was
committed was not material to the Company’s overall financial position.

The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $119.67, $107.69 and $92.45 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, using the fair market
value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the
vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $613.7 million, $596.5 million and $587.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $120.64, $114.13 and $105.30 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, calculated using the

weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant.

The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value
of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.  The fair value
for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The
fair value of performance share units issued was $128.8 million, $132.5 million and $127.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

20. Business Combinations and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $0.9 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2018. These acquisitions were accounted for using
the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

The 2018 acquisitions primarily included: Zarbee’s, Inc., a privately held company that is a leader in naturally-based consumer healthcare products;

Medical Enterprises Distribution LLC, a privately held healthcare technology firm focused on surgical procedure innovation; BeneVir Biopharm, Inc.
(BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies and Orthotaxy, a privately-held
developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution.

The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable

intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.

On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese company focused on the marketing,
development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion,
which equates to approximately $2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was
completed on January 17, 2019, through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by
the Company for ¥5,900 per share. Upon completion of the tender offer and the related transactions, the Company acquired 89% of the outstanding shares.
The Company plans to acquire the remaining shares that were not tendered in the tender offer through a share consolidation under Japanese law during the
first half of 2019 and take appropriate actions to delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The acquisition will include the range of brands comprising
DR.CI:LABO, LABO LABO and GENOMER line of skincare products. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will
include it in the Consumer segment.

On February 13, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion in cash.

Additional contingent payments of up to$2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health is a
privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic
and therapeutic procedures. The closing is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the
end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will include it in the Medical Devices
segment.

During 2017 certain businesses were acquired for $35.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for

using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.

The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd, an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to:
cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets
medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction;
Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply
of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System
for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops,
manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools.

The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34.4 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1.1 billion has been identified as the value of IPR&D, primarily
associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the
projects.

During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to
$29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery
operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed
on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). In 2017 the Company held 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and had rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through
a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion. As a result of Idorsia raising additional capital in July 2018, the
Company currently holds 9.0% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 20.8% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal
amount of approximately $0.5 billion. The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of
Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount
within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. The
investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised
the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The
Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia

81

with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million. As of December 30, 2018, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the
credit facility. Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated,
innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of
Actelion’s specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary
therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need.

During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed

using the acquisition method. The following table presents the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date
with adjustments made through the second quarter of 2018:

(1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.

The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to

goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

*Includes $0.4 billion related to VALCHLOR®, one of the acquired products, which was divested in the fiscal second quarter of 2018.

The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the

patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. The in-process research
and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.

The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount

rate applied was 9%.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's
financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total sales and a net loss for Actelion from
the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, as if Actelion had been

acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in
depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost
savings or other effects of the planned integration of Actelion. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had
occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future.

The Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.8 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively,

which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold.

During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion, net of cash

acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase
price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion. The weighted average life of total amortizable
intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise
from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price
allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment.

Certain businesses were acquired for $4.5 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for

using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.

The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution

of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that
manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics; and
the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT® allergy spray outside the United States.

The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4.1 billion and has been assigned to identifiable

intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.

The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and
goodwill for $1.1 billion. The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years. The trademark asset
values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to
synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the
Consumer segment.

In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the

acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements.  In 2013, the Company settled the remaining
liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal
transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one
or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes
shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest.

With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2018, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with U.S. GAAP
standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did
not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

During 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in

2018 included: NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately
$1.2 billion. Additionally, in 2018, the Company accepted the binding

83

offer from Fortive Corporation to acquire its Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business for approximately $2.7 billion, subject to customary
adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2019. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.2
billion of inventory, $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment and $0.3 billion of goodwill. The Company will retain certain net receivables of
approximately $0.1 billion associated with the ASP business.

In 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services
providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products
within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. As of
December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.3 billion of inventory and $0.1 billion of property, plant and
equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the

divestiture of COMPEED® to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.3 billion.

During 2016, the Company divestitures included: the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business; certain
anesthetic products in Europe; and certain non-strategic Consumer brands. In 2016, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $0.6 billion.

21. Legal Proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial,
supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of
their business.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 30, 2018, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters
are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust
accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and
regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and
uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including
whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete;
proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.

In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal
proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.
However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.

PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in
these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible
to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-
20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to
defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional
amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the
Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can
represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns.
Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.

The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE®
Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL®; XARELTO®; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS® Baby Powder;
INVOKANA®; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of December 30, 2018, in the United States there were approximately 1,800
plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits

84

regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 10,500 with respect to the
PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System; 34,800 with respect to pelvic meshes; 13,400 with respect to RISPERDAL®; 25,600 with respect to XARELTO®;
13,000 with respect to body powders containing talc; 1,050 with respect to INVOKANA®; and 2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible
Composite Mesh.

In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip
Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of
pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been
filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy
reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with
eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy
reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had
revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing
to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does
not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip
patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec
Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The British Columbia order is currently the subject of an appeal. The Company continues to
receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the
costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR™ Hip-related product liability litigation.

Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the
PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United
States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed
in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed
on appeal and remanded for retrial, the second remains under appeal and the third is pending decision on post-trial motions in the district court. The
Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE® Acetabular Cup System. The Company is negotiating
settlements of these cases and the related costs are reflected in the Company’s accruals.

Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to
treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional
cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the costs associated with these
settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel,
Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In Australia, a trial of class action issues has been
completed and the parties are awaiting a decision. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with
Ethicon's pelvic mesh products.

Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made
against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual
property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products
and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial
defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in
any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,
require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most
significant of these matters are described below.

Medical Devices

In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI)
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE® ADVANCE and ACUVUE
OASYS® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandt’s United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently
upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the district court denied. In April 2016, the Court of
Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a
verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI. Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).
In February 2019, the CAFC affirmed the judgment in favor of JJVCI.

In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER™ and CYPHER SELECT™ stents made in the
United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and
attorneys’ fees. Although Johnson & Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After trial in January 2014, the district court
dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by
Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In
March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases. In April 2018, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial, and briefing in the district court
was completed in June 2018.

In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy
Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants. MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (’426);
8,273,132 (’132); 8,721,730 (’730) and 9,492,280 (’280) relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAMTM
Contact feature of the ATTUNE® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A claim construction hearing was held in
October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the ’132, ’730
and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the ’426 patent at issue
before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see
below). In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of
those claims. A hearing trial is scheduled for March 2019, and a decision in the proceeding is due by June 2019.

In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253;
8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017,
Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful
infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and
9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in

87

October 2017. The parties have entered joint stipulations such that only the ’735 patent, the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. Trial is
scheduled to begin in September 2019.

In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and Tissuegen, Inc. (collectively, UT) filed a lawsuit in the United States District

Sutures, MONOCRYL® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, PDS® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, STRATAFIX® POS® Antibacterial Sutures and STRATAFIX®
MONOCRYL®Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 directed to implantable polymer drug
releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent. UT is seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2018, Ethicon filed petitions with the
USPTO, seeking Inter Partes Review (IPR) of both asserted patents. Those petitions have been stayed by the USPTO pending a decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in an unrelated case.

Pharmaceutical

In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and
Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleged that JBI’s manufacture and sale of
DARZALEX® (daratumumab) willfully infringed MorphoSys’ United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys sought money
damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX® from Genmab. In January 2019, the district court granted summary judgment in
JBI and Genmab’s favor, invalidating the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit, and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the action.

In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company
(Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively
licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In
October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic
darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking
an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a
decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the court’s decision and the injunction is stayed pending the
appeal. In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending
the CJEU’s ruling on the issue.

In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacylics LLC and Abbvie Inc. (collectively, Abbvie), alleging that the manufacture and sale of
IMBRUVICA® infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,459,554. Janssen Biotech, Inc., which commercializes IMBRUVICA® jointly with Abbvie, intervened in the
action in November 2018. A trial is scheduled to begin in January 2021.

REMICADE® Related Cases

In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing
rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes
or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and
United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar. In August 2016, the district court
granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the
USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent.

In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to
make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. On July 30, 2018 the district court granted Celltrion’s motion for
summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States
Court of

88

Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions.

The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched.

Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)

The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or
undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson &
Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and
invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before
the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce
generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and
which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of
actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant
patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act,
is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.

ZYTIGA®

In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd.
(BTG) initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a number of generic companies (and
certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® 250mg before the expiration of
United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the ’438 patent). The generic companies include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New
York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and

In November 2018, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Qilu
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Qilu Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Qilu), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA® before
the expiration of the ’438 patent.

In December 2017, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Glenmark. In January 2018, Janssen dismissed its lawsuit against Sun after
it withdrew its ANDA. In April 2018, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex.

89

In October 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the ’438 patent. The court
held that the patent claims would be infringed if the patent were valid. Janssen appealed the court’s decision.

In November 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result,
several generic versions of ZYTIGA® have entered the market. Janssen has appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey, and the oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for March 2019.

The lawsuits against MSN and Qilu remain pending in the district courts. In each of these lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants
from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA® before the expiration of the ’438 patent.

Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the ’438 patent. In January 2018, the
USPTO issued decisions finding the ’438 patent claims unpatentable, and Janssen requested rehearing. In December 2018, the USPTO denied Janssen’s
request for rehearing of the IPR decisions. Janssen filed an appeal, which was consolidated with the above-mentioned appeal of the decision of the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

In October 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated two Notices of Application under Section 6 of the Patented
Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Teva Canada Limited (Teva) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Teva's filing
Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) and seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA® 250mg and ZYTIGA® 500mg before the
expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422. In June 2018, the parties entered into a settlement agreement.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS

Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive
regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with
government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is
possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation

Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were
named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in
these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state
government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed
to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by
Illinois, trial has been scheduled for March 2019. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and
Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation.

Opioids Litigation

Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies,
have been named in more than 1,600 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC®,
NUCYNTA® and NUCYNTA® ER. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state
court by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio,
Oklahoma and South Dakota. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government
agencies in the following states: Alabama; Arkansas; California; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland;
Massachusetts; Mississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon;
Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Utah; Virginia; Washington; West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government
of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. These actions allege a variety of
claims related to opioids marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts
and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the
plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. These cases are in early stages of litigation. In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson and
JPI were both served with a motion to consolidate 66 pending matters into a federal Multi District Litigation in the Southern District of Ohio. In December
2017, the MDL was approved in the Northern District of Ohio and there are over 1,400 cases that have been transferred to the MDL.

Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing
practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In
September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states
regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. The multi-state coalition served Johnson & Johnson and JPI with subpoenas as part of the
investigation. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have also received requests for information from the ranking minority member of the United States Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs regarding the sales, marketing, and educational strategies related to the promotion of opioids
use.

Other

In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy)
received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States
notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False
Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam
complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the
decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court, and fact
discovery is currently scheduled to close in September 2019. Additionally, DePuy filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court,
seeking review of the First Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition in April 2018.

Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of
several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently
of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR™ XL Hip device investigation with the State of Oregon. In December 2018, the Company, the
remaining states and the District of Columbia agreed to settle all of the investigations, and on January 22, 2019, the states and the Company filed consent
judgments resolving the matter.

In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of
the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson &
Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state
investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and
injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging
violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016 and by Mississippi in
October 2017. Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia.

In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD)
franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that
the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts® and Cellex® Systems during the
period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the
investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014.
Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that
occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce
certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests.

In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against
Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges
that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and
JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Trial is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a
denial of JJCI's motion for summary judgment.

In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with
regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act.

In January 2017, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice relating to
allegations concerning the sales and marketing practices of OLYSIO®. In December 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were served with a whistleblower
lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging the off-label promotion of OLYSIO® and additional products,
including NUCYNTA®, XARELTO®, LEVAQUIN® and REMICADE®.  At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the
lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee.  The United States

94

District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the claim in April 2018. In May 2018, the relator filed a notice of appeal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In November 2018, a second whistleblower lawsuit was unsealed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit is
substantially similar to the lawsuit under appeal but is brought in the name of the original relator. The federal and state governments have declined to
intervene in the second suit at this time.

In February 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking the
production of records pertaining to payments to any 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides financial assistance to Medicare patients. Multiple
pharmaceutical companies have publicly reported receipt of subpoenas and ongoing inquiries similar to this one and the one described below. The
government has represented that it will not be pursuing action against the company in this matter.

Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion US), received a subpoena in May 2016, with follow-up requests for documents from the United States
Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. The subpoena seeks the production of records pertaining to Actelion US’ payments to 501(c)(3)
charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In December 2018, the Company and the United States Department of
Justice agreed to a settlement in this matter.

In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act
investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE® or
SIMPONI ARIA®.

In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents
broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX®, OLYSIO®, REMICADE®, SIMPONI®, STELARA® and
ZYTIGA®. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies.

In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information
regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of
Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes, Inc. have produced documents in response to the
subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation.

In July 2018, Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False
Claims Act investigation concerning the pricing, quality, marketing and promotion of EvoTech ECR, Tyvek Peel Pouches, or Sterrad Cyclesure 24
biological indicators.

In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more
than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating
allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The United States Department of Justice
and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional preliminary inquiries about the inspection in Brazil, and Johnson &
Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. is cooperating with those requests.

From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to
ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.

GENERAL LITIGATION

In April 2016, a putative class action was filed against Johnson & Johnson, Johnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics Company, LLC and McNeil PPC, Inc.
(now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer, Inc.) in New Jersey Superior Court, Camden County on behalf of persons who reside in the state of New
Jersey who purchased various McNeil over-the-counter products from December 2008 through the present. The complaint alleges violations of the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. Following the grant of a motion to dismiss and the filing of an amended complaint, in May 2017, the court denied a motion to
dismiss the amended complaint. In December 2018, a settlement was reached and the matter has been dismissed.

associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek
injunctive relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States
District Court for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In July 2017, the district court granted Johnson
& Johnson's and JJCI’s motion to dismiss one of the cases. In September 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this

to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and
retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the
class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated
class action complaint in November 2015. In June 2016, the district court denied motions to dismiss filed by JJVCI and other defendants. Discovery is

ERISA, and state consumer protection claims. The complaint seeks equitable relief and damages. In November 2017, the case was ordered transferred to
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The LifeScan business was divested in October 2018 and Johnson & Johnson retained liability
that may result from these claims prior to the closing of the divestiture.

In September 2017, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in United

Clinical Research, Inc. (collectively “Actelion”) in United States District Court for the District of Maryland and United States District Court for the District
of Columbia.  The complaints allege that Actelion violated state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic
pharmaceutical manufacturers with samples of TRACLEER®.  TRACLEER® is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which imposes
restrictions on distribution of the product.  In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in
federal court in Maryland.

In December 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, Janssen)

Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost
of past and/or future remediation.

22. Restructuring
In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and
customers in today’s evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company has undertaken actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of
innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards.

In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46 million was included in cost of products sold and $227 million was
included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring has been announced. This restructuring
program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018.

On April 17, 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources

and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility
and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce
complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the global supply chain
restructuring strategic collaborations see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238
million, of which $59 million was included in cost of products sold and $117 million was included in other (income) expense. See the following table for
additional details on the restructuring programs.

In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that
will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, over the
4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.

**Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting the initiative and consulting expenses.

Although the Medical Devices restructuring program was completed in 2018, the Company expects that severance charges will continue beyond that date.
The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments has extended due to the planned release
of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply
Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional
amounts become probable and estimable. Approximately 2,375 individuals received separation payments since these restructuring announcements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 30, 2018 and
December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 30, 2018 including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
30, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

99

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the
preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting

determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and
communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness
of its internal controls over financial reporting.

Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 30, 2018, the Company’s

internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers

LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective

Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in
the "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in Item 8 of this Report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  During the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2018, there were no changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human

resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s
financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of its financial control environment.

4. The Company’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
the Company and have:

(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

5. The Company’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to

reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal

control over financial reporting.
