Overview

MGM  Resorts  International  is  a  Delaware  corporation  incorporated  in  1986  that  acts  largely  as  a  holding  company  and,  through  subsidiaries,  owns  and

operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company which completed its initial public offering in April 2016, is organized as
an  umbrella  partnership  REIT  (commonly  referred  to  as  an  UPREIT)  structure  in  which  substantially  all  of  its  assets  are  owned  by  and  substantially  all  of  its
businesses are conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Pursuant to a master lease agreement between a
subsidiary  of  the  Company  (the  “tenant”)  and  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  (the  “landlord”),  the  tenant  leases  the  real  estate  assets  of  The  Mirage,
Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM (which was branded as Monte Carlo prior to May 2018), Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM
Grand  Detroit,  Beau  Rivage,  Borgata,  and  MGM  National  Harbor  from  the  landlord.  See  Note  1  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for
information  regarding  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  which  we  consolidate  in  our  financial  statements,  and  Note  17  in  the  accompanying  consolidated
financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP.

We  believe  we  own  or  invest  in  several  of  the  finest  casino  resorts  in  the  world  and  we  continually  reinvest  in  our  resorts  to  maintain  our  competitive
advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other
new  features  and  amenities.  We  believe  we  operate  the  highest  quality  resorts  in  each  of  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Ensuring  our  resorts  are  the  premier
resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.

Business
Developments

In  August  2016,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata,  at  which  time  Borgata
became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us.  In December 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor and,
in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us.

In February 2018, we opened MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau, and in August 2018, we opened

MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts.

In July 2018, MGP completed its previously announced acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio
limited liability company that owns the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park from Milstein Entertainment LLC for a purchase
price of approximately $1.1 billion (“Northfield Acquisition”). Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate
of Hard Rock Café International (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager of the property.

In  September  2018,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  to  acquire  all  of  the  operating  assets  of  Northfield  (“Northfield  OpCo”)  from  MGP  for
approximately  $275  million,  subject  to  customary  purchase  price  adjustments.  Northfield  will  be  added  to  the  existing  master  lease  between  us  and  MGP.  The
transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.

In  December  2018,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  whereby  MGP  will  pay  us  consideration  of  approximately  $638  million  for  renovations
undertaken by us regarding the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing, the parties will enter into
an amendment to the existing master lease. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions.

In January 2019, we completed our previously announced acquisition of the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's race track and
casino ("Empire City") for consideration of approximately $864 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. Subsequently, MGP acquired
Empire City’s real property from us for fair value of consideration of

1

approximately $634 million. In connection with this transaction, we entered into an amendment to the existing master lease for our subsidiary to lease back the real
estate assets of Empire City from the landlord. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to
certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future.

Resort
Operations

General

Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on
the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments,
and repay debt financings.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of
major conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including
New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-
end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the
financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of our newly acquired Empire City Casino which operates 20 hours
a day, every day of the year. At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned
and  operated  by  us,  owned  by  us  but  managed  by  third  parties  for  a  fee,  or  leased  to  third  parties.  We  utilize  third-party  management  for  specific  expertise  in
operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

Las
Vegas
Strip
Resorts
and
Regional
Operations

Las
Vegas
Strip
Resorts.
At December 31, 2018, our Las Vegas Strip Resorts consisted of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas
(including  The  Signature),  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Delano  and  Four  Seasons),  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York  (including  the  Park),  Excalibur,  Park
MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas.

Regional
Operations.
At December 31, 2018, our Regional Operations consisted of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan;
Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s
County, Maryland; and MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other
non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and
customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn
affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-

limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

MGM
China

We  own  approximately  56%  of  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”),  the  Macau  company  that  owns  and
operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM
China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination
in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from
gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions
and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau,
S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos
or

2

gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require g overnment approval prior to commencing operations.

Corporate
and
Other

We  have  additional  business  activities  including  our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  and  certain  other  corporate  and  management  operations,

including MGP’s Northfield. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.

We  have  provided  certain  information  below  about  our  resorts  as  of  December  31,  2018.  Except  as  otherwise  indicated,  we  own  and  operate  the  resorts

incorporated herein by reference.

Customers
and
Competition

Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets
in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete
to  a  lesser  extent  with  state-sponsored  lotteries,  off-track  wagering,  card  parlors,  online  gambling  and  other  forms  of  legalized  gaming  in  the  United  States  and
internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business.” We
face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to
compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

•
•

•
•
•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
Constructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premier
dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;
Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Las
Vegas
Strip
Resorts
and
Regional
Operations

Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions,
trade associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and
value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during
mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or
near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos
elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently
expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las
Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where

location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.

MGM
China

The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations.
VIP  gaming  play  is  sourced  both  internally  and  externally.  Externally  sourced  VIP  gaming  play  is  obtained  through  external  gaming  promoters  who  offer  VIP
players  various  services,  such  as  extension  of  credit  as  well  as  complimentary  hotel,  food  and  beverage  services.  Gaming  promoters  are  compensated  through
payment  of  revenue-sharing  arrangements  and  rolling  chip  turnover-based  commissions.  In-house  VIP  players  also  typically  receive  a  commission  based  on  the
program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from
the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown
significantly  in  recent  years  and  we  believe  this  customer  base  represents  the  most  potential  for  sustainable  growth  in  the  future.  To  target  premium  main  floor
players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include
both table games and slots, to the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.

VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips

and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the

4

amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are bas ed on a percentage
of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the
table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, foo d and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. Gaming promoter
commissions  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  casino  revenue.  In-house  VIP  commissions  are  based  on  a  percentage  of  rolling  chip  turnover  and  are  recorded  as  a
reduction of cas ino revenue.

Our  key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additional
concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai
Strip.

We  encounter  competition  from  major  gaming  centers  located  in  other  areas  of  Asia  and  around  the  world,  including  Singapore,  Korea,  Australia,  New

Zealand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region.

Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in
newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also
advertise  through  our  regional  marketing  offices  located  in  major  U.S.  and  foreign  cities.  Our  direct  marketing  efforts  utilize  advanced  analytic  techniques  that
identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and
help build lasting customer relationships.

M life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both
gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused
customers,  in  addition  to  M  life  Rewards,  at  MGM  China.  The  structured  rewards  systems  based  on  member  value  and  tier  level  ensure  that  customers  can
progressively  access  the  full  range  of  services  that  the  resorts  provide.  Our  loyalty  programs  focus  on  building  a  rewarding  relationship  with  our  customers,
encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.

Strategy

We strive to be the recognized global leader in entertainment and hospitality, embracing innovation and diversity to inspire excellence. The quality of our
resorts  and  amenities  can  be  measured  by  our  success  in  winning  numerous  awards,  both  domestic  and  globally,  including  several  Four  and  Five  Diamond
designations  from  the  American  Automobile  Association  as  well  as  multiple  Four  and  Five  Star  designations  from  Forbes  Travel  Guide,  as  well  as  numerous
certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.

Our strategic objectives include:

•

•
•
•
•

cash flow, and margins;

Technology

Collectively  we  utilize  various  types  of  technology  to  maximize  revenue,  drive  efficiency  in  our  operations,  and  serve  our  customers  more  effectively.
Information Technology continues to automate operations in an effort to control costs related to operations and implement leading edge solutions for all major lines
of  business.  To  aid  this  process,  data  and  analytics  are  utilized  to  support  making  timely  and  accurate  business  decisions.  A  cloud  first  strategy  is  applied  when
possible  to  enable  our  technology  solution  delivery  and  speed  to  market.  We  are  also  focused  on  technology  to  enhance  the  guest  experience.  For  example,  our
eCommerce platform provides our guests and business partners a premier digital experience where they have the ability to create an

5

all-inclusive experience from accommodations to dining and entertainment with real time recommendations provided based on the preference.

Employees
and
Management

We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees are a primary success factor in the hospitality industry. Therefore, we invest heavily in
recruiting, training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible. We have numerous
programs,  both  at  the  corporate  and  business  unit  level,  designed  to  achieve  these  objectives.  We  believe  our  internal  development  programs,  such  as  the  MGM
Resorts University and various leadership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers.

Corporate
Social
Responsibility

We  believe  that  profitability  and  social  responsibility  can  be  linked  for  long-term  sustainability  and  profitability  in  furtherance  of  value  t  o  all  our
stakeholders  –  our  shareholders,  our  employees,  our  customers  and  our  communities.  Whether  we  refer  to  our  philosophy  as  Corporate  Social  Responsibility
(“CSR”) or associated Environmental and Social Governance (“ESG”) metrics, we strive to further two fundamental principles ‒ ethical, legal conduct in the way we
conduct our business, and integration of social responsibility as a distinct, strategic discipline into the fabric of our culture and sustainable business operations.

Through investment of many years of dedicated effort and resources, our evolving CSR approaches – grounded in prudent fiscal management and long-term

focused strategies – have advanced us beyond leadership in the gaming and hospitality industry to national recognition for our accomplishments.

Our  core  values  of  integrity,  inclusion,  teamwork  and  excellence  shape  our  character  and  culture,  the  way  we  do  business,  and  our  CSR  practices.    Four

strategic pillars guide our work.

Fostering
diversity
and
inclusion.
Our commitment to inclusion translates diversity as a fundamental paradigm of the 21st century global economy into long-
term human capital leadership, customer market expansion and competitive business advantage.  Inclusion is an important, multi-dimensional business imperative
that  attracts  top  talent;  drives  our  culture  of  respect  for  humanity;  leverages  the  broad  diversity  of  our  employees’  talents  to  drive  excellence  in  collaboration,
innovation and financial performance; fuels expansion of our customer markets and supply chain; and forges stronger ties with our communities around the world.

Investing
in
community.
  The communities in which we operate, and our employees live, work and care for their families, are cornerstones of our business
and our CSR system.  We create economic opportunity for local residents, collaborate to promote educational and develop skills of local workforces, engage local
businesses, and stimulate economic development in our communities.  We promote responsible gaming practices and tools, such as GameSense, that keep gaming
safe and entertaining.  Beyond our tax support of public education, infrastructure and services, we make philanthropic and development-related investments in long-
term institutions that benefit our employees and customers and elevate the quality of life and culture in our communities.

Caring
for
one
another.
    We  believe  caring  for  less  fortunate  community  neighbors  is  a  deep-rooted  part  of  our  culture,  and  our  actions  help  uplift  the
communities in which we operate, while simultaneously instilling employee pride and engagement in our business. Through three primary channels – our employee-
driven  MGM  Resorts  Foundation,  our  Employee  Volunteer  Program  and  our  Corporate  Giving  Program,  we  contribute  leadership,  funding  and  manpower  to  an
extensive  array  of  nonprofit  organizations  that  provide  services,  goods  and  resources  indispensable  to  our  communities’  well-being,  development  and
stability.    Significantly,  in  2018,  our  U.S.  employees  invested  more  than  123,000  hours  of  voluntary  service  with  community  non-profits  and  achieved  a  71%
participation level in giving through our MGM Resorts Foundation.

Environmental
sustainability.
 We  continue  to  gain  recognition  for  our  comprehensive  environmental  responsibility  initiatives  in  energy  and  water
conservation, recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green construction. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort in
Michigan were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, one of the largest international programs evaluating environmental sustainability in hotel
operations. We received certifications  at all of our domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Delano, Mandalay Bay, and MGM
Grand  Detroit  have  all  received  “Five  Green  Key,”  the  highest  possible  rating.  Many  major  travel  service  providers  recognize  the  Green  Key  designation  and
identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.

In  addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  environmental  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  and
operational efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara and Veer) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED ® Gold certifications from
the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the

6

standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-Mobile
Arena have all been awarded LEED ® Gold certification by the Council.

At  MGM  China,  we  incorporate  the  same  commitment  to  environmental  preservation.  Our  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  and
environmental  stewardship  have  resulted  in  MGM  China  being  included  in  the  Hang  Seng  Corporate  Sustainability  Benchmark  Index  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock
Exchange. MGM Cotai has achieved the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving (Macau) Association.

Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on strategic developments or
initiatives and repaying long-term debt or returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our
current resorts that will provide profitable returns.

We regularly  evaluate  possible  expansion and acquisition  opportunities  in domestic  and international  markets.  Opportunities  we evaluate  may include  the
ownership,  management  and  operation  of  gaming  and  other  entertainment  facilities  in  Nevada,  or  in  states  other  than  Nevada,  or  outside  of  the  United  States,
accessing new markets for sports and interactive, as well as online gaming. We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic
partnerships  and  international  expansion  opportunities.  We  feel  that  several  of  our  brands  are  well-suited  to  new  projects  in  both  gaming  and  non-gaming
developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

During 2018, we entered into an agreement with GVC Holdings PLC to form Roar Digital LLC, a world-class sports betting and online gaming platform in
the United States. The 50/50 venture will be capitalized with initial commitments of $100 million per partner. Under the agreement, the venture will benefit from the
economics of our existing race and sports books and online gaming operations and will have exclusive access to certain U.S. land-based and online sports betting,
online  real  money  and  free-to-play  casino  gaming,  major  tournament  and  online  poker,  and  other  similar  future  interactive  businesses.  The  commencement  of
operations is subject to gaming regulatory approvals.

Intellectual
Property

Our  principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Borgata,  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM  Grand,  MGM
Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various
classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and
development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and
services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification.  We believe that the name
recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so
long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development
and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.

Employees
and
Labor
Relations

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 55,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which approximately 6,000 and 3,000,
respectively,  support  the  Company’s  management  agreements  with  CityCenter.  In  addition,  we  had  approximately  11,000  employees  at  MGM  China.  We  had
collective  bargaining  agreements  with unions covering  approximately  39,000 of our employees  as of December  31, 2018. Collective  bargaining  agreements  with
three unions covering a substantial number of our employees in Las Vegas are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2019. We anticipate negotiations for successor
contracts with all three of those unions will begin in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, in our regional properties, new collective bargaining agreements will be
negotiated in 2019 at MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield. As of December 31, 2018, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and
the resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. In January 2019, we acquired operations in New York that employ approximately 1,000 employees,
a portion of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We anticipate several of these agreements will be negotiated in 2019. Also, in July 2018, MGP
acquired its property in Northfield, Ohio, which continues to be operated (on behalf of MGP) by an affiliate of Hard Rock International (STP), Inc. MGM expects to
acquire these operations in the first half of 2019, subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Ohio operation has employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements, several of which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019.

Regulation
and
Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject

to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located.

7

These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in
the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in dis ciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A  more  detailed  description  of  the  gaming  regulations  to  which  we  are  subject  is  contained  in  Exhibit  99.2  to  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  which

Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include,
but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes
(including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access
and use by persons with disabilities) , construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are
subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new
laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities
could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability  Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.
Under  various  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations,  an  owner  or  operator  of  real  property  may  be  held  liable  for  the  costs  of  removal  or  remediation  of
certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the
presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on us or the results of our operations.

Cautionary
Statement
Concerning
Forward-Looking
Statements

This  Form  10-K  and  our  2018  Annual  Report  to  Stockholders  contain  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  U.S.  Private  Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“expects,”  “will,”  “may”  and  similar  references  to  future  periods.  Examples  of  forward-looking  statements  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  statements  we  make
regarding expected market growth in Macau, our ability to generate significant cash flow and execute on ongoing and future projects, such as MGM 2020, and the
expected results of MGM 2020, amounts we will spend in capital expenditures and investments, the opening of strategic resort developments, the estimated costs and
components associated with those developments, our expectations with respect to future cash dividends on our common stock, dividends and distributions we will
receive from MGM China, the Operating Partnership or CityCenter and amounts projected to be realized as deferred tax assets. The foregoing is not a complete list
of all forward-looking statements we make.

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because
forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances
of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive,
market, and regulatory conditions and the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments to MGP, could adversely affect
our development options and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations;
current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make
planned expenditures;
restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness could significantly affect our ability to
operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity;
the fact that we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as fixed and percentage rent under the master lease, which could adversely
affect our ability to fund our operations and growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes;
significant  competition  we  face  with  respect  to  destination  travel  locations  generally  and  with  respect  to  our  peers  in  the  industries  in  which  we
compete;
the fact that our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations could adversely
affect our business;
the impact  on our business  of economic  and  market  conditions  in  the jurisdictions  in  which we operate  and in the  locations  in which  our customers
reside;
the possibility that we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of MGM 2020;

our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and certain other limitations;
a significant number of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to
lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position or results of operations;
financial, operational, regulatory or other potential challenges that may arise with respect to MGP, as our sole lessor for a significant portion of our
properties, may adversely impair our operations;
the  fact  that  MGP  has  adopted  a  policy  under  which  certain  transactions  with  us,  including  transactions  involving  consideration  in  excess  of  $25
million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures;
restrictions on our ability to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM
China;
the  ability  of  the  Macau  government  to  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating  MGM
Grand  Paradise,  exercise  its  redemption  right  with  respect  to  the  subconcession,  or  refuse  to  grant  MGM  Grand  Paradise  an  extension  of  the
subconcession in 2020;
the dependence of MGM Grand Paradise upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau;
changes to fiscal and tax policies;
our ability to recognize our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the variability of the valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax
asset;
extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business;
the concentration of a significant number of our major gaming resorts on the Las Vegas Strip;
the fact that we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect such gaming receivables;
the potential occurrence of impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets which could negatively affect future profits;
the susceptibility of leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or
acts of war or hostility;
the fact that co-investing in properties, including our investment in CityCenter, decreases our ability to manage risk;
the fact that future construction, development, or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks;
the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase
and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future;
the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business;
the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States and the impact of any potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or
other similar anti-corruption laws;
risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be brought against us;
the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements;
the sensitivity of our business to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results;
the potential that failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage to our reputation
and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data;
the potential reputational harm as a result of increased scrutiny related to our corporate social responsibility efforts;
the potential failure of future efforts to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, such as the
Empire City and Northfield acquisitions, or to divest some of our properties and other assets;
increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and
the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, which is a publicly traded
company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-K or our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by
law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-
looking statements.

You  should  also  be  aware  that  while  we  from  time  to  time  communicate  with  securities  analysts,  we  do  not  disclose  to  them  any  material  non-public
information, internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any
analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those
reports are not our responsibility and are not endorsed by us.

RISK
FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among
other things, the risks described below.

Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

•

•

Our
substantial
indebtedness
and
significant
financial
commitments,
including
the
fixed
component
of
our
rent
payments
to
MGP,
could
adversely
affect
our
operations
and
financial
results
and
impact
our
ability
to
satisfy
our
obligations
. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $15.3 billion of
principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, including $750 million of borrowings outstanding and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under
our  senior  secured  credit  facility,  and  $2.4  billion  and  $2.8  billion  of  debt  outstanding  under  the  MGM  China  and  the  Operating  Partnership  credit
facilities, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Operating Partnership had $1.9 billion of senior notes outstanding. Any increase in the
interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our
other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the
extent  MGM  China  or  the  Operating  Partnership  were  to  cease  to  produce  cash  flow  sufficient  to  service  their  indebtedness,  our  ability  to  make
additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:

•
•
•

•
•

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
limiting our  ability  to  borrow  additional  funds  for  working  capital  requirements,  capital  expenditures,  debt  service  requirements,
execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;
making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically
invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend an
aggregate  amount  of  at  least  1%  of  actual  adjusted  net  revenues  from  the  properties  subject  to  the  master  lease  on  capital  expenditures  at  those
properties). Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations,
funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in
Japan, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence
of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Current
and
future
economic,
capital
and
credit
market
conditions
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
service
or
refinance
our
indebtedness
and
to
make
planned
expenditures
 .  Our  ability  to  make  payments  on,  and  to  refinance,  our  indebtedness  and  to  fund  planned  or  committed  capital
expenditures  and  investments  depends  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow  in  the  future,  receive  distributions  from  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  or
subsidiaries,  including  CityCenter,  MGM  China  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  borrow  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  or  incur  new
indebtedness.  If  regional  and  national  economic  conditions  deteriorate  we  could  experience  decreased  revenues  from  our  operations  attributable  to
decreases  in  consumer  spending  levels  and  could  fail  to  generate  sufficient  cash  to  fund  our  liquidity  needs  or  fail  to  satisfy  the  financial  and  other
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or continue to
receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including CityCenter, MGM China and the Operating Partnership. We cannot
assure  you  that  future  borrowings  will  be  available  to  us  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  enable  us  to  pay  our
indebtedness  or  to  fund  our  other  liquidity  needs.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  be  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  in  the  future  to  borrow
additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us.

We  have  a  significant  amount  of  indebtedness  maturing  in  2020,  and  thereafter.  Our  ability  to  timely  refinance  and  replace  our  indebtedness  in  the
future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis,
we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no
assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on
terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

The
agreements
governing
our
senior
secured
credit
facility
and
other
senior
indebtedness
contain
restrictions
and
limitations
that
could
significantly
affect
our
ability
to
operate
our
business,
as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquid
ity,
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations
.
Covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;
incur additional debt;
incur liens on assets;
sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
enter into transactions with affiliates;
allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our  ability  to  comply  with  these  provisions  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.  The  breach  of  any  such  covenants  or  obligations  not
otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in
turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us
to satisfy certain  financial  covenants,  including a maximum  total  net leverage  ratio,  a maximum  first  lien  net leverage  ratio  and a minimum  interest
coverage ratio. Any default under our senior secured credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our
financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt.

In addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the Operating Partnership is a
borrower  under  its  senior  secured  credit  facility,  all  of  which  contain  covenants  that  restrict  the  respective  borrower’s  ability  to  engage  in  certain
transactions. In particular, these credit agreements require MGM China and the Operating Partnership to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose
certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise).
These  restrictions  include,  among  other  things,  limitations  on  their  ability  to  pay  dividends  or  distributions  to  us,  incur  additional  debt,  make
investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.

We
are
required
to
pay
a
significant
portion
of
our
cash
flows
as
fixed
and
percentage
rent
under
the
master
lease,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
fund
our
operations
and
growth,
service
our
indebtedness
and
limit
our
ability
to
react
to
competitive
and
economic
changes
. For the third
lease year which commenced on April 1, 2018, we were required to make annual rent payments of $770 million under the master lease. The master
lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent in the second through sixth years and the possibility for additional 2% increases
thereafter subject to the tenant meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every five
years thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period. As a result, our ability to fund our
own operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may
be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the master lease may:

•
•
•

•
•
•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;
require  us  to  dedicate  a  substantial  portion  of  our  cash  flow  from  operations  to  making  rent  payments,  thereby  reducing  the
availability  of  our  cash  flow  to  fund  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  development  projects  and  other  general  corporate
purposes;
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and
cause us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or
otherwise default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from MGP under the master lease are effectively cross-
collateralized as a result of the master lease being a single unitary lease.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
we
compete,
and
failure
to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
. The
hotel, resort and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel,
resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room
capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also
expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the
domestic  regional  markets  in  which  we  operate,  all  of  which  could  attract  our  customers.  Also,  the  growth  of  gaming  in  areas  outside  Las  Vegas,
including California, has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. While we believe our principal competitors are
major  gaming  and  hospitality  resorts  with  well-established  and  recognized  brands,  we  also  compete  against  smaller  hotel  offerings  and  peer-to-peer
inventory  sources,  which  allow  travelers  to  book  short-term  rentals  of  homes  and  apartments  from  owners.  We  expect  that  we  will  continue  to  face
increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel
industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain business.

In  addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gaming
establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located
elsewhere in or near Asia, certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may
legalize  casino  gaming  (or  online  gaming)  in  the  future  (including,  for  example,  a  recent  proposal  by  China  to  allow  gambling  on  Hainan  Island).
Furthermore,  currently  MGM  Grand  Paradise  holds  one  of  only  six  gaming  concessions  authorized  by  the  Macau  government  to  operate  casinos  in
Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors  to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current
concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition.

Most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses.
Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new
gaming  operations  may  be  restricted  to  specific  locations  and  we  expect  that  there  will  be  intense  competition  for  any  attractive  new  opportunities
(which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have also
legalized  forms  of  online  gaming  and  other  jurisdictions,  including  Illinois,  have  legalized  video  gaming  terminals.  Additionally,  in  May  2018,  the
United States Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited single-game gambling in most states, raising the potential
for increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it.  The expansion of online gaming, sports betting, and
other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino
resorts.

In  addition  to  competition  with  other  hotels,  resorts  and  casinos,  we  compete  with  destination  travel  locations  outside  of  the  markets  in  which  we
operate. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
results
of
operations
 .  Our  ownership  and  operation  of  gaming  facilities  is  subject  to  extensive  regulation  by  the  countries,  states  and
provinces in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,
financial  stability  and  character  of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gaming
operations.  As  such,  our  gaming  regulators  can  require  us  to  disassociate  ourselves  from  suppliers  or  business  partners  found  unsuitable  by  the
regulators or, alternatively,  cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign
unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The
regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations. For example, recently the U.S. Department of Justice reversed a 2011 opinion that had concluded that the Wire Act of 1961 was limited
to gaming relating to sports; the Department of Justice concluded instead that certain of the Wire Act’s provisions apply also to other forms of wagering
activity. This may impact our ability to engage in online gaming in the future. In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to
possible  increase  at any  time  by various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  legislatures  and officials.  Increases  in gaming  taxation  could also adversely
affect  our  results.  For  a  summary  of  gaming  and  other  regulations  that  affect  our  business,  see  “Regulation  and  Licensing”  and  Exhibit  99.2  to  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

13

Further,  our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatory
authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that
person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the
conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private
issuances of securities and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.

In Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on
the interpretation of these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the
future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau are
subject  to  administrative  review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  China  will  be  able  to  obtain  all
necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to
the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general.
These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking,
employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal,
state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible
for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and
regulations could be enacted. For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places,
schools  and  casinos.  In  addition,  effective  January  1,  2019,  smoking  in  casinos  in  Macau,  including  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai,  will  only  be
permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in
other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial
performance.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-
money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970,
commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act,” which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency
transactions  in  excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  the  currency
transaction.  We  are  also  required  to  report  certain  suspicious  activity  where  we  know,  suspect  or  have  reason  to  suspect  transactions,  among  other
things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful
purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention.
Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be
interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  and  regulations  could  be  enacted.  Any  violations  of  the  anti-money  laundering  laws,  including  the
Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside
.
Our  business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and
business development. Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may
cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in
discretionary  consumer  spending  or  consumer  preferences  could  be  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  increased  cost  of  travel,  an  unstable  job  market,
perceived  or  actual  disposable  consumer  income  and  wealth,  outbreaks  of  contagious  diseases  or  fears  of  war  and  acts  of  terrorism  or  other  acts  of
violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in
recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and
timely react to

14

these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas in particular may be
affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California
in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to
cause a reduction  i n visitation  to  our  resorts,  which  would adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  For example,  the  prior  recession  and  downturn  in
consumer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results of operations.

In addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai from mainland China, general economic and
market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel
and  currency  conversion  or  movements,  including  market  impacts  resulting  from  China’s  recent  anti-corruption  campaign  and  related  tightening  of
liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and
other  ATM  limits  on  the  withdrawal  of  patacas  imposed  by  the  government),  could  disrupt  the  number  of  visitors  from  mainland  China  and/or  the
amounts they are willing to spend in the casino. Most recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented new
facial  recognition  technology  on  ATM  machines  in  Macau  to  strictly  enforce  the  “know  you  r
 customer”  regulations  for  mainland  Chinese  bank
cardholders and in November 2017 new rules were adopted to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. It is
unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have
had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland
China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.

Furthermore,  our  operations  in  Macau  may  be  impacted  by  competition  for  limited  labor  resources.  Our  success  in  Macau  will  be  impacted  by  our
ability to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such
competition will grow in light of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resorts, certain
Macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire
Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to
increase.  Finally,  because  additional  casino  projects  have  commenced  operations  and  other  projects  are  under  construction,  existing  transportation
infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to
meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results
of operations at our development in Cotai, Macau, could be negatively impacted.

We
may
not
realize
all
of
the
anticipated
benefits
of
our
MGM
2020
Plan.
We have undertaken an initiative to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and
further position us for growth. While we believe these initiatives will result in approximately $200 million of annual Adjusted EBITDA benefit by the
end  of  2020  and  an  additional  $100  million  by  the  end  of  2021,  our  efforts  may  fail  to  achieve  expected  results.  Our  MGM  2020  Plan  is  subject  to
numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual Adjusted EBITDA benefit may differ materially from what we
anticipate.

Our
ability
to
pay
ongoing
regular
dividends
to
our
stockholders
is
subject
to
the
discretion
of
our
board
of
directors
and
may
be
limited
by
our
holding
company
structure,
existing
and
future
debt
agreements
entered
into
by
us
or
our
subsidiaries
and
state
law
requirements.
We intend to pay ongoing
regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of
dividends  or  discontinue  the  payment  of  dividends  entirely.  In  addition,  our  ability  to  pay  dividends  is  restricted  by  certain  covenants  in  our  credit
agreement,  and  because  we  are  a  holding  company  with  no  material  direct  operations,  we  are  dependent  on  receiving  cash  from  our  operating
subsidiaries  to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.  We  expect  our  subsidiaries  will  continue  to
generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock; however, their ability to generate funds will be
subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds
available  to  us,  and  compliance  with  covenants  and  financial  ratios  related  to  existing  or  future  agreements  governing  any  indebtedness  at  such
subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporate
chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various
limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the
payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

A

a
material
adverse
effect
on

business,
financial
position
or
results

operations.
 We lease eleven of our destination resorts and The Park from a subsidiary of MGP pursuant to the master lease. The
master lease has a term of ten

•

•

•

15

years with up to four additional five-year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The master lease is commonly known as a triple-net
lease. Accor dingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required
in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied o n or with respect to the leased properties
(other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased
properties and the business conducted on the leased pr operties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the
benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to MGP as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities
s hould prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations, or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular
property, we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if we decided to cease operations at those
locations  unless  we  are  able  to  transfer  the  rights  with  respect  to  a  particular  property  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  master  lease.  Our
ability  to transfer  our obligations  under  the master  lease  to  a  third-party  with  respect  to  individual  properties,  should  we decide  to  withdraw  from  a
particular location, is limited to non-Las Vegas properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties, and is subject to identifying a willing
third-party who m eets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the master lease. We may be unable to find an appropriate transferee willing   to
assume the obligations under the master lease with respect to any such property. In addition, we could incur special charges relating to the closing of
such facilities including sublease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of ope rations. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs
described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent
in leases that now place t hese risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation.

Any
financial,
operational,
regulatory
or
other
potential
challenges
that
may
arise
with
respect
to
MGP,
as
our
sole
lessor
for
a
significant
portion
of
our
properties,
may
adversely
impair
our
operations
. We lease a substantial number of the properties that we operate and manage, which represents a
significant portion of our operations, from MGP under the master lease. If MGP has financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be
no assurance that MGP will be able to comply with its obligations under the master lease or its other agreements with us. Failure on the part of MGP to
fulfill its commitments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Chairman of MGP. In addition, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of MGP and William J. Hornbuckle, and John M. McManus,
members of our senior management, are also directors of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational
documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest
extent  permitted  by  law,  these  overlapping  positions  could  nonetheless  create,  or  appear  to  create,  potential  conflicts  of  interest  when  our  or  MGP's
management  and  directors  pursue  the  same  corporate  opportunities,  such  as  potential  acquisition  targets,  or  face  decisions  that  could  have  different
implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and MGP
(or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and MGP, such as under the master
lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial  or other adverse arrangements with each other in the
future.

Despite
our
ability
to
exercise
control
over
the
affairs
of
MGP
as
a
result
of
our
ownership
of
the
single
outstanding
Class
B
share
of
MGP,
MGP
has
adopted
a
policy
under
which
certain
transactions
with
us,
including
transactions
involving
consideration
in
excess
of
$25
million,
must
be
approved
in
accordance
with
certain
specified
procedures,
which
could
affect
our
ability
to
execute
our
operational
and
strategic
objectives.

We own the single
outstanding Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or
losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the
voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership
of  the  combined  economic  interests  in  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership  does  not  fall  below  30%.  We,  therefore,  have  the  ability  to  exercise
significant control over MGP’s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval.

MGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other
than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’s
board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) approved by a majority
of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined
in accordance with the NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors

subsidiaries,  on  the  other  hand  (any  such  tra  nsaction  (other  than  the  exercise  of  rights  by  us  or  any  of  our  affiliates  (other  than  MGP  and  its

be per mitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliate s).

As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to
us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a
conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The
failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

We
have

have
any
interest
or
involvement
in
gaming
businesses
in
China,
Macau,
Hong
Kong
and
Taiwan,
other
than
through
MGM
China
. In connection with the initial public offering of MGM China, the holding company that indirectly owns and operates MGM Macau, we entered
into a Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM China and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms. Ho”) pursuant to which we are restricted
from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through
MGM China.  While  gaming  is  currently  prohibited  in  China,  Hong Kong  and  Taiwan,  if  it  is  legalized  in  the  future  our  ability  to  compete  in  these
locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) March 31, 2020, (ii) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong Limited or (iii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.

The
Macau
government
can
terminate
MGM
Grand
Paradise’s
subconcession
under
certain
circumstances
without
compensating
MGM
Grand
Paradise
, exercise
its
redemption
right
with
respect
to
the
subconcession,
or
refuse
to
grant
MGM
Grand
Paradise
an
extension
of
the
subconcession
in
2020
, any
of
which
would
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business
, financial
condition
, results
of
operations
and
cash
flows
. The Macau
government  has  the  right  to  unilaterally  terminate  the  subconcession  in  the  event  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with
applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  the  subconcession  contract.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  has  the  opportunity  to
remedy  any  such  non-compliance  with  its  fundamental  obligations  under  the  subconcession  contract  within  a  period  to  be  stipulated  by  the  Macau
government.  Upon  such  termination,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  area  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  would  be  transferred
automatically  to  the  Macau  government  without  compensation  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  and  we  would  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  these
operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies
the requirements of the Macau government.

Furthermore, under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government
might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these
laws and regulations  would not adversely  affect our ability  to construct  or operate  our Macau businesses. If any disagreement  arises between MGM
Grand  Paradise  and  the  Macau  government  regarding  the  interpretation  of,  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  compliance  with,  a  provision  of  the
subconcession  contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.  During  any
consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau
government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon
the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in
Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In  addition,  the  subconcession  contract  expires  on  March  31,  2020.  Unless  the  subconcession  is  extended,  or  legislation  with  regard  to  reversion  of
casino  premises  is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  the
Macau government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning on
April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau
government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or
indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention
and  exhibition  facilities,  during  the  taxable  year  prior  to  the  redemption,  before  deducting  interest,  depreciation  and  amortization,  multiplied  by  the
number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend the
subconcession  contract  on  terms  favorable  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  at  all.  We  also  cannot  assure  you  that  if  the  subconcession  is  redeemed,  the
compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
. Gaming promoters, who promote
gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Maca u. With
the rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated
by  licensed  gaming  promoters,  the  competition  for  relationships  with  gaming  promoters  has  increased.  Wh  ile MGM Grand Paradise is undertaking
initiatives  to  strengthen  relationships  with  gaming  promoters,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  it  will  be  able  to  maintain,  or  grow,  relationships  with
gaming  promoters.  In  addition,  continued  reductions  in,  and  new  reg  ulations  governing,  the  gaming  promoter  segment  may  result  in  the  closure  of
additional  VIP  rooms  in  Macau,  including  VIP  rooms  at  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai.  If  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  unable  to  maintain  or  grow
relationships with gaming promoters, or if gamin g promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as a
result  of  recent  market  conditions  in  Macau,  gaming  promoters  encounter  difficulties  attracting  patrons  to  come  to  Macau  or  experience  decreased
liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM Grand Paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if
existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai are closed there can be no assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be ab le to locate acceptable
gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all.

In addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance
with gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming
promoters  with  whom  MGM Grand  Paradise  is  or  becomes  associated  will  meet  the  high  standards  insisted  upon. If  a  gaming  promoter  falls  below
MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  with
authority over our operations.

We also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the
recoverability of these loans.

We
are
subject
to
taxation
by
various
governments
and
agencies
and
the
rate
of
taxation
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
could
change
in
the
future.
We are subject to tax by various governments and agencies, both in the U.S. and in Macau. Changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxes
we owe and the time when income is subject to taxation, the Macau income tax exemption or the imposition of foreign withholding taxes could increase
our overall rate of taxation. Any of these changes could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The
future
recognition
of
our
foreign
tax
credit
deferred
tax
asset
is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
such
deferred
tax
asset
may
change
materially
in
future
periods.
 We  currently  have  significant  deferred  tax  assets  resulting  from  foreign  tax  credit
carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses
to the extent of U.S. taxable income. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the
extent  that  we  determine  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  such  asset  will  be  recovered.  This  evaluation  is  based  on  all  available  evidence,  including
assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and our interpretations of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) based upon guidance
issued to date. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions
could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such
change.

Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
of
operations
.  Certain  of  our  casino  properties  are  located  in  areas  that  may  be  subject  to  extreme  weather  conditions,  including,  but  not  limited  to,
hurricanes in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,
and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other
cause of water shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely
affect  our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Although  we  maintain  both  property  and  business  interruption  insurance  coverage  for  certain  extreme
weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business
interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme
weather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our
affected  properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period,  which  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and cash flows.

Because
a
significant
number
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
that
is
more
geographically
diversified
. Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our
business may be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the
impact of any events that disrupt air

18

•

•

•

•

travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely
on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact
the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vega s and Southern California, where a large
number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit
our facilities.

We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
 .  We  conduct  a  portion  of  our  gaming
activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers
than slot players,  and high-end  players typically  are  issued more markers  than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts.  High-end gaming is more
volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact
on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level
of  play  and  financial  resources  warrant,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  an  extension  of  credit.  In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  extends  credit  to
certain  gaming  promoters  and  those  promoters  can  extend  credit  to  their  customers.  Uncollectible  receivables  from  high-end  customers  and  gaming
promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

While gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on
gaming  debts  are  enforceable  in  all  states  under  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  other  jurisdictions  may  determine  that
enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the
U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of
many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the
extent MGM China gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will
be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China
may  encounter  forums  that  will  refuse  to  enforce  such  debts.  Moreover,  under  applicable  law,  MGM  China  remains  obligated  to  pay  taxes  on
uncollectible winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on
our operating results.

We
may
incur
impairments
to
goodwill,
indefinite-lived
intangible
assets,
or
long-lived
assets
which
could
negatively
affect
our
future
profits
 . We
review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative
guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have
resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or
write-downs may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Leisure
and
business
travel
, especially
travel
by
air
, are
particularly
susceptible
to
global
geopolitical
events
, such
as
terrorist
attacks,
other
acts
of
violence
or
acts
of
war
or
hostility
. We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air to
our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived
threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, although we have
been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from
war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
. In addition to acquiring or developing
hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,
as  a  co-investor.  Co-investors  often  have  shared  control  over  the  operation  of  the  property.  Therefore,  the  operation  of  such  properties  is  subject  to
inherent  risk  due  to  the  shared  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  need  to  reach  agreements  on  material  matters.  In  addition,  investments  with  other
investors  may  involve  risks  such  as  the  possibility  that  the  co-investor  might  become  bankrupt  or  not  have  the  financial  resources  to  meet  its
obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action
contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts
owned  by  such  entities  to  additional  risk.  Further,  we  may  be  unable  to  take  action  without  the  approval  of  our  co-investors.  Alternatively,  our  co-
investors could take actions

19

binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabil ities.

For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business
and its ability to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future
funding requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’s
indebtedness subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur
additional  indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  into
transactions with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
all  or  substantially  all  of  its  assets.  The  CityCenter  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require  CityCenter  to  maintain  a
maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet this
test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

Any
of
our
future
construction,
development
or
expansion
projects
will
be
subject
to
significant
development
and
construction
risks,
which
could
have
a
material
adverse
impact
on
related
project
timetables,
costs
and
our
ability
to
complete
the
projects
.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including:

•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
changes to plans and specifications;
engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;
delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,
residential, real estate development or construction projects;
labor disputes or work stoppages;
availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;
disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
personal injuries to workers and other persons;
environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
weather interferences or delays;
fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

The  occurrence  of  any  of  these  development  and  construction  risks  could  increase  the  total  costs,  delay  or  prevent  the  construction,  development,
expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals
associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet
those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or
incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties,
including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.

•

Our
insurance
coverage
may
not
be
adequate
to
cover
all
possible
losses
that
our
properties
could
suffer.
In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
may
increase
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
. Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating
properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policy
has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of
rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major
casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations
or  conventions  due  to  fear  of  terrorism  or  other  acts  of  violence,  loss  of  electrical  power  due  to  catastrophic  events,  rolling  blackouts  or  otherwise,
deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal

20

•

•

•

damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In  addition  to  the  damage  caused  to  our  properties  by  a  casualty  loss,  we may  suffer  business  disruption  as  a  result  of  these  events  or  be  subject  to
claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may
not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event.

We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may
need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any
failure
to
protect
our
trademarks
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
value
of
our
brand
names
and
adversely
affect
our
business
 .  The
development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our
success.  While  our  business  as  a  whole  is  not  substantially  dependent  on  any  one  trademark  or  combination  of  several  of  our  trademarks  or  other
intellectual  property,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.  We  file
applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some
foreign  countries  do  not  protect  proprietary  rights  to  as  great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  our
intellectual  property  is  difficult.  Litigation  may  be  necessary  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights  or  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  the
proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps
we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others.
The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or
goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

We
are
subject
to
risks
associated
with
doing
business
outside
of
the
United
States
. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that
are  inherent  in  conducting  business  under  non-United  States  laws,  regulations  and  customs.  In  particular,  the  risks  associated  with  the  operation  of
MGM China or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
changes in non-United States government programs;
possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;
different labor regulations;
changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
outbreaks of diseases or epidemics;
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We  are  also  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks,  including  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  If  the  United  States  dollar
strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the
currencies of other such countries will decrease.

Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
. A significant portion
of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-
border  business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.  We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  Corrupt
Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws,  which  generally  prohibit  companies  and  their  intermediaries  from  making  improper
payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply
with  these  laws,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  our  internal  policies  and  procedures  will  always  protect  us  from  violations  of  these  laws,  despite  our
commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and
civil  sanctions  as  well  as  other  penalties  against  us,  and  the  SEC  and  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  continue  to  vigorously  pursue  enforcement  of  the
FCPA. The occurrence or allegation

of t hese types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

We
face
risks
related
to
pending
claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
. Claims have been brought against us and our
subsidiaries  in  various  legal  proceedings,  and  additional  legal  and  tax  claims  arise  from  time  to  time.  We  may  not  be  successful  in  the  defense  or
prosecution  of  our  current  or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,
financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  reputation.  Please  see  the  further  discussion  in  “Legal  Proceedings”  and  Note  11  in  the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
Work
stoppages
 and  other  labor  problems  could  negatively
affect our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 39,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  In  January  2019,  we  acquired  operations  in  New  York  that  employ  approximately  1,000  employees,  a  portion  of  which  are  covered  by
collective bargaining agreements. We anticipate several of these agreements will be negotiated in 2019. Also, in July 2018, MGP acquired its property
in Northfield, Ohio, which continues to be operated (on behalf of MGP) by an affiliate of Hard Rock International (STP), Inc. MGM expects to acquire
these  operations  in  the  first  half  of  2019,  subject  to  certain  customary  closing  conditions.    The  Ohio  operation  has  employees  covered  by  collective
bargaining agreements, several of which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest,
strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adverse
publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage
and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To
the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems. Furthermore, we may
have,  or  acquire  in  the  future,  multi-employer  plans  that  are  classified  as  “endangered,”  “seriously  endangered,”  or  “critical”  status.  For  instance,
Borgata’s  most  significant  plan  is  the  Legacy  Plan  of  the  National  Retirement  Fund  (which  spun-off  into  a  newly  established  fund  as  of  January  1,
2018), which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve
their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take
the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw
from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time
(or  over  a  period  of  time)  that  would  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors  at  the  time  of  (and  after)  withdrawal.  Any  such  additional  costs  may  be
significant.

Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
 .  We  are  a  large  consumer  of
electricity  and  other  energy  and,  therefore,  higher  energy  prices  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  Accordingly,  increases  in
energy costs may have a negative  impact on our operating results.  Additionally, higher electricity  and gasoline prices that affect  our customers  may
result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

The
failure
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
computer
systems
and
customer
information
could
result
in
damage
to
our
reputation
and/or
subject
us
to
fines,
payment
of
damages,
lawsuits
and
restrictions
on
our
use
of
data.
 We  collect  and  process  information  relating  to  our  employees,  guests,  and
others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy
laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to
evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt
new  or  additional  laws  and  regulations  concerning  privacy,  data  retention,  data  transfer,  and  data  protection.  For  example,  the  European  Union  has
adopted  a  data  protection  regulation  known  as  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  which  became  fully  enforceable  in  May  2018,  that  includes
operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California has enacted a new privacy law, known
as  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act  of  2018,  which  takes  effect  in  2020  and  provides  some  of  the  strongest  privacy  requirements  in  the  United
States.

Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products,
properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-
compliance  by  third  parties  engaged  by  us),  including  accidental  loss,  inadvertent  disclosure,  unapproved  dissemination  or  a  breach  of  security  on
systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or
transfer  of  data.  We  rely  on  proprietary  and  commercially  available  systems,  software,  and  tools  to  provide  security  for  processing  of  customer  and
employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated
regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware,
viruses,  hacking  and  phishing  attacks  by  third  parties.  In  addition,  while  we  maintain  cyber  risk  insurance  to  assist  in  the  cost  of  recovery  from  a
significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .

22

•

•

•

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintai n information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability
of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the
results  of  operations.  For  instan  ce,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  criminal  cyber  security  attacks  against  companies  where  customer  and  company
information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our thir
d-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers face
risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significant theft,
loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation,
cause  a  material  disruption  to  our  operations,  a  nd  result  in  remediation  expenses,  regulatory  penalties  and  litigation  by  customers  and  other  parties
whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We
are
subject
to
risks
related
to
corporate
social
responsibility
and
reputation.
 Many  factors  influence  our reputation  and  the value  of our  brands
including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business
faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if
we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change,
workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and
retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and cash flows.

We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divest
some
of
our
properties
and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
 .  We  intend  to  consider  strategic  and  complementary  acquisitions  and
investments  in  other  businesses,  properties  or  other  assets.  Furthermore,  we  may  pursue  any  of  these  opportunities  in  alliance  with  third  parties,
including  MGP. Acquisitions  and investments  in businesses,  properties  or assets, as well as these  alliances,  are  subject to risks that  could affect  our
business, including risks related to:

•
•
•
•
•
•

spending cash and incurring debt;
assuming contingent liabilities;
unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
retaining key employees; and
consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will
actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new
assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss or customer or other
business relationships and the diversion of management attention.

In addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our
business,  are  in  markets  which  may  not  benefit  us  as  much  as  other  markets  or  could  be  sold  at  significant  premiums.  From  time  to  time,  we  may
attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.

If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities  raise a
significant  amount  of  revenue  through  taxes  and  fees  on  gaming  activities.  From  time  to  time,  legislators  and  government  officials  have  proposed
changes  in  tax  laws,  or  in  the  administration  of  such  laws,  affecting  the  gaming  industry.  Periods  of  economic  downturn  or  uncertainty  and  budget
deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming
taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely  affected.  For  instance,  income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  currently  has  the  benefit  of  a  corporate  tax
exemption in Macau, which exempts us from paying the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games. This exemption
is effective through March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. Due to the uncertainty
concerning  taxation after  the subconcession renewal process, we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond
March 31, 2020.

2011, MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or
directors of MGM China may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that
could have different implications f or us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into
with MGM China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

The land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Bellagio secure the obligations under our senior credit facility. In addition, the

senior credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and Bellagio.

MGM
China

MGM Macau occupies an approximately 10-acre site and MGM Cotai occupies an approximately 18-acre site, both of which are possessed under separate
land  concession  agreements  with  the  Macau  government.  The  MGM  China  credit  facility  is  secured  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  interest  in  the  MGM  Cotai  and
MGM Macau land concessions, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their
assets to secure the facility. The credit facility borrowings are non-recourse to us. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional
discussion on long-term debt.

Operating
Partnership

Pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”), the real estate
assets  of  The  Mirage,  Mandalay  Bay,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York,  Park  MGM,  Excalibur,  The  Park,  Gold  Strike  Tunica,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  Beau  Rivage,
Borgata,  and  MGM  National  Harbor  are  leased  from  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  land  and  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  MGP’s  properties
including the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, other than MGM National Harbor and Empire City, secure the obligations under the Operating Partnership’s
credit agreement. These borrowings are non-recourse to us. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on long-term
debt.

Other than as described above, none of our properties are subject to any major encumbrance.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

October
1
litigation.
We and/or certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017 shooting in
Las  Vegas.  The  matters  involve  in  large  degree  the  same  legal  and  factual  issues,  each  case  being  filed  on  behalf  of  individuals  who  are  seeking  damages  for
emotional distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death based on assertions that we and/or certain of our subsidiaries were
negligent. We also received letters from attorneys purporting to represent other persons with claims related to the October 1, 2017 shooting. Lawsuits were first filed
in October 2017 and include actions filed by multiple individuals in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada and in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County,
California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed, and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate re-filing the lawsuits in similar form. In June
2018, we removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in California and Nevada state courts following the voluntary dismissals. Motions to remand
have been filed in several cases, and we anticipate that there may be additional motions to remand filed in the future. We also initiated declaratory relief actions in
federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue. Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. In
February of 2019, we and plaintiffs’ counsel commenced mediation of these matters.  The above-described litigation currently is stayed pending mediation .

We are currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigation
related to this matter. We will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information and
future  circumstances.  We  intend  to  defend  against  these  lawsuits  and  ultimately  believe  we  should  prevail,  but  litigation  of  this  type  is  inherently  unpredictable.
Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability, we currently
believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The foregoing determination was made in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of us or any of our affiliates. Given that
these  cases  are  in  the  early  stages  and  in  light  of  the  uncertainties  surrounding  them,  we  do  not  currently  possess  sufficient  information  to  determine  a  range  of
reasonably possible liability. In the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our
insurance coverage. The insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connection
with these claims. In addition, our general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated
costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and
not limited by) the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available .

Other.
We are a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. Management does not believe that the

outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows .

Common
Stock
Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “MGM.”

There were approximately 3,657 record holders of our common stock as of February 22, 2019.

Dividend
Policy

The Company implemented  a dividend program in February 2017 pursuant to which it has paid regular  quarterly  dividends. The amount, declaration  and
payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors
it deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described below. In addition, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends
will  depend  upon  the  receipt  of  cash  from  our  operating  subsidiaries  to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.
Furthermore,  our  senior  credit  facility  contains  financial  covenants  and  restrictive  covenants  that  could  restrict  our  ability  to  pay  dividends,  subject  to  certain
exceptions. In addition, the Operating Partnership and MGM China credit facilities each contain limitations on the ability of the applicable subsidiary under each
credit agreement to pay dividends to us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.

On  May  10,  2018,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors  had  adopted  a  $2.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program,  and  that  the  previously
announced  $1.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program  had  been  completed.  All  repurchases  under  the  stock  repurchase  program  are  made  from  time  to  time  at  the
Company’s discretion in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which
would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. Repurchases under the
program  may  be  suspended  or  discontinued  at  any  time.  All  shares  repurchased  by  the  Company  during  the  quarter  ended  December  31,  2018  were  purchased

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

Executive
Overview

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort
amenities. We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.
Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability
of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We make
significant  investments  in  our  resorts  through  newly  remodeled  hotel  rooms,  restaurants,  entertainment  and  nightlife  offerings,  as  well  as  other  new features  and
amenities.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue

to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, Las Vegas visitor volume decreased 0.2%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 1% and Las Vegas Strip gaming
revenue  increased  by 2%  compared  to the  prior  year  period  according  to  information  published  by the  Las  Vegas Convention  and  Visitors  Authority.  Results  of
operations for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts during 2018 were negatively impacted by disruption related to the repositioning and rebranding of Park MGM, discussed
below.

Our Regional Operations results are driven and affected by the increasingly competitive jurisdictions that they operate in, including the expansion of other
jurisdictions that permit gaming. Results of operations at our Regional Operations were negatively affected by the opening of two casino resorts in Atlantic City,
New Jersey in June 2018, which impacted Borgata’s operating results, and benefitted from the opening of MGM Springfield in August 2018, discussed below.

Gross  gaming  revenue  in  the  Macau  market  increased  14%  in  2018  compared  to  2017,  primarily  as  a  result  of  growth  on  the  Cotai  Strip.  Additionally,
according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, visitor arrivals increased 10% and overnight visitors increased 7%
in 2018 compared to 2017. As a significant number of MGM Macau’s customers are from mainland China, we believe operating results at MGM Macau are affected
by economic conditions in mainland China as well as certain policy initiatives enacted in mainland China and Macau. Despite concerns over the sustainability of
economic growth in China, we expect the Macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to further development and penetration of the mainland China market and
infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau. We believe recent trends reflect stabilization and growth within the
Macau market as gross gaming revenue has increased consistently over the last several years. Additionally, we have seen growth due to the opening of MGM Cotai
in February 2018.

Pursuant to a master lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New
York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, and MGM National Harbor from the landlord.
See  Note  1  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  regarding  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  which  we  consolidate  in  our
financial statements, and Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP. All intercompany
transactions, including transactions under the master lease, have been eliminated in consolidation.

In July 2018, MGP completed its acquisition of the membership interests of Northfield, an Ohio limited liability company that owns the real estate assets and
operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park. Simultaneously with the close of the transaction, MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of Hard
Rock  Café  International  (STP),  Inc.  to  continue  to  serve  as  the  manager  of  the  property.  See  Note  4  and  Note  17  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements  for
information regarding this acquisition, the Empire City Acquisition, the Northfield OpCo sale, and the Park MGM Lease Transaction.

In  January  2019,  we  announced  the  implementation  of  the  MGM  2020  plan  to  further  reduce  costs,  improve  efficiencies  and  position  us  for  growth.  We
expect to deliver annualized Adjusted EBITDA benefit of $300 million in aggregate, consisting of $200 million by the end of 2020 and an additional $100 million by
the  end  of  2021.  The  MGM  2020  plan  will  be  a  company-wide,  business-optimization  initiative  aimed  to  leverage  a  more  centralized  organization  to  maximize
profitability and, through key investments in technology, lay the groundwork for our digital transformation to drive revenue growth.

Key
Performance
Indicators

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:

•

•

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 22% to 26% of table games drop and 18% to 21% of table games drop at our Las Vegas Strip
Resorts and Regional Operations, respectively, and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of slots handle and 9% to 9.5% of
slots handle at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations, respectively; and

Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room
(“REVPAR,”  a  summary  measure  of  hotel  results,  combining  ADR  and  occupancy  rate).  Our  calculation  of  ADR,  which  is  the  average  price  of
occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary  rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price.
Because  the  mix  of  rooms  provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,  particularly  to  casino  customers,  includes  a  disproportionate  suite  component,  the
composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are:

•

Gaming  revenue  indicators:  MGM  China  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  of  nonnegotiable  chip  wagers  won  by  MGM  China  calculated  as
nonnegotiable  chips  purchased  plus  nonnegotiable  chips  exchanged  less  nonnegotiable  chips  returned.  Turnover  provides  a  basis  for  measuring  VIP
casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.3% of turnover. Win for main floor gaming
operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 16% to 22% of table games drop.

Consolidated net revenues for 2018 increased 9% compared to 2017 due primarily to the opening of MGM Cotai on February 13, 2018 and the opening of
MGM Springfield on August 24, 2018. Consolidated net revenues for 2017 increased 14% compared to 2016 due primarily to the full year of operations at Borgata
and MGM National Harbor, an increase in casino revenue and rooms revenue at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and an increase in casino revenue at MGM China, as
discussed further below.

32

Consolid ated operating income in 2018 decreased 14% compared to 2017. C onsolidated operating income in 2018 benefited from a $45 million gain related
to the sale of Grand Victoria and also included $24 million of business interruption insurance proceeds primarily at Mandalay Bay. The prior year period included a
benefit of $36 million related to Borgata’s share of a property tax settlement from Atlantic City and a benefit of $45 million related to the modification of the NV
Energy  exit  fee,  which  included  the  benef  it  recognized  at  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  as  well  as  our  50%  share  of  the  benefit  recognized  at  CityCenter.
Consolidated operating income was negatively affected by the ramp up of operations at our recently opened MGM Springfield and MGM Cotai resorts i nclusive of
depreciation expense associated with the new resorts, disruption related to the rebranding at Park MGM, and an increase in corporate expense discussed below. In
addition, preopening and start-up expenses increased as discussed below in “Operati ng Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense, including share-
based compensation for corporate employees, increased to $419 million in 2018 from $357 million in 2017, and included $19 million in transaction costs, MGM
China  corporate  expense  of  $19  million,  and  costs  incurred  related  to  the  corporate  brand  campaign  and  the  MGM  2020  and  finance  modernization  initiatives.
Depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets at MGM China of $166 million was included in corporate in ou r non-GAAP reconciliations included
herein for 2018. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $148 million in 2018 compared to $146 million in 2017.

Consolidated operating income was $1.7 billion in 2017 and included the impact of the items discussed above as well as a full year of operations at Borgata
and MGM National Harbor. Operating income of $2.1 billion in 2016 included a $430 million gain recognized on the Borgata acquisition and a $401 million gain
related to the sale of Crystals at CityCenter, which was partially offset by charges of $152 million of NV Energy exit expense associated with our strategic decision
to  exit  the  fully  bundled  sales  system  of  NV  Energy.  Operating  income  in  2017  also  benefitted  from  a  decrease  in  preopening  expense  as  discussed  below  in
“Operating Results – Details of Certain Charges.” Corporate expense increased to $357 million in 2017 from $313 million in 2016, primarily from a $16 million
charge for the Operating Partnership’s share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, with the remainder of
the increase primarily related to corporate brand campaign expenses, legal expenses, and charitable contributions. Income from unconsolidated affiliates was $146
million in 2017 compared to $528 million in 2016, which included the gain related to the sale of Crystals.

Regional
Operations

Adjusted Property EBITDA at our Regional Operations increased 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 and benefitted from the opening of MGM Springfield and an
increase  in  casino  and  non-casino  revenue,  as  discussed  above.  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  margin  decreased  in  2018  by  114  basis  points  compared  to  2017  to
25.9%,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the  ramp  up  of  operations  at  MGM  Springfield,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  margin  at  Borgata  due  to  a
decrease in casino, rooms and food and beverage revenue as a result of inclement weather and increased competition in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Adjusted Property EBITDA at our Regional Operations increased 83% in 2017 compared to 2016 and benefitted from a full year of operations at Borgata and

National Harbor. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 27.0% in 2017 compared to 26.3% in 2016.

MGM
China

MGM China’s Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 6% in 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to the opening of MGM Cotai. Excluding intercompany
license fees of $43 million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 7% compared to
2017. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 23.2% in 2018 compared to 28.8% in 2017, decreasing primarily as a result of the ramp up of operations at MGM
Cotai and a decrease in win percentages for both main floor and VIP table games at MGM Macau.

MGM China’s Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding intercompany license fees of $34 million for both the years
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 1% compared to 2016. Adjusted Property EBITDA margin was 28.8% in 2017 compared
to 29.2% in 2016 and decreased in part as a result of a 7% increase in general and administrative expense.

Corporate
and
other

Adjusted EBITDA related to corporate and other in 2018 decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation, and
an  increase  in  corporate  expense  as  described  in  “Summary  Operating  Results,”  which  was  partially  offset  by  the  inclusion  of  $45  million  of  Adjusted  Property
EBITDA related to MGP’s Northfield casino.

Adjusted EBITDA related to corporate and other in 2017 decreased compared to the prior year due to our share of the gain recognized in 2016 from the sale
of Crystals at CityCenter, the gain on the acquisition  of Borgata in 2016 and an increase  in stock-based compensation,  partially  offset by the cessation of equity
method accounting for Borgata subsequent to the acquisition and an increase in corporate expense as described in “Summary Operating Results.” See “Operating

Preopening and start-up expenses increased in 2018 due primarily to an increase in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM Springfield (which opened in
August 2018) and at Park MGM as part of the property’s rebranding, which was partially offset by a decrease in preopening at MGM China due to the opening of
MGM Cotai in February 2018.

Preopening and start-up expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a decrease in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM Nat ional
Harbor (as it opened in December 2016), partially offset by an increase in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM China related to MGM Cotai and at Park MGM
as part of the property’s rebranding.

We  completed  our  acquisition  of  Borgata  on  August  1,  2016  and  therefore  began  to  consolidate  Borgata  beginning  on  that  date.  Prior  thereto  our  50%

ownership interest in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method.

In  2018, our  share  of  CityCenter’s  operating  results,  including  certain  basis  difference  adjustments,  was $138  million  compared  to  $133  million  in  2017,
primarily due to a $12 million gain on the sale of Mandarin Oriental that we recognized in 2018 related to the reversal of basis differences in excess of our share of
the loss recorded by CityCenter. At Aria, casino revenues decreased 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to an increase in incentives and a decrease in table games
hold.  CityCenter’s  non-casino  revenues  increased  7%  in  2018 compared  to  2017  primarily  related  to  an  increase  in  food  and  beverage  revenue  due  in  part  to  an
increase in restaurant revenues and an increase in catering and banquets during the year.

In  2017, our  share  of  CityCenter’s  operating  results,  including  certain  basis  difference  adjustments,  was $133  million  compared  to  $446  million  in  2016,
primarily due to our $401 million share of a gain recognized by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals and the corresponding reversal of certain basis differences  in
2016. At Aria, casino revenues increased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in table games win and slots win. Rooms revenue increased 4% in 2017
compared to 2016 related to an increase in REVPAR and food and beverage revenue increased 6% in 2017 due in part to an increase in catering and banquets during
the year.

Gross interest expense in 2018 increased $41 million compared to 2017 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding relating to our senior notes and our
credit facilities  and an increase  in the weighted aver age interest rate of our credit facilities,  partially offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs.
Gross  interest  expense  decreased  in  2017  compared  to  2016  primarily  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  the  average  debt  outstanding  related  to  our  senior  notes  and  a
decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. This was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding under our credit facilities
and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 9 t o the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on long-term debt
and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.

Capitalized interest in 2018 decreased from 2017 due primarily to the substantial completion of MGM Cotai in February 2018, partially offset by an increase
related to the MGM Springfield project, which was substantially completed in August 2018. Capitalized interest in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to the
opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016, partially offset by the MGM Cotai and MGM Springfield projects.

Non-operating
items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 Non-operating  expense  from  unconsolidated  affiliates  decreased  $18  million  in  2017  compared  to
2016, due primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time, we began to consolidate Borgata. Prior thereto, our 50% ownership interest in
Borgata was accounted for under the equity method.

Other,
net.
Other expense in 2018 decreased $30 million compared to 2017 due primarily to the loss incurred on early retirement of debt in 2017 of $44
million related to our early retirement of the 11.375% senior notes due 2018 and the MGM National Harbor credit facility. Other expense in 2017 decreased $24
million compared to 2016 primarily due to the loss on the early retirement of debt in 2016 of $65 million related to our 7.625% senior notes due 2017, our 7.5%
senior notes due 2016, our 10% senior notes due 2016, and our prior senior credit facility, offset by the loss on early retirement of debt incurred in 2017 as described
above.

Our  effective  tax  rate  for  2018  was  favorably  impacted  by  the  reduction  in  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  rate  from  35%  to  21%,  the  reversal  of  Macau
shareholder dividend tax that was accrued in 2017 upon receipt of the extension of the annual fee arrangement, partially offset by SAB 118 measurement period tax
expense related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  Our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income tax
benefit of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required due to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by the
accrual of the Macau shareholder dividend tax. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation
allowance  on  foreign  tax  credit  (“FTC”)  carryovers  and  permanent  exclusion  of  a  portion  of  the  gain  on  the  Borgata  transaction,  partially  offset  by  income  tax
expense attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the
Macau complementary tax on gaming profits.

Cash taxes paid decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act changes, most notably the increase in the recapture of overall domestic losses
from  50  percent  of  U.S.  taxable  income  to  100  percent  of  U.S.  taxable  income,  resulting  in  increased  FTC  carryover  usage.    Cash  taxes  paid  increased  in  2017
compared  to  2016  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  federal  income  taxes  paid  resulting  from  increased  U.S.  taxable  income  and  state  income  taxes  attributable  to
Borgata, which has been consolidated since the August 2016 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in the company.

Non-GAAP
Measures

“Adjusted  EBITDA”  is  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up
expenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate
expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. “Adjusted Property EBITDA margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDA divided by
net  revenues.  Adjusted  EBITDA  information  is  presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  these
measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies.

39

We believe  that while items excluded  from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, and Adjusted Property EBITDA margin may be recurring  in
nature  and  should  not  be  disregarded  in  evaluation  of  our  earnings  performance,  it  is  useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trends
compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between
the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example,
preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on
where  the  current  period  lies  within  the  development  cycle,  as  well  as  the  size  and  scope  of  the  project(s).  Property  transactions,  net  includes  normal  recurring
disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a
group  of  resorts  and  impairment  charges  on  entire  asset  groups  or  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  may  not  be  comparable  period  over  period.  In
addition,  capital  allocation,  tax  planning,  financing  and  stock  compensation  awards  are  all  managed  at  the  corporate  level.  Therefore,  we  use  Adjusted  Property
EBITDA as the primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net
income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt
principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin. Also, other companies in the
gaming  and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  or  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  margin  information  may  calculate
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA margin in a different manner.

Operating
activities.
 Trends  in  our  operating  cash  flows  tend  to  follow  trends  in  operating  income,  excluding  non-cash  charges,  but  can  be  affected  by
changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by
operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017. Operating cash flows decreased in the current period primarily due to the change in
working capital related to timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China, as well as a decrease in consolidated operating income, and
an increase in cash paid for interest. In 2018 we received net cash tax refunds of $10 million compared to cash paid for taxes of $182 million in 2017 primarily as a
result of the Tax Act.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2017 in comparison to 2016 was positively affected by increase in operating income at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts
and  Regional  Operations  and  changes  in  working  capital  primarily  related  to  the  timing  of  significant  purchases  of  chips  by  gaming  promoters  at  MGM  China,
partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes to $182 million in 2017 compared to $68 million in 2016.

43

Investing
activities.
 Our  investing  cash  flows  can  fluctuate  significantly  from  year  to  year  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capital
investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts.
Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces
and hotel rooms.

Cash  used  in  investing  activities  in  2018  increased  in  comparison  to  2017  as  a  result  of  the  $1.0  billion  outflow  by  the  Operating  Partnership  for  the
Northfield acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $377 million in capital expenditures as well as an inflow of $164 million for proceeds received related to the
sale  of  our  investment  in  Grand  Victoria.  The  decrease  in  capital  expenditures  from  2018  to  2017  of  $377  million  primarily  reflects  less  expenditures  for  the
developments  of  MGM  Cotai  and  MGM  National  Harbor,  partially  offset  by  increased  expenditures  for  MGM  Springfield  and  the  rebranding  at  Park  MGM,  as
discussed in further detail below.

Cash used in investing activities in 2017 decreased in comparison to 2016 as a result of the $559 million outflow for the Borgata acquisition in 2016 as well
as  a  $398  million  decrease  in  capital  expenditures,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  of  $240  million  in  the  distributions  received  from  CityCenter.    The  decrease  in
capital  expenditures  from  2016  to  2017  of  $398  million  primarily  reflects  less  expenditures  for  the  developments  of  MGM  Cotai  and  MGM  National  Harbor,
partially offset by increased expenditures for MGM Springfield and the rebranding of Park MGM, as discussed in further detail below.

Capital
Expenditures

In 2018, we had capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, of which $376 million related to MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on
development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $340 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $36 million
related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.1 billion included $368
million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $228 million related to the Park MGM rebranding project, as well as expenditures relating to the expansion
of the convention center at MGM Grand Las Vegas and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.

In 2017, we had capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, which included $908 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on
development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $856 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $53 million
related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $956 million included
$269  million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  Springfield,  $221  million  related  to  the  rebranding  at  Park  MGM,  and  $195  million  primarily  related  to  the
finalization of construction of MGM National Harbor, as well as various resorts’ room remodels, construction of additional convention space at MGM Grand Las
Vegas, the parking garage at Excalibur, a waterpark at Circus Circus, and various restaurant and entertainment venue remodels.

In 2016, we had capital expenditures of $2.3 billion, which included $971 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on
development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $948 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $23 million
related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.3 billion included
$741  million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  National  Harbor,  $121  million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  Springfield,  $39  million  related  to  the
construction of The Park, as well as various room remodels including the tower rooms at Mandalay Bay, construction of additional exhibit space at the Mandalay
Bay  Convention  Center,  construction  of  the  Park  Theater  and  rebranding  at  Park  MGM,  construction  of  the  parking  garage  at  Excalibur  and  restaurant  and
entertainment venue remodels .

Financing
activities.
Cash provided by financing activities increased in 2018 from the cash used in financing activities in 2017 primarily as a result of net
borrowings of debt in 2018 of $2.2 billion in comparison to net repayments of debt in 2017 of $138 million, partially offset by MGP’s issuance of class A shares in
2017, and an increase in shares repurchased in 2018 compared to 2017.

Cash used in financing activities decreased in 2017 from the cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily as a result of the net proceeds of $1.1
billion from MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2016 compared to the net proceeds of  $388 million from MGP’s issuance of class A shares in 2017, dividends that
we began paying in 2017, as well as an increase of $67 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest owners, partially offset by net payments of debt in 2017 of
$138  million  compared  to  net  repayments  of  debt  of  $301  million  in  2016  as  well  as  the  $100  million  paid  in  2016  as  part  of  consideration  for  the  purchase  of
additional shares of MGM China.

Borrowings
(repayments)
of
debt

In 2018, we borrowed net debt of $2.2 billion which primarily consisted of the issuance of $1.0 billion 5.750% senior notes due 2025, $368 million of net
borrowings on our senior credit facility, $137 million of net borrowings on the MGM China credit facility, and $728 million of net borrowings on the Operating
Partnership senior credit facility. Additionally, we paid $77 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendments of the Operating Partnership’s senior credit
facility in March and June 2018, the amendment of MGM China’s credit facility in June 2018, the amendment of our senior credit facility in December 2018, and the
issuance of the $1.0 billion 5.750% senior notes.

In  2017, we repaid net debt of $138 million which primarily consisted of a $135 million draw on our senior credit facility, a $462 million draw on the MGM
China credit facility, and a $28 million draw on the MGM National Harbor credit facility, as well as the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $350 million 4.50%
senior notes due 2028 in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, partially offset by the redemption of our $475 million 11.375% senior notes at a
premium, the repayment of $478 million MGM National Harbor credit facility, as well as amortization payments of $132 million on our term loan facilities.

In 2016, we repaid net debt of $301 million. In April 2016, in connection with the MGP IPO and related financing transactions we permanently repaid $2.7
billion under our prior senior secured credit facility and entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility under which we borrowed $250 million.
The Operating Partnership borrowed net debt of $2.1 billion during 2016 under its senior credit facility. In addition, MGM National Harbor borrowed $450 million
under  its  credit  facility,  MGM  China  borrowed  $374  million  under  its  revolving  credit  facility,  and  we  permanently  repaid  $584  million  under  Borgata’s  credit

Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity

Anticipated
uses
of
cash.
 We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize
corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts
daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. In addition, from
time  to  time  we  may  use  excess  funds  to  repurchase  our  outstanding  debt  and  equity  securities  subject  to  limitations  in  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  and
Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and
acquisitions.

We held cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018, of which MGM China held $510 million and the Operating Partnership held $60
million. At December 31, 2018, we had $15.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $750 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.3 billion
senior secured credit facility, $2.8 billion outstanding under the $3.6 billion Operating Partnership credit facility, and $2.4 billion outstanding under the $2.8 billion
MGM China credit facility. We expect to make domestic capital investments at our resorts and corporate entities of $600 million to $650 million, which excludes
$45 million to $50 million of construction closeout costs at MGM Springfield. Additionally, we expect to make capital investments at MGM China of $350 million
to $375 million, which includes $250 million of construction closeout costs at MGM Cotai and $100 million to $125 million of maintenance capital expenditures.

We also closed the acquisition of Empire City in January 2019 for a purchase price of approximately $864 million. We funded the acquisition of Empire City
with the issuance of approximately $266 million of our common stock, the assumption of approximately $246 million of debt, which was immediately assumed and
repaid by the Operating Partnership, and the remaining balance in cash. Additionally, in January 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2027 and, in February 2019, we repaid our $850 million 8.625% notes due 2019. We expect to meet our remaining debt
maturities and planned capital expenditure requirements with future anticipated operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our
credit facilities.

Principal
Debt
Arrangements

See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2018.

Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consists primarily of our investment in CityCenter.
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions, other than the Operating Partnership’s
cash flow hedges. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to
realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment facilities in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. In addition, there
are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full
ownership of the resort.

Reflects scheduled amortization payments and debt maturities. Refer to Note 9 for further information on long-term debt.
Estimated interest payments, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 and
management’s forecasted LIBOR rates for our senior credit facility, the Operating Partnership senior credit facility and HIBOR rates for the MGM China credit facility.
Refer to Note 11 for further information on operating leases.
Reflects future expected cash outlays of our other long-term liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, and, accordingly, we have not included such liabilities above
that do not have future cash payments, such as deferred rent. We have also excluded deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented in the table as
the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain.
Our purchase obligations  represent minimum  obligations  we have under agreements with certain of our vendors, primarily  advertising and entertainment  contracts. Also, although  open
purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior
to the delivery of goods or performance of services, and hence, have not been included in the table above.

Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates
and assumptions that affect  the amounts reported  in the consolidated  financial  statements.  We regularly  evaluate  these estimates  and assumptions, particularly  in
areas  we  consider  to  be  critical  accounting  estimates,  where  changes  in  the  estimates  and  assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,
financial position or cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our
critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of
uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

Allowance
for
Doubtful
Casino
Accounts
Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to
the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and gaming
promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances
timely.  These  collection  efforts  are  similar  to  those  used  by  most  large  corporations  when  dealing  with  overdue  customer  accounts,  including  the  mailing  of
statements  and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.  Markers  are  generally  legally  enforceable
instruments  in  the  United  States  and  Macau.  Markers  are  not  legally  enforceable  instruments  in  some  foreign  countries,  but  the  United  States  assets  of  foreign
customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when
we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit
worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s casino receivables and those
due from customers residing in foreign countries.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating
expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is
not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is
significant,  we  apply  standard  reserve  percentages  to  aged  account  balances  under  a  specified  dollar  amount  and  specifically  analyze  the  collectability  of  each
account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known
information. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial
condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.

47

In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors,
including  changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  economic  conditions  in  the  customers’  home  countries.  Because  individual  customer  account  balances  can  be
significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a
region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

Approximately $48 million and $31 million of casino receivables and $12 million and $7 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable
relate to MGM China at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in
the current year due to a decrease in specific reserve at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts as a result of favorable collections. At December 31, 2018, a 100 basis-point
change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $4 million.

Fixed
Asset
Capitalization
and
Depreciation
Policies

Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  was
therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its
life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we
construct  assets,  we  capitalize  direct  costs  of  the  project,  including  fees  paid  to  architects  and  contractors,  property  taxes,  and  certain  costs  of  our  design  and
construction  subsidiaries.  In  addition,  interest  cost  associated  with  major  development  and  construction  projects  is  capitalized  as  part  of  the  cost  of  the  project.
Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts
when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We  must  make  estimates  and  assumptions  when  accounting  for  capital  expenditures.  Whether  an  expenditure  is  considered  a  maintenance  expense  or  a
capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,
which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful
lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever
events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Indefinite-lived
Intangible
Assets

We  evaluate  our  property  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  based  on  our  classification  as  held  for  sale  or  to  be  held  and  used.
Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset
at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying
value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held
and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted
basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not
exceed  the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typically  measured  using  a
discounted  cash  flow  model  whereby  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  using  a  weighted-average  cost  of  capital,  developed  using  a  standard  capital  asset  pricing
model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized
impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

48

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the
asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the g rouping of assets. Future cash
flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.
Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic
factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets
and probability  weight cash flows in certain  circumstances  to consider alternative  outcomes associated  with recoverability  of the asset group, including potential
sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test
for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For
our 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and
concluded  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  such  intangibles  exceeded  their  carrying  values  by  a  substantial  margin.  We  elected  to  perform  a
quantitative analysis for the Borgata trade name using the relief-from -royalty method, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14% in
2018 and 4% in 2017. For our 2016 annual impairment tests we utilized a quantitative analysis for all of our intangible assets, using a discounted cash flow approach
for license rights and using the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks. The estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying
values, with the fair value of the Borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the Borgata acquisition which
occurred in August 2016. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do
not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment
charge.

We review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment
charges  in  2018,  2017  or  2016.  For  our  2018,  2017,  and  2016  annual  impairment  tests,  we  utilized  the  option  to  perform  a  step  zero  analysis  for  certain  of  our
reporting  units and concluded it  was more likely  than  not that  the fair  values  of such reporting  units exceeded  their carrying  values  by a substantial  margin.  For
reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis, the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin.
As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet
current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment
charge.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and
actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment
tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Impairment
of
Investments
in
Unconsolidated
Affiliates

See Note 2 to the  accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of  other-than-temporary impairment of investments in

unconsolidated affiliates.  None of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had other-than-temporary impairment in 2018, 2017, or 2016.

Income
Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with

a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

49

We file income tax returns in the U.S. feder al jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in
foreign jurisdictions are not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions
taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 10 in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record
as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” or
long-term  in  “Other  long-term  liabilities”  based  on  the  time  until  expected  payment.  Additionally,  we  recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties,  if  any,  related  to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.

AND
QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES
ABOUT
MARKET
RISK

Market
Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising
from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk
associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings
and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the Operating
Partnership’s  term  loan  B  facility.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debt
instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by
changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments
for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

As of December 31, 2018, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 31% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million and $700
million notional amount Operating Partnership interest rate swaps with weighted average fixed rates that we pay 1.764% and 1.901%, respectively. In December
2018, the Operating Partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements, for which the Operating Partnership will pay a weighted average 2.735% on a
total  notional  amount  of  $400  million.  These  swaps  will  be  effective  December  31,  2019,  at  which  point  the  Operating  Partnership  will  be  paying  a  combined
weighted  average  2.066%.  The  following  table  provides  additional  information  about  our  gross  long-term  debt  subject  to  changes  in  interest  rates  excluding  the
effect of the Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

In addition  to the risk associated  with our variable  interest  rate  debt, we are  also exposed to risks  related  to changes  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates,
mainly  related  to  MGM  China  and  to  our  operations  at  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai.  While  recent  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  have  not  been  significant,
potential  changes  in  policy  by  governments  or  fluctuations  in  the  economies  of  the  United  States,  China,  Macau  or  Hong  Kong  could  cause  variability  in  these
exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will
remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. As of December 31,
2018, a 1% increase in the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash
balance by $5 million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $25 million.

Opinion
on
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance  with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
financial  statements and financial  statement schedule as of and for the year ended December  31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2019,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis
for
Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control  based  on the assessed  risk, and performing  such other  procedures  as we considered  necessary  in the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our audit  provides  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition
and
Limitations
of
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in
accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
on
the
Financial
Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2), (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's

Basis
for
Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits  included  performing  procedures  to
assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Organization.
MGM Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise,

the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas,
The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM (which was branded as Monte Carlo prior to May 2018), Excalibur and Circus Circus Las
Vegas. Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a condominium-hotel consisting of three towers.
The  Company  operates  and,  along  with  local  investors,  owns  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan,  MGM  National  Harbor  in  Prince  George’s  County,
Maryland  and  MGM  Springfield  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts,  which  opened  on  August  24,  2018.  The  Company  also  owns  and  operates  Borgata  located  on
Renaissance  Pointe  in  the  Marina  area  of  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey  and  the  following  resorts  in  Mississippi:  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi  and  Gold  Strike  in  Tunica.
Additionally, the Company owns the Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM, Shadow Creek, an exclusive
world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Primm Valley Golf Club at the California/Nevada state line and Fallen
Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as
an UPREIT) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through MGM Growth Properties
Operating  Partnership  LP  (the  “Operating  Partnership”).  MGP  has  two  classes  of  authorized  and  outstanding  voting  common  shares  (collectively,  the  “shares”):
Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to
receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while the
Company, as the owner of the Class B share, is entitled to an amount of votes representing  a majority  of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the
Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership
does  not  fall  below  30%.  The  Company  and  MGP  each  hold  Operating  Partnership  units  representing  limited  partner  interests  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The
general partner of the Operating Partnership is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP. The Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into
Class  A  shares  of  MGP  on  a  one-to-one  basis,  or  cash  at  the  fair  value  of  a  Class  A  share.  The  determination  of  settlement  method  is  at  the  option  of  MGP’s
independent conflicts committee. The Company and MGP’s ownership interest percentage in the Operating Partnership have varied based upon the transactions that
MGP  has  completed,  as  discussed  in  Note  12.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  Company  owned  73.3%  of  the  Operating  Partnership  units,  and  MGP  held  the
remaining 26.7% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.

Pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company (the “tenant”) and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”), the
tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand
Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, and MGM National Harbor from the landlord.

In July 2018, MGP acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owns the
real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park from Milstein Entertainment LLC. Simultaneously with the close of the transaction,
MGP entered into a new agreement with an affiliate of Hard Rock Café International (STP), Inc. to continue to serve as the manager of the property. Refer to Note 4
for additional information.

In September  2018, the Company entered  into an agreement  with MGP to acquire  all of the operating  assets of Northfield  from MGP. Northfield  will be
added  to  the  existing  master  lease  between  the  Company  and  MGP.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  first  half  of  2019,  subject  to  customary  closing
conditions. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.

In January 2019, the Company acquired  the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's race track and casino ("Empire City").
MGP  then  acquired  the  developed  real  property  associated  with  Empire  City  from  the  Company  and  the  real  estate  assets  of  Empire  City  will  be  leased  to  the
Company pursuant to an amendment to the master lease. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.

60

The  Company  has  an  approximate  56%  controlling  interest  in  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.  A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”).  MGM
Grand Paradise owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment  resort located on the Cotai
Strip in Macau that opened on February 13, 2018, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.

The Company owns 50% of and manages CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”), located between Bellagio and Park MGM. The other 50% of CityCenter
is owned by Infinity World Development Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter
consists of Aria, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort; and Vdara, a luxury condominium-hotel. On August 30, 2018, CityCenter completed the sale of
the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas (“Mandarin Oriental”) and adjacent retail parcels. See Note 6 and Note 17 for additional information related to CityCenter.

The Company and a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (“AEG”) each own 42.5% of the Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC (“Las Vegas Arena
Company”),  the  entity  which  owns  the  T-Mobile  Arena,  and  Athena  Arena,  LLC  owns  the  remaining  15%.  The  Company  also  manages  the  T-Mobile  Arena.
Additionally, the Company leases the MGM Grand Garden Arena, located adjacent to the MGM Grand Las Vegas, to the Las Vegas Arena Company. See Note 6 for
additional information regarding the Company’s investment in the Las Vegas Arena Company.

In  August  2018,  the  Company,  along  with  its  joint  venture  partner,  completed  the  sale  of  its  50%  interest  in  Grand  Victoria,  a  riverboat  casino  in  Elgin,

Illinois. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the Company’s investment in Grand Victoria.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  the  Company  has  changed  the  aggregation  of  its  operations  into  three  reportable  segments:  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts,
Regional  Operations  and  MGM  China.  This  change  of  reportable  segments  reflects  realignment  within  the  Company  stemming  from  the  expansion  of  the
Company’s regional operations. See Note 16 for additional information about the Company’s segments.

NOTE
2
—
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles
of
consolidation.
 For  entities  not  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”),  the  Company  consolidates  such  entities  in  which  the
Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has the
direct  or indirect  ability  to  control  the  entities’  activities  based  upon  the  terms  of the  respective  entities’  ownership agreements.  For these  entities,  the  Company
records  a  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  Company’s  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  which  are  50%  or  less  owned  are
accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  when  the  Company  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  or  has  joint  control  of  the  unconsolidated  affiliate.  All
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A
VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that
most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power
to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the
VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For
these  VIEs,  the  Company  records  a  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  Company  may  change  its  original  assessment  of  a  VIE  upon
subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the
disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

Management has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the
activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP
and  consolidates  MGP  because  (i)  its  ownership  of  MGP’s  single  Class  B  share  entitles  it  to  a  majority  of  the  total  voting  power  of  MGP’s  shares,  and  (ii)  the
exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant to
MGP.  The  Company  has  recorded  MGP’s  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  of  26.7%  as  of  December  31,  2018  as  noncontrolling  interest  in  the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $11.0 billion, primarily related to its real
estate investments, and total liabilities of $5.1 billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.

61

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make est imates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Act ual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates,  cost  method  investments,  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that
includes:  Level  1  inputs,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  an  active  market;  Level  2  inputs,  which  are  observable  inputs  for  similar  assets;  or  Level  3  inputs,  which  are
unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:

•

•

Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;
Level  2  and  Level  3  inputs  when  assessing  the  fair  value  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  during  the  Northfield  transaction  and  Borgata
transaction. See Note 4.

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of
acquisition.  Such  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Book  overdraft  balances  resulting  from  the  Company’s  cash  management
program are recorded as accounts payable or construction payable as applicable.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino
accounts  receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  of
creditworthiness. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 62% and 40%, respectively, of our gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from
foreign countries, primarily Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be
uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the
Company’s  receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.  The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customer
accounts  as  well  as  historical  collection  experience  and  current  economic  and  business  conditions.  Management  believes  that  as  of  December  31,  2018,  no
significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.

Inventories.
 Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net
realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined
using the cost method.

Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through
business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the
determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued $47 million and $28
million, respectively for property and equipment within accounts payable, and $2 million and $34 million, respectively, related to construction retention within other
long-term liabilities.

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

15 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 15 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and
used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the
asset at a reasonable  price in relation to its fair value and is actively  seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes  the asset at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be
held and

62

used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash
flows do not exceed the carr ying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow
model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized im pairment losses, whether for assets held for
sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

Capitalized
interest.
The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized  and included in the cost of the project.
When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s
outstanding  borrowings.  Capitalization  of  interest  ceases  when  the  project  is  substantially  complete  or  development  activity  is  suspended  for  more  than  a  brief
period.

Investments
in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equity
method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences,
as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment
and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as
gains  and  impairments  related  to  its  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  as  a  component  of  operating  income  or  loss  and  classifies  non-operating  income  or
losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated
affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of
the  investment  to  its  carrying  value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines  whether  the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary”  based  on  its
assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a
discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that
utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 6 for results of the Company’s review of its
investment in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates.

Goodwill
and
other
intangible
assets.
 Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business
combinations.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain
circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of
the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred to
as “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers macroeconomic
conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  current  and  forecasted  financial  performance,  entity-specific  events,  and  changes  in  the  composition  or  carrying
amount  of  net  assets  of  reporting  units  for  goodwill.  In  addition,  the  Company  takes  into  consideration  the  amount  of  excess  of  fair  value  over  carrying  value
determined  in  the  last  quantitative  analysis  that  was performed,  as  well  as  the  period  of  time  that  has  passed  since  the  last  quantitative  analysis.  If  the  step  zero
analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.

Under the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
future  results  of  the  Company’s  reporting  units  discounted  using  market  discount  rates  and  market  indicators  of  terminal  year  capitalization  rates,  and  a  market
approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company
adopted accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly
“Step 2”) in the event that impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting
unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment
using  a  discounted  cash  flow  approach,  and  trademarks  are  tested  for  impairment  using  the  relief-from-royalty  method.  If  the  fair  value  of  an  indefinite-lived
intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.

Revenue
recognition.
The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beverage

transactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.

63

The  transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstance  s,  the  Company  offers
discounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gaming
promoters and VIP players at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis given
the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.

For  casino  wager  transactions  that  include  other  goods  and  services  provided  by  the  Company  to  gaming  patrons  on  a  discretionary  basis  to  incentivize
gaming,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  stand-alone  selling  price  (“SSP”).
Discretionary goods and services provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.

For casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of net
win based upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive.
When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deducted
from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives provided
to  gaming  customers  were  collectively  $2.3  billion,  $2.1  billion  and  $1.8  billion  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  respectively.  After
allocating revenue to other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue.

The  transaction  price  of  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  retail  contracts  is  the  net  amount  collected  from  the  customer  for  such  goods  and  services.  The
transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is
made for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts as an
agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well as customer
rooms arranged by online travel agents.

The Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with
hotel  stays  and  convention  services.  For  such  arrangements,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  to  each  good  or  service  based  on  its  relative  SSP.  The  Company
primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold
separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.

Contract
and
Contract-Related
Liabilities.
There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,
resulting  in  a  contract  or  contract-related  liability. The  Company generally has  three  types of  liabilities  related  to  contracts  with  customers:  (1)  outstanding chip
liability,  which  represents  the  amounts  owed  in  exchange  for  gaming  chips  held  by  a  customer,  (2)  loyalty  program  obligations,  which  represents  the  deferred
allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by
customers  before  gaming  play  occurs  (“casino  front  money”)  and  advance  payments  on  goods  and  services  yet  to  be  provided  such  as  advance  ticket  sales  and
deposits  on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  being
purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Reimbursed
costs.
 Costs reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when the
Company  performs  its  related  performance  obligation  and  is  entitled  to  reimbursement.  Reimbursed  costs  relate  primarily  to  the  Company’s  management  of
CityCenter.

Revenue
by
source.
The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage,

and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 16. Lease

64

revenues  earned  by the Company from  third-parties  are  classified  within the line  item corresponding  to the type or nature  of the tenant’s  good or service.  Lease
revenues include $51 million, $51 million and $50 million recorded wit hin food and beverage revenue for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $87 million, $79
million and $77 million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively.

Advertising.
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense, which is generally included in general

and administrative expenses, was $305 million, $223 million and $171 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Corporate
expense.
Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll, aircraft costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
Company’s  casino  resort  operations.  In  addition,  corporate  expense  includes  the  costs  associated  with  the  Company’s  evaluation  and  pursuit  of  new  business
opportunities, which are expensed as incurred.

Preopening
and
start-up
expenses.
Preopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopening

and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.

Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on the

sale of assets as “Property transactions, net.” See Note 15 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Redeemable
noncontrolling
interest.
Certain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which provide
for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as defined
in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90-days after the end of each fiscal year.

Beginning on December 31, 2019 the noncontrolling interest parties will each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion
of their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula. Additionally, certain noncontrolling interest parties each have the right to sell
back all or a portion of their interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or grant liens to secure any indebtedness of the Company or its
affiliates other than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor.

The Company has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and  not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  The  interests  were  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.
Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to
equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records
any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjusted
for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

stock.
The table below reconciles basic and diluted income per share of common stock. Diluted net income attributable to
common stockholders includes adjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests and the potentially dilutive effect on the Company’s equity interests in MGP and
MGM China due to shares outstanding under their respective stock compensation plans. Diluted weighted-average common and common equivalent shares include
adjustments for potential dilution of share-based awards outstanding under the Company’s stock compensation plan.

Currency
translation.
 The  Company  translates  the  financial  statements  of  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  not  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.  Balance  sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).

Accumulated
other
comprehensive
income
(loss).
 Comprehensive  income  (loss)  includes  net  income  (loss)  and  all  other  non-stockholder  changes  in
equity, or other comprehensive income (loss). Elements of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income are reported in the accompanying consolidated
statements of stockholders’ equity. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest expense
as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt.

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842 “Leases (Topic 842)”, which replaces the existing guidance in Topic
840, “Leases”, (“ASC 842”). ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 842 requires a
dual  approach  for  lessee  accounting  under  which  a  lessee  would  classify  and  account  for  its  lease  agreements  as  either  finance  or  operating.  Both  finance  and
operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee will recognize
interest  expense  associated  with  the  lease  liability  and  depreciation  expense  associated  with  the  ROU  asset;  and  for  operating  leases,  the  lessee  will  recognize
straight-line  rent  expense.  The  Company  will  adopt  ASC  842  on  January  1,  2019  utilizing  the  simplified  transition  method  and  accordingly  will  not  recast
comparative period financial information. The Company will elect the basket of transition practical expedients which includes not needing to reassess: (1) whether
any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) direct costs for any existing leases. The
Company  also  currently  expects  that  the  most  significant  impact  will  be  the  recognition  of  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  operating  leases  that  exist  at  the
Company on the date of adoption with the most material of such leases being ground leases.

On  July  6,  2018,  MGP  completed  its  acquisition  of  100%  of  the  membership  interests  of  Northfield  for  a  purchase  price  of  approximately  $1.1  billion
(“Northfield Acquisition”). MGP funded the acquisition through a $200 million draw on the Operating Partnership’s term loan A and a $655 million draw under the
Operating Partnership’s revolving credit facility, with the remainder of the purchase price paid with cash on hand. The acquisition expanded MGP’s real estate assets
and diversified MGP’s geographic reach.

MGP recognized 100% of the assets and liabilities of Northfield at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using both level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs
for similar assets, and level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The allocation of fair value for substantially all of the assets and liabilities is preliminary and
may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition. Specifically, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is finalizing valuation work related to the asset classes that
comprise the property and equipment acquired.

The following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocation as of July 6, 2018 (in thousands):

MGP  recognized  the  identifiable  intangible  assets  at  fair  value.  The  estimated  fair  values  of  the  intangible  assets  were  preliminarily  determined  using
methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to
arise after the acquisition.

As further discussed in Note 17, the Company entered into an agreement with MGP to acquire all of the operating assets of Northfield (“Northfield OpCo”)
from MGP and the real estate assets of Northfield will be leased to a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject
to customary closing conditions. The transaction will be an intercompany transaction and, accordingly, the effect will be eliminated in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Consolidated
results.
For the period from July 6, 2018 through December 31, 2018, Northfield’s net revenue was $133 million, operating income and net
income were both $33 million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because it is not material to the consolidated results of
operations.

Empire
City

On January 29, 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's race track and casino (“Empire City”)
for  total  consideration  of  approximately  $864  million,  plus  customary  working  capital  and  other  adjustments  (“Empire  City  Acquisition”).  The  fair  value  of
consideration paid included the assumption of debt of approximately $246 million, which was subsequently repaid, the issuance of approximately $266 million of
the Company’s common stock, and the remaining balance in cash. If Empire City is awarded a license for live table games on or prior to December 31, 2022 and the
Company accepts such license by December 31, 2024, the Company will pay additional consideration of $50 million. Preliminary fair values for assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are not reported herein as the Company is still in the process of completing the initial accounting for the acquisition.

Following the completion of the acquisition of Empire City, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and

leases the real property to a subsidiary of the Company. See Note 17 for additional information.

Borgata
acquisition

On  August  1,  2016,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata  for  cash
consideration of $604 million. Following the completion of the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from the Company and
leases  the  real  property  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Additionally,  as  discussed  in  Note  11,  Borgata  subsequently  entered  into  a  property  tax  reimbursement
agreement in February 2017 with the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey and Atlantic City and received the settlement amount of $72
million in June 2017, half of which the Company paid Boyd Gaming, net of fees and expenses.

Through the acquisition  of Boyd Gaming’s interest in Borgata, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests  in Borgata and therefore  consolidated
Borgata  as  of  August  1,  2016.  The  Company  recognized  100%  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Borgata  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Prior  to  the
acquisition,  the  Company  held  a  50%  ownership  interest  in  Borgata,  which  was  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity  interests  of
Borgata  was  determined  by  the  transaction  price  and  equaled  approximately  $1.2  billion.  The  carrying  value  of  the  Company’s  equity  method  investment  was
significantly less than its share of the fair value of Borgata at the acquisition date, resulting in a $430 million gain on the acquisition.

Borgata’s net revenue for the period from August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $350 million, operating income was $34 million and net income

was $4 million.

Differences

The Company’s investments  in unconsolidated  affiliates  do not equal the Company’s share of venture-level  equity due to various basis differences.  Basis
differences  related  to  depreciable  assets  are  being  amortized  based  on  the  useful  lives  of  the  related  assets  and  liabilities,  and  basis  differences  related  to  non–
depreciable assets, such as land and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are not being amortized. Differences between the Company’s share of venture-level equity and
investment balances are as follows:

Goodwill was recognized by MGP, which is included within Corporate and other, in connection with its acquisition of Northfield in 2018. See Note 4 for

discussion of the Northfield Acquisition .

Indefinite-lived
intangible
assets.
The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of development rights in Detroit, gaming and racing

licenses for Northfield, and trademarks and trade names, of which $210 million is related to the Mandalay Resort Group and $83 million is related to Borgata.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
gaming
subconcession.
Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos de
Macau, S.A., a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of
15 years commencing on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms of
the agreement; however, management believes that the gaming subconcession will be extended, given that the Cotai land concession agreement with the government
extends significantly beyond the gaming subconcession. As such, as of December 31, 2018, the Company amortizes the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a
straight-line basis over the initial term of the Cotai land concession, ending in January 2038.

MGM
Macau
land
concession.
MGM Grand Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencing
from  April  6,  2006.  The  land  use  right  has  an  initial  term  through  April  6,  2031,  subject  to  renewal  for  additional  periods.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  land
concession intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial contractual term.

Customer
lists.
 The  Company  recognized  an  intangible  asset  related  to  Northfield’s  customer  list,  which  is  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  its
estimated  useful  life  of  seven  years.  The  Company  also  recognized  intangible  assets  related  to  MGM  China  and  Borgata’s  customer  lists,  which  became  fully
amortized in 2016 and 2018, respectively.

Finite-lived
gaming
licenses.
The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland. The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the
license fee of $22 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of its initial term of 15 years, beginning
in December 2016, when the casino started operations. The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Massachusetts. The consideration paid to the State
of Massachusetts for the license fee of $85 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years, beginning in August
2018, when the casino started operations.

Other.
The Company’s other finite–lived intangible assets consist primarily of lease acquisition costs amortized over the life of the related leases, and certain

license rights amortized over their contractual life.

73

Total  amortization  expense  related  to  intangible  assets  was  $176  million,  $173  million  and  $180  million  for  2018,  2017,  and  2016,  respectively.  As  of

December 31, 2018, estimated future amortization is as follows:

Senior
credit
facility.
 At  December  31,   2018,  the  Company’s  senior  credit  facility  consisted  of  a  $750  million  term  loan  A  facility  and  a  $1.5  billion
revolving facility. In December 2018, the Company amended its senior credit facility to provide for a $250 million increase of the revolving facility to $1.5 billion
and  a  $520  million  increase  on  the  term  loan  A  facility.  Additionally,  the  revolving  and  term  loan  A  facilities  were  repriced  to  LIBOR  plus  1.50%  to  2.25%
determined  by  reference  to  a  total  net  leverage  ratio  pricing  grid  and  the  final  maturity  date  of  the  facilities  was  extended  to  December  2023.  The  term  loan  A
facility’s repayment will start on the last business day of each calendar quarter beginning March 31, 2020, for an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal
amount of the term loan A facility outstanding as of the amendment effective date, with the remaining balance due in December 2023. The Company permanently
repaid  $9  million  of  the  term  loan  A  facility  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2018  in  accordance  with  the  scheduled  amortization.  At  December  31,  2018,  the
interest rate on the term loan A facility was 4.77%. At December 31, 2018, no amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility.

The senior credit facility contains representations and warranties, customary events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that
the Company maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Such
financial covenants will become effective beginning in January 2019.

75

The  senior  credit  facility  is  secured  by  (i)  a  mortgage  on  the  real  properties  comprising  the  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  and  the  Bellagio,  (ii)  a  pledge  of
substantially all existing and future personal property of the subsidiaries of the Company that own the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio; and (iii) a pledge of
the equity or limited liability company interests of the entities that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio.

Mandatory prepayments of the credit facilities will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the

incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights.

Operating
Partnership
senior
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2018, the Operating Partnership’s senior secured credit facility consisted of a $470 million
term loan A facility, a $1.8 billion term loan B facility, and a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility. In March 2018, the Operating Partnership repriced its term loan
B interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.00% and extended the maturity of the term loan B facility to March 2025, which became effective in August 2018.

In June 2018, the Operating Partnership amended its credit agreement to provide for a $750 million increase of the revolving facility to $1.35 billion, a $200
million increase on the term loan A facility, and extensions of the maturities of the revolving facility and the term loan A facility to June 2023. Additionally, the
revolving and term loan A facilities were repriced to LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid. In addition, the
term loan A facility’s repayment will start on the last business day of each calendar quarter beginning September 30, 2019, for an amount equal to 0.625% of the
aggregate principal amount of the term loan A outstanding as of the amendment effective date.

Prior to the amendment, the term loan A facility was subject to amortization in equal quarterly installments of 2.5% of the initial aggregate principal amount
to be payable each year. The Operating Partnership permanently repaid $4 million of the term loan A facility for the year ended December 31, 2018. The term loan B
facility is subject to equal quarterly installments of 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount to be payable each year. The Operating Partnership permanently
repaid $19 million of the term loan B facility for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with the scheduled amortization. At December 31, 2018, $550
million was drawn on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2018, the interest rates on the term loan A facility and the term loan B facility were both 4.52%,
and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 4.43%.

The  Operating  Partnership  credit  facility  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default  and  positive  and  negative  covenants.  The
revolving credit facility and term loan A facility also require the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted
total assets ratio, maximum total net debt to adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit
facility covenants at December 31, 2018.

The Operating Partnership senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of the Operating Partnership’s existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirect
wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, and secured by a first priority lien security interest on substantially all of the Operating Partnership’s and
such restricted subsidiaries’ material assets, including mortgages on its real estate, excluding the real estate assets of MGM National Harbor and Empire City, subject
to customary exclusions.

The Operating Partnership is party to interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. As of December
31,  2018,  the  Operating  Partnership  pays  a  weighted  average  fixed  rate  of  1.844%  on  total  notional  amount  of  $1.2  billion  and  the  variable  rate  received  resets
monthly  to  the  one-month  LIBOR  with  no  minimum  floor.  In  December  2018,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into  additional  interest  rate  swaps  that  have  a
notional amount of $400 million on which it will pay a fixed rate of 2.735% with the variable rate received resetting monthly to the one-month LIBOR with a floor
of 0%. Such interest rate swaps will become effective on December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the derivative financial instruments have been
designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting.

MGM
China
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2018, the MGM China credit facility consisted of $1.8 billion of term loans and a $1.0 billion revolving credit
facility, which bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on HIBOR plus 1.375% to 2.50%, as determined by MGM China’s leverage ratio. In June 2018,
MGM China amended and restated its credit facility for a reduction in the total revolving credit commitments of $450 million to $1.0 billion and an increase in the
total term loan commitments of $450 million to $2.0 billion (the aggregate amount of commitments remained unchanged). The final maturity date was also extended
to June 2022, but no revolving credit loans or term loans shall remain outstanding after, and no revolving credit or term loan commitments shall be available after
March  31,  2022.  Quarterly  principal  amortization  payments  of  the  term  loan  facilities  were  amended  to  be  5%  of  the  original  principal  amount  beginning  in
September 2018 through December 2021, with the remaining balance due in March 2022. MGM China permanently repaid $507 million of term loans for the year
ended  December  31,  2018  in  accordance  with  the  scheduled  amortization.  At  December  31,  2018,  $641  million  was  drawn  on  the  revolving  credit  facility.  At
December 31, 2018, the interest rate on the term loans was 4.74% and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 4.72%.

The  MGM  China  credit  facility  contains  customary  re  presentations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  and  positive,  negative  and  financial  covenants,
including that MGM China maintains compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio . MGM China was in compliance with its
credit facility covenants at December 31, 2018.

Senior
Notes.
In February 2019, the Company repaid its $850 million 8.625% notes due 2019.

In June 2018, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior notes due 2025.

In July 2017, the Company redeemed for cash all $475 million principal amount of its outstanding 11.375% senior notes due 2018. The Company incurred a

$30 million loss on the early retirement of such notes recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.

Operating
Partnership
senior
notes.
 In  September  2017,  the  Operating  Partnership  issued  $350  million  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  4.50%  senior

notes due 2028.

In January 2019, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2027.

Each  series  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  senior  notes  are  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed,  jointly  and  severally,  on  a  senior  basis  by  all  of  the
Operating Partnership’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Operating Partnership’s credit facilities, other than MGP Finance Co-Issuer, Inc., which is a co-issuer of the
senior notes. The Operating Partnership may redeem all or part of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes
plus, to the extent the Operating Partnership is redeeming senior notes prior to the date that is three months prior to their maturity date, an applicable make whole
premium,  plus,  in  each  case,  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  The  indentures  governing  the  senior  notes  contain  customary  covenants  and  events  of  default.  These
covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable indentures governing the senior notes, including, with respect
to the restricted payments covenants, the ability to make unlimited restricted payments to maintain the REIT status of MGP.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that are generally applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, including, but not
limited  to,  (1)  reducing  the  U.S.  federal  corporate  tax  rate  from  35  percent  to  21  percent;  (2)  requiring  companies  to  pay  a  one-time  transition  tax  on  certain
unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) adding a new provision
designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (FTCs) and a deduction of up to 50 percent
to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) imposing additional limitations on the
deductibility of executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits; and (7) increasing bonus depreciation to allow for full expensing of qualified property.

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118
provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To
the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a
provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to
apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.

79

The  Company’s  accounting  for  certain  elements  of  the  Tax  Act  was  incomplete  as  of  December  31,  2017.  However,  the  Company  was  able  to  make
reasonable estimates of certain effects and, therefore, recorded a provisional discrete non-cash net tax benefit of $1.4 billion in the period ended December 31, 2017,
consisting of a benefit of $988 million for the corporate rate reduction and a benefit of $438 million from its provisional re-assessment of the Tax Act’s impact on
the valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers. The Company did not provide tax expense for the transition tax on its unrepatriated earnings,
which totaled $669 million without regard to actual 2017 distributions of $62 million, because such earnings were fully offset by FTCs.

The Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act is now complete. The Company recorded non-cash income tax expense totaling $20 million during
the measurement period in 2018, as it adjusted its valuation allowance on its FTC carryovers to account for guidance clarifying the treatment of FTCs resulting from
GILTI and other provisions impacting FTC utilization. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 3% during the year
ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company finalized its accounting for the tax treatment of indirect costs of providing certain employee fringe benefits
subject to limitation under the Tax Act. This measurement period adjustment had an immaterial impact on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2018.

The Company has made an accounting policy decision to treat taxes due, if any, on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income under the GILTI provisions as a

current period expense when incurred. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a deferred tax liability for any GILTI taxes that may result in future periods.

The  Company  has  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of  $2.4  billion  on  its  FTC  carryover  of  $2.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2018,  resulting  in  an  FTC  net
deferred tax asset of $481 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM
Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming
Tax  qualifies  as  a  tax  paid  in  lieu  of  an  income  tax  that  is  creditable  against  U.S.  taxes.  While  the  Company  generally  does  not  expect  to  generate  new  FTC
carryovers  under the Tax Act, it will be able to utilize  its existing  FTC carryovers  to the extent that it has active  foreign source income during the 10-year FTC
carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of U.S. taxable income, of overall domestic losses that totaled $1.7 billion at
December 31, 2018. The Company relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC
realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $640 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $782
million in 2024; $332 million in 2025; and $196 million in 2027.

The  Company’s  assessment  of  the  realization  of  its  FTC  deferred  tax  asset  is  based  on  available  evidence,  including  assumptions  concerning  future  U.S.
operating profits and our interpretations of the Tax Act based upon guidance issued to date. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible
need for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the
provision for income taxes in the period including such change.

Income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax,  pursuant  to  approval  from  the
Macau government. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $43 million and $38 million in 2018
and 2017, respectively, and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $0.08 and $0.07 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

MGM Grand Paradise has been granted an exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits through March 31, 2020, which is the end
of the term of its current gaming sub-concession. The Company has assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming
profits for all periods beyond March 31, 2020 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Non-gaming  operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  at  December  31,  2018  a  complementary  tax  net
operating loss carryforward of $866 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2019 through
2021.

MGM Grand Paradise’s  exemption  from  the 12% complementary  tax  on gaming  profits  does not apply to dividend distributions  of such profits to MGM
China. However, MGM Grand Paradise has had an agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its
shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount of distributable
dividends. Such annual fee arrangement was effective for distributions of profits earned through December 31, 2016. Since the earnings for 2017 were not covered
by an annual fee arrangement as of December 31, 2017, the Company provided deferred taxes on such earnings, which totaled $41 million as of December 31, 2017.
On March 15, 2018, MGM Grand Paradise executed an extension of the annual fee arrangement,  which covers the distributions of gaming profits earned for the
period of January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2020. It requires annual payments of approximately $1 million for 2017 through 2019 and a payment of approximately
$300,000  for  the  first  quarter  2020.  The  Company  reversed  the  $41  million  of  deferred  taxes  previously  recorded  on  2017  earnings,  resulting  in  a  reduction  in
provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by the 2017 annual payment amount.

80

The Company has net operating losses in certain of the states in which it operates that total $355 million as of December 31, 2018, which equates to deferred
tax assets of $23 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2029 through
2038. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $3 million on certain of its state deferred tax assets, including the net operating losses described above.

In addition, there is a valuation allowance of $26 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong net

operating losses because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $13 million and $11 million at December 31, 2018

and 2017, respectively.

The  Company  recognizes  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  income  tax  expense,  which  were  not  material  as  of  December  31,
2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018 will change materially within the
next twelve months.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income
taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2018, the IRS can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014; however the
IRS  may  adjust  NOLs  generated  in  such  years  that  were  utilized  in  2014.  The  Company’s  2014  U.S.  consolidated  federal  income  tax  return  is  currently  under
examination by the IRS. The IRS examination of the 2014 U.S. income tax return of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership
for income tax purposes was completed during 2018 and the Company’s share of the resultant adjustments were not material in the aggregate.

As of December 31, 2018, other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the various state and local tax jurisdictions in
which the Company files tax returns can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014. However, such jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generated in
such years that are utilized in subsequent years. The Company’s state income tax returns filed in Mississippi and New Jersey for the tax years 2014 through 2016 and
Michigan for the tax years 2014 through 2017 are currently under examination. No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

Leases.
The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases

provide for escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals.

At December 31, 2018, the Company was obligated under non-cancellable operating leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

The  table  above  excludes  the  Company’s  future  lease  obligations  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Operating  Partnership  pursuant  to  the  master  lease  agreement
discussed in Note 17 as these lease obligations are eliminated in consolidation. Rental expense for operating leases was $89 million, $92 million and $80 million for
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which included short-term rentals charged to rent expense. The Company’s operating leases are materially comprised of ground
leases  for  various  properties.  The  Company  accounts  for  the  Cotai  land  concession  contract  as  an  operating  lease  for  which  the  required  upfront  payments  are
amortized over the initial 25-year contract term ending in January 2038.

Additionally, the Company has a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11 acres of land on which the Borgata employee parking garage, public
space expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot reside. The Company recorded an unfavorable lease liability for the excess contractual lease
obligations over the market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. The
remaining balance of the unfavorable lease liability was $46 million and $47 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ground lease is accounted
for as an operating lease.

Also, the Company has a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23-acre parcel of land at MGM National Harbor. The ground lease has an initial term of
25  years  and  the  right  to  extend  for  up  to  13  additional  six-year  periods  with  the  first  7  of  those  additional  periods  considered  to  be  reasonably  assured.  The
Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight-line basis over a 67-year term to December 2082.

October
1
litigation.
The Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017
shooting in Las Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages
for  emotional  distress,  physical  injury,  medical  expenses,  economic  damages  and/or  wrongful  death  based  on  assertions  that  the  Company  and/or  certain  of  its
subsidiaries  were  negligent.  The  Company  also  received  letters  from  attorneys  purporting  to  represent  other  persons  with  claims  related  to  the  October  1,  2017
shooting.  Lawsuits  were  first  filed  in  October  2017  and  include  actions  filed  by  multiple  individuals  in  the  District  Court  of  Clark  County,  Nevada  and  in  the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. Some of the original actions have been voluntarily dismissed, and plaintiffs’ counsel indicate they anticipate re-
filing  the  lawsuits  in  similar  form.  In  June  2018, the  Company  removed  to  federal  court  all  actions  that  remained  pending  in  California  and  Nevada  state  courts
following the voluntary dismissals. Motions to remand have been filed in several cases, and the Company anticipates that there may be additional motions to remand
filed in the future. The Company also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to
sue. Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. In February of 2019, the Company and plaintiffs’ counsel commenced mediation of these
matters.  The above-described litigation currently is stayed pending mediation.

The Company is currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future
litigation related to this matter. The Company will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new
information and future circumstances. The Company intends to defend against these lawsuits and ultimately believes it should prevail, but litigation of this type is
inherently unpredictable. Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect the Company’s belief as to
the possibility of liability, the Company currently believes that it is reasonably possible that it could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The
foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability
on the part of the Company or any of its affiliates. Given that these cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, the Company does
not  currently  possess  sufficient  information  to  determine  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  liability.  In  the  event  the  Company  incurs  any  liability,  the  Company
believes  it  is  unlikely  it  would  incur  losses  in  connection  with  these  claims  in  excess  of  its  insurance  coverage.  The  insurance  carriers  have  not  expressed  a
reservation  of  rights  or  coverage  defense  that  affects  the  Company’s  evaluation  of  potential  losses  in  connection  with  these  claims.  In  addition,  the  Company’s
general  liability  insurance  coverage  provides,  as  part  of  the  contractual  “duty  to  defend”,  payment  of  legal  fees  and  associated  costs  incurred  to  defend  covered
lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and not limited by) the limits of the
insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available.

Other
litigation
.
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routi ne matters incidental to its business. Management does

not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows .

Borgata
property
tax
reimbursement
agreement.
On February 15, 2017, Borgata, the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey and
Atlantic City entered into an agreement wherein Borgata was to be reimbursed $72 million as settlement for property tax refunds in satisfaction of New Jersey Tax
Court and Superior Court judgments totaling approximately $106 million, plus interest for the 2009-2012 tax years and the settlement of pending tax appeals for the
tax years 2013-2015. Those pending tax appeals could potentially have resulted in Borgata being awarded additional refunds due of approximately $65 million. In
June  2017,  Atlantic  City  and  the  State  of  New  Jersey  issued  bonds  and  used  the  proceeds  to  pay  the  $72  million  settlement  in  full.  The  Company  recorded  the
amounts  received  pursuant  to  the  reimbursement  agreement  as  an  offset  to  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  As
required by the purchase and sale agreement to acquire Borgata in August 2016, the Company paid Boyd Gaming half of the settlement  amount received by the
Company,  net  of  fees  and  expenses.  Amounts  paid  to  Boyd  Gaming  were  recorded  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of
operations.

NV
Energy.
In July 2016, the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and now purchases energy, capacity, and/or
ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. The Company paid an upfront impact payment of $83 million, including $14 million related to CityCenter,
in September 2016. Under the terms of the exit agreement, the Company and CityCenter were required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy for non-bypassable
rate charges, which primarily relate to each entity’s share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extended through 2040 and each entity’s
share  of  the  costs  of  decommissioning  and  remediation  of  coal-fired  power  plants  in  Nevada.  The  Company’s  initial  estimate  of  its  obligation  related  to  non-
bypassable  charges  was  $71  million.  The  expense  recognized  related  to  the  upfront  payment  and  the  initial  accrual  for  the  liability  associated  with  the  non-
bypassable charges was recorded within “NV Energy exit expense” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Subsequent accretion of the liability and changes in estimates are recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
In the second quarter of 2017, the terms of the ongoing impact fee obligations were modified. Such modifications included a credit to be applied against future non-
bypassable rate charges and substantially shortened the period over which the Company and CityCenter are responsible for such charges, with an end date in 2022.
As  such,  the  Company  recognized  a  reduction  in  its  liability  for  future  charges  of  $41  million  with  a  corresponding  credit  to  “NV  Energy  exit  expense”.
Additionally,  CityCenter  recorded  an  $8  million  reduction  in  liability  and  credit  to  expense.  As  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017,  the  Company  has  recorded  an
estimate of its remaining liability on a discounted basis of $8 million and $10 million, respectively, in “Other accrued liabilities” and $15 million and $23 million,
respectively, in “Other long-term obligations.”

Grand
Paradise
Macau
deferred
cash
payment.
 On  September  1,  2016,  the  Company  purchased  188.1  million  common  shares  of  its  MGM  China
subsidiary  from  Grand  Paradise  Macau  (“GPM”),  an  entity  controlled  by  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Ho”).  As  part  of  the  consideration  for  the
purchase, the Company agreed to pay GPM or its nominee a deferred cash payment of $50 million, which will be paid in amounts equal to the ordinary dividends
received on such shares, with a final lump sum payment due on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction if any portion of the deferred cash payment
remains unpaid at that time. In 2018 and 2017, the total amount paid under the deferred cash payment arrangement was $11 million and $7 million, respectively.
Such  amount  was  paid  to  Expert  Angles  Limited,  an  entity  controlled  by  Ms.  Ho  through  November  2018  and  subsequently  controlled  by  an  immediate  family
member of Ms. Ho. As of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a remaining liability on a discounted basis of $36 million in “Other long-term obligations.”

Other
guarantees.
 The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  various  guarantee  contracts  in  the  normal  course  of  business,  which  are  generally
supported by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $250
million, the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility limits the amount to $75 million, and MGM China’s credit facility limits the amount to $100 million. At
December  31, 2018,  $12  million  in  letters  of  credit  were  outstanding  under  the  Company’s  senior  credit  facility.  No  letters  of  credit  were  outstanding  under  the
Operating  Partnership  senior  credit  facility  or  MGM  China’s  credit  facility  at  December  31,  2018.  The  amount  of  available  borrowings  under  each  of  the  credit
facilities is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.

stock
repurchase
program.
 In  May  2018,  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors  authorized  a  $2.0  billion  stock  repurchase
program  and  completed  the  previously  announced  $1.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program.  Under  each  stock  repurchase  program,  the  Company  may  repurchase
shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which
would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and
nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be
suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 41 million shares at an average purchase price of $31.25 per share for
an aggregate amount of $1.3 billion. Repurchased shares were retired. The remaining availability under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program was approximately
$1.4 billion as of December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 10 million shares at $32.75 per share for a total aggregate amount of $328 million.

Repurchased shares were retired.

Multiemployer
benefit
plans.
The Company currently participates in multiemployer pension plans in which the risks of participating differs from single-

employer plans in the following aspects:

a) Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;
b)
c)

If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers;
If  an  entity  chooses  to  stop  participating  in  some  of  its  multiemployer  plans,  the  entity  may  be  required  to  pay  those  plans  an  amount  based  on  the
underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability; and
If  the  plan  is  terminated  by  withdrawal  of  all  employers  and  if  the  value  of  the  nonforfeitable  benefits  exceeds  plan  assets  and  withdrawal  liability
payments, employers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference.

The Company was listed  in the plan's Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years 2017 and 2016 for the Southern Nevada Culinary and
Bartenders Pension Plan and for the plan year 2016 for the NRF. At the date the financial statements were issued, Form 5500 was not available for the plan year 2018.
The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded
(critical status) and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.
Indicates plans for which a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) or a Rehabilitation Plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented.
There have been no significant  changes that  affect the comparability  of contributions,  other than those for the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund (“UHF”), formally known as the
Legacy Plan of the National Retirement Fund (“NRF”) prior to January 1, 2018, which reflect the period from acquisition of Borgata of August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016
within the 2016 column and a full-year of contributions within the 2018 and 2017 columns.
The  Company  is  party  to  ten  collective  bargaining  agreements  (CBA)  that  require  contributions  with  the  Local  Joint  Executive  Board  of  Las  Vegas,  which  is  made  up  of  the
Culinary and Bartenders Unions. The agreements between CityCenter Hotel Casino, LLC, Bellagio, Mandalay Corp., and MGM Grand Hotel, LLC are the most significant because
more than half of the Company’s employee participants in this plan are covered by those four agreements.
In December 2017, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved the spin-off of the UNITE HERE portion of the NRF to the plan of a newly-formed Legacy Plan of the
UNITE HERE Retirement Fund. As a result of the spin-off, the pension liabilities as well as certain assets of the plan were transferred to the new Plan. The terms of the Plan are
identical to the NRF. The spin-off was effective as of January 1, 2018.

million, and $187 million to the Health Fund in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Self-insurance.
The  Company  is  self-insured  for  most  health  care  benefits  and  workers  compensation  for  its  non-union  employees.  The  liability  for  self-

insurance was $93 million and $87 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is included in “Other accrued liabilities.”

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic
characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting
structure. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company changed its reportable segments to Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. This
change of reportable segments reflects realignment within the Company stemming from the expansion of the Company’s regional operations.

Las
Vegas
Strip
Resorts.
  Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature),
Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las
Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas.

Regional
Operations.
 Regional  Operations  consists  of  the  following  casino  resorts:  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,
Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; and
MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts (upon commencing operations in August 2018).

MGM
China.
  MGM China consists of MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (upon commencing operations in February 2018).

The  Company’s  operations  related  to  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  MGP’s  Northfield  casino,  and  certain  other  corporate  operations  and
management services have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following
segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

The Company’s management utilizes Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments. Adjusted Property EBITDA is a
measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. Adjusted EBITDA is a
measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV
Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, and property transactions, net.

The  following  tables  present  the  Company’s  segment  information.  As  a  result  of  the  change  in  reportable  segments  described  above,  we  have  recast

entity included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in which Ms. Ho indirectly holds a noncontrolling interest, is party to a brand license agreem ent
and  a  development  services  agreement  with  MGM  China,  for  which  the  related  amounts  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  An  entity  owned  by  Ms.  Ho  received

MGP

As further described in Note 1, pursuant to the master lease, the tenant leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New

York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata and MGM National Harbor from the landlord.

The master lease has an initial lease term of ten years that began on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below)
with the potential to extend the term for four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the tenant. The master lease provides that any extension of its term
must apply to all of the real estate under the master lease at the time of the extension. The master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the tenant to pay
substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the
master lease provides the landlord with a right of first offer with respect to MGM Springfield, which the landlord may exercise should the Company elect to sell this
property in the future. In connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, the master lease was amended to provide that the initial term with respect to MGM
National Harbor ends on April 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the
tenant for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether the
Company elects to renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year term). If, however, the tenant chooses
not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the master lease, the tenant would also lose the right
to renew the master lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026.

In connection with the commencement of the third lease year on April 1, 2018, annual rent payments under the master lease increased to $770 million from
$757  million.  Rent  under  the  master  lease  consists  of  a  “base  rent”  component  and  a  “percentage  rent”  component.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  base  rent
represents approximately 90% of the rent payments due under the master lease and the percentage rent represents approximately 10% of the rent payments due under
the master lease. The master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of 2% on the base rent through the sixth lease year and the possibility for additional 2%
increases thereafter subject to the tenant meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every five
years thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period calculated in accordance with the terms under the
master lease. The master lease also contains customary events of default and financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as
of December 31, 2018.

Subsequent to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire
City  from  the  Company  for  consideration  of  approximately  $634  million.  The  real  estate  assets  of  Empire  City  will  be  leased  to  the  Company  pursuant  to  an
amendment to the master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the master
lease terms, 90 percent of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2 percent per year until 2022. In addition, the master lease provides the landlord with a
right  of  first  offer  with  respect  to  certain  undeveloped  land  adjacent  to  the  property  to  the  extent  the  Company  develops  additional  gaming  facilities,  which  the
landlord may exercise should the Company elect to sell this property in the future.

Additionally, in September 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with MGP to acquire Northfield OpCo from MGP for approximately $275
million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The real estate assets of Northfield will be leased to the Company pursuant to an amendment to the master
lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $60 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90 percent of
this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2 percent per year until 2022. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary
closing conditions.

Also,  in  December  2018,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  MGP  whereby  MGP  will  pay  the  Company  consideration  of  $638  million  for
renovations undertaken by the Company regarding the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). Additionally, at closing,
the parties will enter into an amendment to the master lease whereby the annual rent payment to MGP will increase by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the
lease year. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022. The transaction is expected to
close in the first quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions.

91

All  intercompany  transactions,  including  transactions  under  the  master  lease,  have  been  eliminated  in  the  Company’s  consolidation  of  MGP.  The  public

ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized as non-controlling interests in the Com pany’s consolidated financial statements.

—CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATING
FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

As of December 31, 2018, all of the Company’s principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of its material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGP
and  the  Operating  Partnership,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  MGM  National  Harbor,  MGM  Springfield,  and  each  of  their  respective  subsidiaries.  The  Company’s
international subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are not guarantors of such indebtedness. Separate condensed financial statement information
for  the  subsidiary  guarantors  and  non-guarantors  as  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017  and  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  are  presented
below. Within the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows, the Company has presented net changes in intercompany accounts as investing activities if
the applicable entities have a net asset in intercompany accounts and as a financing activity if the applicable entities have a net intercompany liability balance.

Certain  of  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  collectively  own  Operating  Partnership  units  and  each  subsidiary  accounts  for  its  respective  investment  under  the
equity  method  within  the  condensed  consolidating  financial  information  presented  below.  For  these  subsidiaries,  such  investment  constitutes  continuing
involvement, and accordingly, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the master lease do not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. The real estate
assets are reflected in the balance sheets of the applicable MGM subsidiaries. In addition, such subsidiaries recognized finance liabilities within “Other long-term
obligations” related to rent payments due under the master lease and recognized the related interest expense component of such payments. These real estate assets are
also reflected on the balance sheet of the MGP subsidiary that received such assets. The condensed consolidating financial information presented below therefore
includes the accounting for such activity within the respective columns presented and in the elimination column. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the
Company  is  reassessing  whether  the  sale  and  leaseback  of  the  real  estate  assets  under  the  master  lease  now  qualify  as  a  passed  sale  and,  accordingly,  the
corresponding lease classification, both of which could impact the condensed consolidating financial information.

Disclosure
Controls
and
Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”)) were effective as of
December  31,  2018  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  reports  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,
processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the time  periods  specified  in the  SEC rules  and regulations  and  to  provide  that  such  information  is accumulated  and
communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. This conclusion is based on an evaluation as required by Rules 13a-15(b)
and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act conducted under the supervision and participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer along with
company management.

Management’s
Annual
Report
on
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

Management’s
Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)

of the Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
of
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

In  establishing  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  management  has  developed  and  maintained  a  system  of  internal  control,  policies  and
procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  contained  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information
presented in this annual report is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this annual report. These include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer
and  principal  financial  officer,  as  appropriate  for  all  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  Significant  elements  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting include, for example:

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them appropriately;

•
• Written accounting policies;
• Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;
•
•
•

Segregation of incompatible duties;
Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control; and
Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Management’s
Evaluation

Management,  with  the  participation  of  the  Company’s  principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer,  has  evaluated  the  Company’s  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  using  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2018, management believes that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in achieving

the objectives described above.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm’s report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting appears herein.

 (the  "Specified  Term"),  unless  a  new  written  employment  agreement  is  executed  by  the  parties.  If
Employee remains employed after the expiration of the Specified Term, and the parties do not execute a new employment
agreement,  then  Employee  shall  be  employed  at-will
 and  none  of  the  provisions  of  the  Agreement  shall  apply  to
Employee’s  continued  employment  at-will,  except  Sections  8,  10.5,  11  and  12,  and  Employer  shall  have  the  right  to

provided herein) without any payment of severance or compensation.

Compensation .    During  the  first  and  second  year  of  Specified  Term,  Employer  shall  pay  Employee  a  minimum  annual

for  consideration  for  a  discretionary  raise,  promotion,  and/or  participation  in  discretionary  benefit  plans;  provided,

During the Specified Term, it is anticipated that Employee will be required to travel extensively on
behalf of Employer.  Such travel, if by air, may be on aircraft provided by Employer (if authorized

Extent of Services .  Employee agrees that Employee’s  employment  by Employer is full time and exclusive.   Employee
further agrees to perform Employee’s duties in a competent, trustworthy and businesslike manner.   Employee agrees that
during the Specified Term, Employee will not render any services of any kind (whether or not for compensation) for any
person or entity other than Employer, and that Employee will not engage in any other business activity (whether or not for
compensation)  that  is  similar  to  or  conflicts  with  Employee’s  duties  under  this  Agreement,  without  the  approval  of  the
Board  of  Directors  of  MGM  Resorts  International  or  the  person  or  persons  designated  by  the  Board  of  Directors  to
determine such matters.

Policies  and  Procedures  .    Employee  agrees  and  acknowledges  that  Employee  is  bound  by  Employer’s  policies  and
procedures as they may be modified, amended or adopted by Employer from time to time, including, but not limited to, the
Company’s  Code  of  Conduct  and  Conflict  of  Interest  policies.    In  the  event  the  terms  in  this  Agreement  conflict  with
Employer’s policies and procedures, the terms of this Agreement shall take precedence.  As Employee is aware, problem
gaming and underage gambling can have adverse effects on individuals and the gaming industry as a whole.  Employee
acknowledges  that  Employee  has  read  and  is  familiar  with  Employer’s  policies,  procedures  and  manuals  and  agrees  to
abide by them.  Because these matters are of such importance to Employer, Employee specifically confirms that Employee
is familiar with and will comply with Employer’s policies of prohibiting underage gaming, supporting programs to treat
compulsive gambling, and promoting diversity in all aspects of Employer’s business.

Licensing Requirements .  Employee acknowledges that Employer is engaged in a business that is or may be subject to and
exists  because  of  privileged  licenses  issued  by  governmental  authorities  in  Nevada,  Michigan,  Mississippi,  Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Macau S.A.R., and other jurisdictions in

2

which Employer is engaged in a gaming business or where Employer ha s applied to (or during the Specified Term may
apply to) engage in a gaming business.   Employee shall apply for and obtain any license, qualification, clearance or other
similar  approval  which  Employer or  any  regulatory  authority  which  has  jurisdiction  over  Employer requests or requires
that Employee obtain.

7.

Failure  to  Satisfy  Licensing  Requirement  .    Employer  has  the  right  to  terminate  Employee’s  employment  under  Section
10.1  of  this  Agreement  if:  (i)  Employee  fails  to  satisfy  any  licensing  requirement  referred  to  in  Section  6  above;
(ii) Employer is directed to cease business with Employee by any governmental authority referred to in Section 6 above;
(iii) Employer determines, in its sole and exclusive judgment, that Employee was, is or might be involved in, or are about
to  be  involved  in,  any  activity,  relationship(s)  or  circumstance  which  could  or  does  jeopardize  Employer’s  business,
reputation  or  such  licenses;  or  (iv)  any  of  Employer’s  licenses  is  threatened  to  be,  or  is,  denied,  curtailed,  suspended  or
revoked as a result of Employee’s employment by Employer or as a result of Employee’s actions.

8.

Restrictive Covenants .

Employee  acknowledges  that,  in  the  course  of  performing  Employee’s  responsibilities  under  this  Agreement,  Employee
will form relationships and become acquainted with “Confidential Information” (defined below in Section 22).  Employee
further acknowledges that such relationships and the Confidential Information are valuable to Employer and the Company,
and  the  restrictions  on  Employee’s  future  employment  contained  in  this  Agreement,  if  any,  are  reasonably  necessary  in
order  for  Employer  to  remain  competitive  in  Employer’s  various  businesses  and  to  prevent  Employee  from  engaging  in
unfair competition against Employer after termination of Employee’s employment with Employer for any reason.

In consideration of this Agreement and the compensation payable to Employee under this Agreement, and in recognition of
Employer’s  heightened  need  for  protection  from  abuse  of  relationships  formed  or  disclosure  and  misuse  of  Confidential
Information garnered before and during the Specified Term of this Agreement, Employee covenants and agree as follows:

8.1

Competition  .    Except  as  otherwise  explicitly  provided  in  Paragraph  10  of  this  Agreement,  during  the  entire
Specified  Term  and  thereafter  for  the  “Restrictive  Period”  (defined  below  in  Section  22)  Employee  shall  not
directly  or  indirectly  be  employed  by,  provide  consultation  or  other  services  to,  engage  in,  participate  in  or
otherwise be connected in any way with any “Competitor” (defined below in Section 22) in any capacity that is
the same, substantially the same or similar to the position or capacity (irrespective of title or department) as that
held at any time during Employee’s employment with Employer; provided, however, that if

3

Employee  remains  employed  at-will  by  Employer  after  expiration  of  the  Specified  Term  and  is  thereafter
separated  by  Employer  during  the  Restrictive  Period  for  any  reason  other  than  “Employer’s  Good  Cause”
(defined below in Section 22) , Employee shall not be subject to this Section 8.1 .

8.2

benefit of a third party (or induce, encourage or assist others in doing any of the foregoing acts) any Company
Group  "Trade  Secrets"  (as  defined  in  Section  22)  for  any  purpose  whatsoever.    Further,  at  all  times  during
Employee's employment with the Company, and for 12 months thereafter, Employee will not, without the prior
written consent of Company:

(a)

(b)

(c)

or entice any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Company Group or
end  his/her  employment  with  Company  Group,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of
Company,  in  each  and  every  instance,  such  consent  to  be  within  Company's  sole  and
absolute discretion.

8.3

Confidentiality .    At  all  times  during  Employee's  employment  with  the  Company,  and  at  all  times  thereafter,
Employee  shall  not,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief
Operating Officer or General Counsel in each and every instance--such consent to be within the Company's sole
and absolute discretion--use, disclose or make known to any person, entity or other third party outside of the
Company Group any Confidential Information belonging to Company Group or its individual members.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 8.3 shall not apply to Confidential Information: (i) that
is  required  to  be  disclosed  by  law  or  by  any  court,  arbitrator,  mediator  or  administrative  or  legislative  body
(including any committee thereof) in any litigation, arbitration,

4

8.4

8.5

mediation  or  legislative  hearing,  with  jurisdiction  to  order  Employee  to  disclose  or  make  accessible  any

of such disclosure to enable Company to seek a protective order or other relief to protect the confidentiality of
such Confidential Information; (ii) that becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or
industry  other  than  due  to  Employee's  or  any  third  party's  violation  of  this  Agreement  or  other  obligation  of

legally entitled to disclose it to Employee.

in  the  future  will  receive,  from  third  parties,  their  confidential  or  proprietary  information  subject  to a duty  to
maintain  the  confidentiality  of  such  information  and  to  use  it  only  for  certain  limited  purposes.    At  all  times
during  Employee's  employment  with  the  Company,  whether  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  or  at-will,  and  at  all
times  thereafter,  Employee  shall  hold  any  and  all  such  third  party  confidential  or  proprietary  information  of
third parties in the strictest confidence and will not intentionally or negligently disclose it to any person or entity
or to use it except as necessary in carrying out Employee's duties and obligations hereunder consistent with the
Company  Group's  agreement  with  such  third  party.    Employee  shall  not  be  in  violation  of  Employee's
obligations hereunder if such third party confidential or proprietary information is already generally known to
the public through no wrongful act of Employee or any other party.

Acknowledgement  of  Ownership  of  Confidential  Information  Property  Acquired  or  Developed  During
Employment; Non-Transfer .  Employee understands, agrees, and hereby confirms that Employee's duties and
responsibilities  include  acquiring  Confidential  Information  and  developing  Relationships  for  the  benefit  of

property of Company, regardless of whether the information qualifies for protection as a Trade Secret.

Employee  further  understands,  agrees,  and  hereby  confirms  that  during  Employee's  employment,  Employee
shall  not,  at  any  time  or  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  except  upon  the  express  written  authorization  of  the

device or in any form or format except on devices and in such formats as expressly approved and issued by the
Company to Employee.  By way of example, and without limitation,

5

document,  paper,  computer,  tablet,  Blackberry,  cellular  phone,  personal  mobile  device,  Blackberry,  iPhone,
iPad, thumb drive, smart phone memory, zip drive or disk, flash drive, external drive or any other similar device
used for storing or recording data of any kind (the "Devices") unless such Device is issued by the Company to

Employee's use of such Device.

Return of Confidential Information . Upon termination of Employee's employment for any reason at any time,
Employee shall immediately return to the Company, and retain no copies of, any all Confidential Information in

does not possess any Confidential Information of Company in contravention of this Agreement.

Acknowledgement  of  Copyrights  in  and  to  Compilations  of  Confidential  Information  .    Employee
acknowledges  that  Company  owns copyrights  in  any  and  all  compilations  of  Confidential  Information  in  any
tangible  or  electronic  form  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  printed  lists,  handwritten  lists,  spreadsheets,  and
databases)  in  any  storage  media,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  Devices,    (collectively,  “Copyrighted
Works”).  Employee further acknowledges that unauthorized copying, distributing, or creating derivative works,
or  inducing  or  contributing  to  such  conduct  by  others,  based  on  such  Copyrighted  Works  constitutes
infringement of Company's copyrights in and to the Copyrighted Works.  Employee acknowledges that only the

to  grant  authorization  to  Employee  to  copy,  distribute  or  create  derivative  works  based  on  the  Copyrighted

distribution  or  creation  of derivative  works  by Employee.   Employee  acknowledges  that  federal  law  provides
for civil liability and criminal penalties for copyright infringement.  Employee agrees not to challenge, contest
or  dispute  Company's  right,  title  and  interest  in  the  Copyrighted  Works  and  waives  any  legal  or  equitable
defense to infringement of such Copyrighted Works.

Employee hereby represents and warrants to Company, and hereby agrees with
Company, as follows:

9.1

9.2

9.3

9.4

9.5

9.6

A portion of Employee's compensation and consideration under this Agreement is (i) Company's agreement to
employ  Employee;  (ii)  Employee's  agreement  that  the  covenants  contained  in  Sections  4  and  8  hereof  are
reasonable, appropriate and suitable in their geographic scope, duration and content; (iii) Employee's agreement
that  Employee  shall  not,  directly  or  indirectly,  raise  any  issue  of  the  reasonableness,  appropriateness  and
suitability of the geographic scope, duration or content of such covenants and agreements in any proceeding to
enforce such covenants and agreements;  (iv) Employee's agreement that such covenants and agreements  shall
survive the termination of this Agreement, in accordance with their terms; and (v) the free and full assignability
by  Company  of  such  covenants  and  agreements  upon  a  sale,  reorganization  or  other  transaction  of  any  kind
relating to the ownership and/or control of Company Group or its members or assigns.

The  enforcement  of  any  remedy  under  this  Agreement  will  not  prevent  Employee  from  earning  a  livelihood,
because Employee's past work history and abilities are such that Employee can reasonably expect to find work
irrespective of the covenants and agreements contained in Section 8 hereof.

The  covenants  and  agreements  stated  in  Sections  4,  6,  7,  and  8  hereof  are  essential  for  the  Company's
reasonable protection of its Trade Secrets, Business Contacts, and Confidential Information.

The  Company  has  reasonably  relied  on  Employee's  covenants,  representations  and  agreements  in  this
Agreement.

Employee has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform Employee's duties
and  obligations  hereunder,  and  the  entering  into  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  by  Employee  will  not
violate or conflict with any arrangements or other agreements Employee may have or agreed to have with any
other person or entity.

Employee  acknowledges  that  the  Company  has  and  will  continue  to  invest  substantial  time  and  expense  in
developing and protecting Confidential Information, all of which Employee expressly understands and agrees
belongs  solely  and  exclusively  to  Company.    Employee  further  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  because  the
Company  Group  has  and  will  continue  to  invest  substantial  time  and  expense  in  developing  and  protecting
Confidential Information, that any loss of or damage to the

7

Company as a result of a breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in Sections
4 and 8 hereof, the Company will suffer irreparable harm.  Consequently, Employee covenants and agrees that
any  viola  tion  by  Employee  of  Sections  4  or  8  of  this  Agreement  shall  entitle  the  Company  to  immediate
injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of posting any bond or waiving any
claim for damages.  Employee further covenants and agrees that Employee will not contest the enforceability of
such an injunction in any state or country in which such an injunction is not, itself, a violation of law.

specifically provided in Sections 10.2.4 and 10.3.4 with respect to the undertaking contained in Section 8.1, the
covenants and agreements contained in Section 8 shall survive a termination of this Agreement or the cessation
of Employee’s employment to the extent and for the period provided for in Section 8, regardless of the reason
for such termination.

Arbitration .  Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and in Exhibit B to this Agreement (which constitutes a
material provision of this Agreement), any controversy, dispute or claim directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this  Agreement,  or  the  breach  thereof,  or  arising  out  of  or  relating  to  the  employment  of  Employee,  or  the  termination
thereof, shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to Exhibit B.

Disputed  Claim  .  In  the  event  of  any  “Disputed  Claim”  (defined  below  in  Section  22),  such  Disputed  Claim  shall  be
resolved  by  binding  arbitration  pursuant  to  Exhibit  B.    Unless  and  until  the  arbitration  process  for  a  Disputed  Claim  is
finally resolved in Employee’s favor and Employer thereafter fails to satisfy such award within thirty (30) days of its entry,
Employee  shall not have affected  an Employee’s  Good Cause termination  and Employee  shall not have any termination
rights pursuant to Section 10.3 with respect to such Disputed Claim.  Nothing herein shall preclude or prohibit Company
from invoking the provisions of Section 10.2, or of Company seeking or obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief.

Severability .If any section, provision, paragraph, phrase, word, and/or line (collectively, “Provision”) of this Agreement is
declared to be unenforceable, then this Agreement will be deemed retroactively modified to the extent necessary to render
the  otherwise  unenforceable  Provision,  and  the  rest  of  the  Agreement,  valid  and  enforceable.    If  a  court  or  arbitrator
declines  to  modify  this  Agreement  as  provided  herein,  the  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of  any  Provision  of  this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining Provisions.  This Section 13 does not limit our
rights  to  seek  damages  or  such  additional  relief  as  may  be  allowed  by  law  and/or  equity  in  respect  to  any  breach  by
Employee of the enforceable provisions of this Agreement.

No  Waiver  of  Breach  or  Remedies  .    No  failure  or  delay  on  the  part  of  Employee  or  Employer  in  exercising  any  right,
power  or  remedy  hereunder  shall  operate  as  a  waiver  thereof  nor  shall  any  single  or  partial  exercise  of  any  such  right,
power  or  remedy  preclude  any  other  or  further  exercise  thereof  or  the  exercise  of  any  other  right,  power  or  remedy
hereunder.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

Amendment  or  Modification  .    No  amendment,  modification,  termination  or  waiver  of  any  provision  of  this  Agreement
shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Employee and a duly authorized member of Employer’s
senior management.  No consent to any departure by Employee from any of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective
unless the same is signed by a duly authorized  member of Employer’s  senior management.  Any such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

24.4

This Agreement is intended to comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of Internal Revenue
Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  and  any  regulations  and  Treasury  guidance  promulgated  thereunder
(“Section  409A”).    If  Employer  determines  in  good  faith  that  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  would  cause
Employee to incur an additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section 409A, the Compensation Committee and
Employee shall use reasonable efforts to reform such provision, if possible, in a mutually agreeable fashion to
maintain to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the
provisions of Section 409A or causing the imposition of such additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section
409A.  The preceding provisions, however, shall not be construed as a guarantee by Employer of any particular
tax effect to Employee under this Agreement.

“Termination of employment,” or words of similar import, as used in this Agreement means, for purposes of
any  payments  under  this  Agreement  that  are  payments  of  deferred  compensation  subject  to  Section  409A,
Employee’s “separation from service” as defined in Section 409A.

For  purposes  of  Section  409A,  the  right  to  a  series  of  installment  payments  under  this  Agreement  shall  be
treated as a right to a series of separate payments.

With  respect  to  any  reimbursement  of  Employee’s  expenses,  or  any  provision  of  in-kind  benefits  to  you,  as
specified  under  this  Agreement,  such  reimbursement  of  expenses  or  provision  of  in-kind  benefits  shall  be
subject  to  the  following  conditions:  (1)  the  expenses  eligible  for  reimbursement  or  the  amount  of  in-kind
benefits provided in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of
in-kind  benefits  provided  in  any  other  taxable  year,  except  for  any  medical  reimbursement  arrangement
providing for the reimbursement of expenses referred to in Section 105(b) of the Code; (2) the reimbursement
of an eligible expense shall be made pursuant to Employer’s reimbursement policy but no later than the end of
the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (3) the right to reimbursement or

17

25.

in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

24.5

If a payment obligation under this Agreement that constitutes a payment of “deferred compensation” (as defined
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation
Sections  1.409A-1(b)(3)  through  (b)(12))  arises  on  account  of  Employee’s  separation  from  service  while
Employee is a “specified employee” (as defined under Section 409A), any payment thereof that is scheduled to
be paid within six (6) months after such separation from service shall accrue without interest and shall be paid
within 15 days after the end of the six-month period beginning on the date of such separation from service or, if
earlier, within 15 days following your death.

Ownership  of  Intellectual  Property  .    Employee  expressly  acknowledges  that  all  trademarks,  trade  dress,  copyrightable
works,  patentable  inventions,  ideas,  new  or  novel  inventions,  concepts,  systems,  methods  of  operation,  improvements,
strategies, techniques, trade secrets including, but not limited to, customers (including, but not limited to, customer names,
contact  information,  historical  and/or  theoretical  play,  or  other  information,  and  the  right  to  market  to  such  customers),
data of any type or nature and regardless of the form or media, as well as all materials of any type of nature that comprise,
reflect or embody any of the foregoing including, without limitation, databases, software, artistic works, advertisements,
brochures,  marketing  plans,  customer  lists,  memoranda,  business  plans,  and  proposals  (collectively,  “Intellectual
Property”)  created,  conceived,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  otherwise  obtained,  in  whole  or  in  part  by  the  Employee
during the term of [his/her] employment by Employer shall at all times be owned by Employer (and is hereby expressly
assigned by Employee to Employer) if the Intellectual Property: (a) was created, conceived, developed, or contributed to:
(1)  using  any  of  Employer’s  property  or  resources;  (2)  on  Employer’s  premises;  or  (3)  during  Employee’s  hours  of
employment;  or  (b)  relates  to  Employee’s  employment  by  Employer,  even  though  creation  of  such  Intellectual  Property
was not within the scope of Employee’s duties and responsibilities for which the Employer employs the Employee.  All
works  of  authorship  created  by  Employee  within  the  scope  of  this  provision  shall  be  deemed  works  made  for  hire  as
defined  in  the  Copyright  Act  of  1976,  17  U.S.C.  §  101  .      To  the  extent  such  works  are  deemed  not  to  be  works  of
authorship, Employee hereby irrevocably assigns (or authorizes Employer to act as Employee’s agent to assign) all right,
title  and  interest  in  and  to  the  copyrights  in  the  works,  including,  without  limitation,  right  of  attribution  and  all  related
moral  rights,  to  the  Employer.    Employee  further  agrees  that  any  inventions  and  trade  secrets  covered  by  this  provision
shall  be  owned  absolutely  and  exclusively  by  Employer,  including  all  patent  rights  throughout  the  world.  Employee
acknowledges  that  this  provision  provides  Employer  with  rights  greater  than  provided  under  certain  applicable  laws
including, without limitation, Nevada Revised Statutes § 600.500.  Employee shall promptly inform Employer about

18

such patentable inventions and shall not disclose to any third parties any information about the inventions without the prior
written consent of Employer. Employee agrees to execute and deliver to Employer, upon request, such documents as may
be necessary for Employer to perfect its rights in any and all Intellectual Property covered by this provision.  To fulfill the
intent of this paragraph, Employee irrevocably appoints Employer and Employer’s authorized agents as his/her agent and
attorney in fact to transfer, vest or confirm Employer’s rights and to execute and file any such applications and to do all
other lawful acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters, patents or trademark or copyright registrations with the
same legal force as if done by Employee, in all instances in which Employer is unable for any reason to secure Employee’s
personal signature.  Employee shall not be entitled to any compensation or other consideration for any Intellectual Property
covered by this provision.

26.         Certain Protections .

26.1

Employee  understands  that  nothing  contained  in this Agreement  limits or otherwise  prohibits  Employee  from
filing  a  charge  or  complaint  with  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission,  the  National  Labor
Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission
or any other  federal,  state or local  governmental  agency  or commission  ("Government  Agencies").  Employee
further  understands  that  this  Agreement  does  not  limit  Employee’s  ability  to  communicate  with  any
Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any
Government  Agency,  including  providing  documents  or  other  information  (subject  to  paragraph  26.2  below),
without  notice  to  the  Employer.  This  Agreement  does  not  limit  Employee’s  right  to  receive  an  award  for
information provided to any Government Agencies.

26.2       Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Employer hereby advises Employee as follows:

(a)

(b)

An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law
for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  (i)  is  made  (a)  in  confidence  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (b) solely for the purpose of
reporting  or  investigating  a  suspected  violation  of  law;  or  (ii)  is  made  in  a  complaint  or  other
document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and

An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation
of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret

19

information  in  the  court  proceeding,  if  the  individual  (i)  files  any  document  containing  the  trade
secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

EXHIBIT B - AR B I TRATION

This
Exhibit
B
sets
forth
the
methods
for
resolving
any
controversy,
dispute
or
claim
directly
or
indirectly
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
the
Employment
Agreement
(“Agreement”),
or
the
breach
thereof,
or
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
the
employment
of
Employee,
or
the
termination
thereof,
and
accordingly,
this
Exhibit
B
shall
be
considered
to
be
a
part
of
the
Agreement.

1.

2.

Except for a claim by either Employee or Employer for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise authorized by law,
any controversy, dispute or claim directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach hereof, or
arising  out  of  or  relating  to  the  employment  of  Employee,  or  the  termination  thereof,  including  without  limitation  any
claim involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement or wrongful termination or discrimination claims, shall
be  submitted  to  binding  arbitration  in  accordance  with  the  employment  arbitration  rules  then  in  effect  of  the  Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”), to the extent not inconsistent with this paragraph.  This Exhibit B covers any
claim  Employee  might  have  against  any  officer,  director,  employee,  or  agent  of  Employer,  or  any  of  Employer’s
subsidiaries,  divisions,  and  affiliates,  and  all  successors  and  assigns  of  any  of  them.    The  promises  by  Employer  and
Employee  to arbitrate  differences,  rather  than  litigate  them  before  courts  or other  bodies,  provide  consideration  for  each
other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement.

Claims  Subject  to  Arbitration  .    This  Exhibit  B  covers  all  claims  arising  in  the  course  of  Employee's  employment  by
Employer  except  for  those  claims  specifically  excluded  from  coverage  as  set  forth  in  paragraph  3  of  this  Exhibit  B.    It
contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Only claims that are justifiable under applicable
state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit B.  Such claims covered by this arbitration provision include, but are not
limited  to,  any  dispute  or  controversy  arising  out  of  Employee’s  employment,  the  events  leading  up  to  Employee  being
offered  employment,  the  cessation  of  Employee’s  employment,  the  compensation,  terms,  and  other  conditions  of
Employee’s  employment,  or  statements  made  or  actions  taken  at  any  time  regarding  Employee’s  employment  at  the
Company which could have been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, claims under
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990; Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code; the Fair Labor Standards Act,
as amended; the federal Family and Medical Leave Act; the Lilly Ledbetter Act; GINA; all laws arising under the State of
Nevada pertaining to civil rights, employment, whistleblower, or common law, and any other federal, state, or local civil or
human  rights  law,  or  any  other  local,  state  or  federal  law,  regulation,  or  ordinance,  as  well  as  any  claim  based  on  any
public policy, contract, tort, or common law or any claim for costs, attorney's or other fees, or

22

other expenses, wages or other compensation; work related injury claims not covered under workers’ compensation laws;
wrongful  discharge;  and  any  and  all  unlawful  employment  discrimination  and/or  harassment  claims  (collectively,
“Claims”).   Employee
expressly
understands
and
agrees
that
Employee
shall
have
no
right
or
authority
to
raise
any
dispute
or
to
have
any
dispute
heard
or
arbitrated
as
a
class
or
collective
action
or
in
a
representative
or
private
attorney
general
capacity
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
persons
or
the
general
public.
   This arbitration provision does not
require  arbitration  of  claims  for  workers’  compensation  or  unemployment  insurance.    This  Arbitration  Agreement  is
intended to be construed as broadly as possible under applicable law so that all claims and defenses that could be raised
before a court must instead be raised in arbitration.  However, nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed as
precluding  Employee  from  filing  a  charge  or  complaint  with  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  or
equivalent  state  agency  ,  the  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  or  any  other  similar  state  or  federal  agency  seeking
administrative resolution of a dispute or claim.

Claims Not Subject to Arbitration .  Claims under state workers’  compensation  statutes or unemployment  compensation
statutes are specifically excluded from this Exhibit B.  Claims pertaining to any of Employer’s employee welfare benefit
and pension plans are excluded from this Exhibit B.  In the case of a denial of benefits under any of Employer’s employee
welfare benefit or pension plans, the filing and appeal procedures in those plans must be utilized.  Claims by Employer or
Employee  for  injunctive  or  other  relief  for  violations  of  non-competition  and/or  confidentiality  agreements  are  also
specifically excluded from this Exhibit B.

Non-Waiver  of  Substantive  Rights  .    This  Exhibit  B  does  not  waive  any  rights  or  remedies  available  under  applicable
statutes  or  common  law.    However,  it  does  waive  Employee's  right  to  pursue  those  rights  and  remedies  in  a  judicial
forum.    By  signing  the  Agreement  and  the  acknowledgment  at  the  end  of  this  Exhibit  B,  the  undersigned  Employee
voluntarily  agrees  to  arbitrate  his  or  her  claims  covered  by  this  Exhibit  B.  This  Exhibit  B  also  does  not  waive  the
Employee’s  right  to  file  a  charge  or  complaint  with  any  federal  or  state  agency,  including  with  the  Equal  Employment
Opportunity Commission.

Time  Limit  to  Pursue  Arbitration;  Initiation  :  To  ensure  timely  resolution  of  disputes,  Employee  and  Employer  must
initiate  arbitration  within  the  statute  of  limitations  (deadline  for  filing)  provided  for  by  applicable  law  pertaining  to  the
claim.  The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim.  Any aggrieved party is encouraged
to give written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences
may take place promptly.  The parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit
B, give written notice of a claim to the other party.  If the Employee is the aggrieved party, notice must be given to the
President of Employer with a copy to MGM Resorts International’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel.  If the
Employer is the aggrieved party,

23

3.

4.

5.

notice must be given to the Employee at the last known address provided by Employee.    The w ritten notice shall identify
and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.

6.

Selecting an Arbitrator : This Exhibit B mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation  Service  (JAMS)  regarding  employment  disputes.    The  arbitrator  shall  be  either  a  retired  judge  or  an  attorney
experienced  in employment  law  and  licensed  to  practice  in  the state  in which  arbitration  is convened.   The  parties  shall
select one arbitrator from among a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS.  If the parties are unable to

Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures :

a.

b.

c.

d.

e.

Employee may be represented by an attorney of Employee’s choice at Employee’s own expense.

The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard
to its choice of law provisions) and/or federal law when applicable.  In all cases, this Exhibit B shall provide for
the broadest level of arbitration of claims between an employer and employee under Nevada law.  The arbitrator
is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.

The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such
relief is specifically authorized by an applicable state or federal statute or common law.  In such a situation, the
arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted.

The  applicable  law  with  respect  to  privilege,  including  attorney-client  privilege,  work  product,  and  offers  to
compromise must be followed.

The  parties  shall  have  the  right  to  conduct  reasonable  discovery,  including  written  and  oral  (deposition)
discovery  and  to  subpoena  and/or  request  copies  of  records,  documents  and  other  relevant  discoverable
information  consistent  with  the  procedural  rules  of  JAMS.    The  arbitrator  shall  decide  disputes  regarding  the
scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing and/or trial proceeding.  The
parties shall have the right to file a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment, and the arbitrator
shall entertain such motions.

f.

The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure.  The arbitrator shall
have subpoena power so that either Employee or Employer may summon witnesses.  The arbitrator

24

shall use the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief.  Any party, at its
own  expense,  may  arrange  for  and  pay  the  cost  of  a  court  reporter  to  provide  a  stenographic  record  of  the
proceedings.

g. Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada,
except  that  if  the  Employee  is  employed  by  the  Employer  in  the  United  States  but  outside  Clark  County,
Nevada,  the  arbitration  hearing  or  proceeding  shall  take  place  in  the  county  and  State  in  which  Employee  is
employed or was last employed.

Arbitrator’s  Award  : The  arbitrator  shall  issue  a written  decision  containing  the specific  issues raised  by the parties,  the
specific findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law.  The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30
days after conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested.  The arbitrator may
not  award  any relief  or remedy  in excess  of  what  a court  could  grant  under  applicable  law.   The  arbitrator’s  decision  is
final and binding on both parties.  Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
competent jurisdiction.

a.

b.

Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit
B and to confirm, enforce, vacate or modify an arbitration award.

In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf
of  Employee  which  is  subject  to  arbitration  under  this  Exhibit  B,  Employee  hereby  waives  the  right  to
participate  in  any  monetary  or  other  recovery  obtained  by  such  agency  or  third  party  in  any  such  action,  and
Employee's sole remedy with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to
the provisions of this Exhibit B.

Fees  and  Expenses  :  Employer  shall  be  responsible  for  paying  any  filing  fee  and  the  fees  and  costs  of  the
arbitrator.    Employee  and  Employer  shall  each  pay  for  their  own  expenses,  attorney’s  fees  (a  party’s  responsibility  for
his/her/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be
awarded as a remedy), and costs and fees regarding witness, photocopying and other preparation expenses.  If any party
prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney’s fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement
providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing
party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim(s).

8.

9.

10.

The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit B shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment with Employer and
the expiration of the Agreement.  These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed

25

11.

12.

13.

by both parties and which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the provisions of this Exhibit B.

The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit B do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit B shall have the same definition as in the Employment Agreement to which
this is Exhibit B.

If any provision of this Exhibit B is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication
shall not affect the validity of the remainder of Exhibit B.  All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

BOTH PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:  THEY HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS EXHIBIT B IN ITS ENTIRETY, THEY
UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, EXHIBIT B CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL TERM AND CONDITION OF THE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO WHICH IT IS EXHIBIT B, AND THEY AGREE TO ABIDE BY ITS TERMS.

The parties also specifically acknowledge that by agreeing to the terms of this Exhibit B, they are waiving the right to pursue claims
covered  by  this  Exhibit  B  in  a  judicial  forum  and  instead  agree  to  arbitrate  all  such  claims  before  an  arbitrator  without  a  court  or
jury.  It is specifically understood that this Exhibit B does not waive any rights or remedies which are available under applicable state
and  federal  statutes  or  common  law.  Both  parties  enter  into  this  Exhibit  B  voluntarily  and  not  in  reliance  on  any  promises  or
representation by the other party other than those contained in the Agreement or in this Exhibit B.

counsel and that Employee has availed himself/herself of that opportunity to the extent Employee wishes to do so.

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULATION
AND
LICENSING

Exhibit
99.2

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject
to  extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  where  it  is  located.  These  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  generally  concern  the
responsibility,  financial  stability,  and  character  of  the  owners,  managers,  and  persons  with  financial  interest  in  the  gaming  operations.  Violations  of  laws  in  one
jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

In addition to gaming regulations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which we
operate.  These  laws  and  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  smoking,  environmental  matters,
employment  and  immigration,  currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  land  use,  marketing  and  advertising,  timeshare,  lending,  privacy,
telemarketing,  regulations  applicable  under  the  Office  of  Foreign  Asset  Control,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  the  various  reporting  and  anti-money
laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any
material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and
operating results.

Nevada
Government
Regulation

The  ownership  and  operation  of  our  casino  gaming  facilities  in  Nevada  are  subject  to  the  Nevada  Gaming  Control  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the “Nevada Act”), and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada
Gaming Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”), and various county and city licensing agencies (the
“local authorities”). The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

The laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with,

among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices;

the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal
affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;

providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and

providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

Any change in the laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations.

Each  of  our  subsidiaries  that  currently  operate  casinos  in  Nevada  (collectively,  the  “Nevada  casino  licensees”)  is  required  to  be  licensed  by  the  Nevada
Gaming Authorities. Each gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New York
Hotel & Casino, LLC, Bellagio, LLC, MGM Resorts Manufacturing Corp., and Aria Resort & Casino, LLC are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors of
gaming  devices  (collectively,  the  “Nevada  manufacturer  and  distributor  licensees”).  Certain  of  our  subsidiaries  have  also  been  licensed  or  found  suitable  as
shareholders, members, or general partners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees. The Nevada casino
licensees, Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.”

We, along with Mandalay Resort Group, are required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as publicly traded corporations (collectively, the “Nevada
registered corporations”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodically
to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require. No person
may become a stockholder or

member  of,  or  receive  any  percentage  of  profits  from,  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  without  first  registering  with  (for  equity  ownership  of  5%  or  less),  or
obtaining  licenses  and  approvals  from  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities.  Additionally,  the  local  authorities  have  taken  the  position  that  they  have  the  authority  to
approve  all  persons  owning  or  controlling  the  stock  of  any  corporation  controlling  a  gaming  licensee.  The  Nevada  registered  corporations,  Mirage  Resorts,
Incorporated  and  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  have  obtained  from  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  the  various  registrations,  approvals,  permits,  and  licenses
required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.

The  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  may  investigate  any  individual  who  has  a  material  relationship  to,  or  material  involvement  with,  the  Nevada  registered
corporations or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming
licensee. Officers, directors, and certain key employees of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be
required  to  be  licensed  by  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities.  Officers,  directors,  and  key  employees  of  the  Nevada  registered  corporations  who  are  actively  and
directly involved in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.
The Nevada Gaming  Authorities  may deny an application  for licensing  or a finding of suitability  for any cause  they deem  reasonable.  A finding  of suitability  is
comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant for licensing
or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation.
Changes  in  licensed  positions  must  be  reported  to  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities,  and,  in  addition  to  their  authority  to  deny  an  application  for  a  finding  of
suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the
Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would have
to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries
to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not
subject to judicial review in Nevada.

The  Nevada  registered  corporations  and  the  Nevada  casino  licensees  are  required  to  submit  detailed  financial  and  operating  reports  to  the  Nevada
Commission. Substantially  all of the Nevada registered  corporations’  and the Nevada licensed  subsidiaries’  material  loans, leases, sales of securities,  and similar
financing transactions must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission.

If the Nevada Commission determined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subject
to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures, our gaming licenses and those of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries. In addition, the Nevada registered
corporations and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the
discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments and, under certain
circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to the
State  of  Nevada.  Limitation,  conditioning,  or  suspension  of  any  gaming  license  or  the  appointment  of  a  supervisor  could  (and  revocation  of  any  gaming  license
would) materially adversely affect our gaming operations.

Any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his
or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be
inconsistent  with  the  declared  policies  of  the  State  of  Nevada.  The  applicant  must  pay  all  costs  of  investigation  incurred  by  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  in
conducting any such investigation.

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.
The Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability
within 30 days after the Chair of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as defined
in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of
such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver
may, in certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.

An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course
of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors,
any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies, or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission
finds to be inconsistent with holding our

2

voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

•

•

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders;

making  financial  and  other  inquiries  of  management  of  the  type  normally  made  by securities  analysts  for  informational  purposes  and  not  to  cause  a
change in its management, policies, or operations; and

such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial

information including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the
Chair of the Nevada Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation of its
application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any
stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed
by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a
stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries:

•

•

•

•

pays that person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;

allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;

pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

fails  to  pursue  all  lawful  efforts  to  require  such  unsuitable  person  to  relinquish  his  or  her  voting  securities  including  if  necessary,  the  immediate
purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

The  Nevada  Commission  may,  in  its  discretion,  require  the  holder  of  any  debt  security  of  the  Nevada  registered  corporations  to  file  an  application,  be
investigated, and be found suitable to hold the debt security. If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to
the Nevada Act, the registered corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it:

•

•

•

•

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever;

recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction.

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held
in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure
to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of
the beneficial owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that such
securities are subject to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations.

The Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities
or the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those
purposes or for similar purposes. An approval, if given, does not

3

constitute  a  finding,  recommendation,  or  approval  by  the  Nevada  Commission  or  the  Nevada  Board  as  to  the  accuracy  or  adequacy  of  the  prospectus  or  the
investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

On July 27, 2017, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years,

subject to certain conditions.

Changes in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements,
or any act or conduct by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquire
control of a registered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control
of the registered corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material relationship
or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The  Nevada  legislature  has  declared  that  some  corporate  acquisitions  opposed  by  management,  repurchases  of  voting  securities,  and  corporate  defensive
tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate
gaming.  The  Nevada  Commission  has  established  a  regulatory  scheme  to  ameliorate  the  potentially  adverse  effects  of  these  business  practices  upon  Nevada’s
gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to:

•

•

•

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the
current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of
recapitalization proposed by a registered corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders for
the purpose of acquiring control of that corporation.

License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the local

authorities. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either:

•

•

•

a percentage of the gross revenues received;

the number of gaming devices operated; or

the number of table games operated.

The tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%. A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of

live entertainment are provided. The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.

Because we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund
in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to
increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the
Nevada Act. We would be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we:

•

•

knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

4

•

•

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects
or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

employ, contract with, or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada
on the ground of personal unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

The sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries  is subject to licensing, control, and regulation  by the applicable local authorities. All
licenses  are  revocable  and  are  not  transferable.  The  agencies  involved  have  full  power  to  limit,  condition,  suspend,  or  revoke  any  such  license,  and  any  such
disciplinary action could (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.

Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation

The  Michigan  Gaming  Control  and  Revenue  Act  (the  “Michigan  Act”)  subjects  the  owners  and  operators  of  casino  gaming  facilities  to  extensive  state
licensing and regulatory requirements. The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such
local ordinances regulating casino gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it. We are subject to the Michigan Act through
our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (the “licensed subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit. Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit,
LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.

The  Michigan  Act  creates  the  Michigan  Gaming  Control  Board  (the  “Michigan  Board”)  and  authorizes  it  to  grant  casino  licenses  to  not  more  than  three
applicants  who  have  entered  into  development  agreements  with  the  City  of  Detroit.  The  Michigan  Board  is  granted  extensive  authority  to  conduct  background
investigations and determine the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated
companies and persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company. Institutional investors holding less
than certain specified amounts of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act since we are a publicly
traded corporation, and provided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs. Any
person who supplies goods or services to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person who
supplies other goods or services to the licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board. In addition,
any individual employed by the licensed subsidiary or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performed
in a restricted area or a gaming area of the licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license. The applicant
must  establish  its  suitability  as  to  integrity,  moral  character  and  reputation,  business  probity,  financial  ability  and  experience,  responsibility,  and  other  criteria
deemed appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determination
that the licensee no longer meets the requirements for licensure.

The Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license. The licensed subsidiary is also subject to
fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules. In the event that the licensed subsidiary’s license is revoked or suspended for
more than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is required to preserve the assets to ensure that they
shall continue to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person or
entity who meets the requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations.

The  Michigan  Board  has  adopted  administrative  rules  to  implement  the  terms  of  the  Michigan  Act.  Among  other  things,  the  rules  impose  more  detailed

substantive and procedural requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations.

Included are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the Michigan
Board, internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership
interests in licensed casinos. The rules also establish numerous

5

Michigan  Board  procedures  regarding  licensing,  disciplinary  and  other  hearings,  and  similar  matters.  The  rules  have  the  force  of  law  and  are  binding  on  the
Michigan Board as well as on applicants for or holders of casino licenses.

Under rules of the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly traded
company  which  is  the  holding  company  of  a  Michigan  casino  licensee  must  obtain  approval  of  the  acquisition  from  the  Michigan  Board.  Subsequent  to  the
acquisition, the person or company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares. In addition, if
the  acquisition  is  by  a  company,  “key  persons”  in  the  company  (generally  the  officers,  directors,  managerial  employees,  and  significant  owners)  must  also  be
determined  to  be  “suitable”  and  “qualified.”  “Institutional  investors”  (as  that  term  is  defined  in  the  Michigan  Act)  may  generally  obtain  a  waiver  from  these
requirements if the institutional investor has less than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company. Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, or
filing  Schedule  13D  or  13G  with  the  SEC,  the  Michigan  Board  must  be  notified  by  the  investor.  Unless  otherwise  ordered  by  the  Michigan  Board,  institutional
investors acquiring less than 10% equity ownership in the publicly traded company are entitled to an exemption from the approval requirements, but are required to
file  an  institutional  waiver  application  with  the  Michigan  Board.  Institutional  investors  acquiring  10%  or  more  equity  ownership  must  apply  for  an  institutional
waiver, supplying certain information delineated in Rule 504(3). Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership must
apply to the Michigan Board for approval of the acquisition within 45 days after it occurs. The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitability
and qualification determinations.

The term “institutional investor” includes financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, etc. The shares held by the institutional
investor must be held for investment purposes only. The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes: voting by proxy
furnished  by  the  board  of  directors,  on  all  matters  voted  on  by  the  holders  of  the  voting  securities;  serving  as  a  member  of  a  committee  of  creditors  or  security
holders  formed  in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;  nominating  a  candidate  for  election  or  appointment  to  the  board  of  directors  in  connection  with  a  debt
restructuring; accepting appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the
conclusion of the member’s term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purposes and
not to cause a change in its management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent.

The  Michigan  Liquor  Control  Commission  licenses,  controls  and  regulates  the  sale  of  alcoholic  beverages  by  the  licensed  subsidiary  pursuant  to  the
Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998. The Michigan Act also requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control
Code.

The Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.”
The ordinance  authorizes  casino gaming only by operators  who are licensed  by the Michigan  Board and are parties  to a development  agreement  which has been
approved and certified by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties. The development agreement among the City of Detroit,
MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect. Under the
ordinance,  the  licensed  subsidiary  is  required  to  submit  to  the  Mayor  of  Detroit  and  to  the  City  Council  periodic  reports  regarding  its  compliance  with  the
development agreement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the Mayor
of Detroit to monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and to notify
the City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of such
action  to  the  Michigan  Board  within  five  business  days  along  with  Detroit’s  request  that  the  Michigan  Board  revoke  the  relevant  operator’s  casino  license.  If  a
development agreement is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit.

The  administrative  rules  of  the  Michigan  Board  prohibit  the  licensed  subsidiary  or  us  from  entering  into  a  debt  transaction  affecting  the  capitalization  or

financial viability of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino. Proceeds of
the wagering tax are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit. In addition to the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annual municipal
service fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment,
as  adjusted  annually  based  upon  a  consumer  price  index,  in  the  initial  amount  of  approximately  $8.3  million  to  be  paid  to  Michigan  to  defray  its  regulatory
enforcement  and  other  casino-related  costs.  These  payments  are  in  addition  to  the  taxes,  fees  and  assessments  customarily  paid  by  business  entities  situated  in
Detroit.  The  licensed  subsidiary  is  also  obligated  to  pay  1%  of  its  adjusted  gross  receipts  to  Detroit,  to  be  increased  to  2%  of  its  adjusted  gross  receipts  in  any
calendar year in which adjusted gross receipts exceed $400 million.

Mississippi
Government
Regulation

We  conduct  our  Mississippi  gaming  operations  through  two  indirect  subsidiaries,  Beau  Rivage  Resorts,  LLC  which  operates  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,
Mississippi, and MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC, which operates the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi (collectively, the “casino licensees”). The
operation of casino facilities in Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue.

The  Mississippi  Gaming  Control  Act  (the  “Mississippi  Act”)  legalized  casino  gaming  in  Mississippi.  The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  adopted

regulations in furtherance of the Mississippi Act. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;

maintain  effective  control  over  the  financial  practices  of  licensees,  including  establishing  minimum  procedures  for  internal  fiscal  affairs  and
safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission;

prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;

provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and

ensure that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents.

The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or the
Mississippi  Gaming Commission’s  interpretations  thereof  may limit  or otherwise  materially  affect  the types of gaming  that  may be conducted,  and could have a
material adverse effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if
the voters in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of December 31, 2017, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in
the state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties. Prior to Hurricane Katrina,
Mississippi law required that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the
waters of the State of Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the law
became  effective  which allowed  gaming  facilities  to be constructed  on land in the three  Gulf Coast counties,  provided  that  no portion  of the gaming  facilities  is
located  more  than 800 feet  from  the mean  high water  line  of the Mississippi  Sound or designated  bays  on the Sound. The 800-foot  limit  does  not apply to non-
gaming  facilities.  The  law  permits  unlimited  stakes  gaming  on  permanently  moored  dockside  vessels  or  in  land-based  facilities  on  a  24-hour  basis  and  does  not
restrict the percentage of space which may be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi.

The  casino  licensees  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  Gaming  licenses  require  the  periodic
payment of fees and taxes and are not transferable. Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. The
current license of Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC is effective through April 20, 2019 and the current license of MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC. is effective through June
22, 2021.

We  are  registered  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  under  the  Mississippi  Act  as  a  publicly  traded  holding  company  of  the  casino  licensees.  As  a
registered publicly traded corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodically
submit  detailed  financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  and  furnish  any  other  information  which  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission may require. If we are unable to satisfy the registration requirements of the Mississippi Act, we and our casino licensees cannot own or operate gaming
facilities  in  Mississippi.  The  casino  licensees  are  also  required  to  periodically  submit  detailed  financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby. With certain exceptions, no person may become a
stockholder  of  or  receive  any  percentage  of  profits  from  the  casino  licensees  without  first  obtaining  licenses  and  approvals  from  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission.

7

Certain  of our  officers,  directors  and employees  must  be  found suitable  or  be  licensed  by the  Mississippi  Gaming Commission.  We  believe  that  we have
applied for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional
persons to file applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found
suitable, in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation. A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personal
and  financial  information  followed  by  a  thorough  investigation.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  a  person  who  is  subject  to  a  finding  of  suitability  will  be  found
suitable  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  may  deny  an  application  for  a  finding  of  suitability  for  any  cause  that  it
deems reasonable. Findings of suitability must be periodically renewed.

Changes in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding
of  suitability,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  jurisdiction  to  disapprove  a  change  in  a  licensed  position.  The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  the
power  to  require  us  to  suspend  or  dismiss  officers,  directors  and  other  key  employees  or  sever  relationships  with  other  persons  who  refuse  to  file  appropriate
applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities.

Employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to
issue  a  work  permit  to  a  person  convicted  of  a  felony  and  it  may  refuse  to  issue  a  work  permit  to  a  gaming  employee  if  the  employee  has  committed  various
misdemeanors or knowingly violated the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause.

At  any  time,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  the  power  to  investigate  and  require  a  finding  of  suitability  of  any  of  our  record  or  beneficial
stockholders,  regardless  of  the  percentage  of  ownership.  Mississippi  law  requires  any  person  who  acquires  more  than  5%  of  our  voting  securities  to  report  the
acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more
than  10%  of  our  voting  securities,  as  reported  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission,  must  apply  for  a  finding  of  suitability  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission. An applicant for finding of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of a
registered public or private company’s voting securities. However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutional
investors to own beneficially up to 25% and, under certain circumstances, up to 29%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding of
suitability. Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a
waiver of a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 25% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 29%) of the voting securities of a
registered  or  licensed  company,  and  (ii)  holds  the  voting  securities  for  investment  purposes  only.  An  institutional  investor  shall  not  be  deemed  to  hold  voting
securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for
the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change in
the registered or licensed company’s corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gaming
affiliates, or any other action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securities
for investment purposes only.

Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

voting, directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such voting
securities;

serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring;

nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring;

accepting appointment or election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a
debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term;

making  financial  and  other  inquiries  of  management  of  the  type  normally  made  by  securities  analysts  for  informational  purposes  and  not  to  cause  a
change in management, policies or operations; and

such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

8

If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of
beneficial owners. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered
public company’s equity interests for any cause it deems reasonable.

We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities. In
addition, under the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigate
the holders, and require the holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities.

Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found
suitable, the Mississippi Gaming Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt
instrument  exercises  a  material  influence  over  the  gaming  operations  of  the  entity  in  question.  Any  holder  of  debt  securities  required  to  apply  for  a  finding  of
suitability must pay all investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation.

Any  person  who  fails  or  refuses  to  apply  for  a  finding  of  suitability  or  a  license  within  30  days  after  being  ordered  to  do  so  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission may be found unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the time
that the Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor. After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holder
of our debt securities or to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we:

•

•

•

•

•

pay the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or other distribution whatsoever;

recognize the exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person;

pay the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances;

make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or

fail  to  pursue  all  lawful  efforts  to  require  the  unsuitable  person  to  divest  himself  or  herself  of  the  securities,  including,  if  necessary,  the  immediate
purchase of the securities for cash at a fair market value.

The  casino  licensees  must  maintain  in  Mississippi  a  current  ledger  with  respect  to  the  ownership  of  their  equity  securities  and  we  must  maintain  in
Mississippi a current list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us. The ledger and
stockholder lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time. If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a
nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A failure to make that disclosure
may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

The Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that the
securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
granted us a waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our
securities at any time.

Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by the casino licensees must be reported to or approved by the Mississippi
Gaming  Commission.  The  licensed  subsidiaries  may  not  make  a  public  offering  of  their  securities,  but  may  pledge  or  mortgage  casino  facilities  with  the  prior
approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.  We  may  not  make  a  public  offering  of  our  securities  without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to
retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of the
prospectus or the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. Effective June 23, 2015, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of the
prior approval requirement for our securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions. The waiver may be rescinded for good cause without
prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

9

Under the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering, or
pledge  their  assets  to secure  payment  or performance  of the obligations  evidenced  by such a security  issued by us, without the prior  approval  of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interests
foreclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by
us and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by us are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The waiver of
the prior approval requirement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the prior
approval requirement for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions.

We cannot change our control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without
the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and
other  persons  having  a  material  relationship  or  involvement  with  the  entity  proposing  to  acquire  control,  to  be  investigated  and  licensed  as  part  of  the  approval
process relating to the transaction.

The  Mississippi  Legislature  has  declared  that  some  corporate  acquisitions  opposed  by  management,  repurchases  of  voting  securities  and  other  corporate
defensive tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be
injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse
effects  of  these  business  practices  upon  Mississippi’s  gaming  industry  and  to  further  Mississippi’s  policy  to  assure  the  financial  stability  of  corporate  gaming
operators  and  their  affiliates,  preserve  the  beneficial  aspects  of  conducting  business  in  the  corporate  form,  and  promote  a  neutral  environment  for  the  orderly
governance of corporate affairs.

We may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess
of the current market price of its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before we may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The
regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board of Directors opposing a
tender offer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us.

Prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission must be obtained before we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associated with
the gaming license of the casino licensees conduct gaming operations outside of the United States. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it have
access to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, foreign gaming operations. We believe that we have applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gaming
approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gaming operations outside of the United States.

If  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  decides  that  the  casino  licensees  violated  a  gaming  law  or  regulation,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  could
limit, condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines
for each separate violation. A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaming
license.

Because of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning or
suspension  of  the  casino  licensees’  gaming  license  or  our  registration  as  a  publicly  traded  holding  company,  or  the  appointment  of  a  supervisor  could,  and  the
revocation of any gaming license or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations.

The casino licensees must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to
the county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable
either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the number
of table games operated by the casino.

The  license  fee  payable  to  the  State  of  Mississippi  is  based  upon  “gross  revenues,”  generally  defined  as  cash  receipts  less  cash  payouts  to  customers  as
winnings, and generally equals 8% of gross revenue. These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. The
gross revenue fee imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi
and equals approximately 4% of gross revenue.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s plan
include  a  500-car  parking  facility  in  close  proximity  to  the  casino  complex  and  infrastructure  facilities  which  will  amount  to  at  least  25%  of  the  casino  cost.
Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at

10

least 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in compliance with this requirement. On January 21,
1999, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%;
however,  the  regulation  grandfathers  existing  licensees  and  applies  only  to  new  casino  projects  and  casinos  that  are  not  operating  at  the  time  of  acquisition  or
purchase,  and  would  therefore  not  apply  to  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica.  In  any  event,  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  would  comply  with  such
requirement. On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted further amendments to this regulation to impose additional requirements on new
casino projects. However, the amended regulation grandfathers any licensee who has been licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December 31,
2013; therefore, the amendments do not apply to Beau Rivage or Gold Strike Tunica.

Both the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue license, control and regulate the sale of
alcoholic beverages by the casino licensees. Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located therein
to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ key
officers and managers and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial information to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed. All such licenses are non-transferable. The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the full
power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions. Any
disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.

Macau
S.A.R.
Laws
and
Regulations

MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  regulated  as  a  gaming  operator  under  applicable  Macau  law  and  our  ownership  interest  in  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to
continuing regulatory scrutiny. We are required to be approved by the Macau government (gaming authorities) to own an interest in a gaming operator. Authorized
gaming operators must pay periodic fees and taxes, and gaming rights are not transferable, unless approved by the Macau government. MGM Grand Paradise must
periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authorities
may  require.  No  person  may  acquire  any  rights  over  the  shares  or  assets  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  without  first  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  Macau  gaming
authorities. The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating to such
shares,  and  any  act  involving  the  granting  of  voting  rights  or  other  stockholders’  rights  to  persons  or  entities  other  than  the  original  owners,  would  require  the
approval of the Macau government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macau gaming authorities. The stock of MGM Grand Paradise and
its casinos, assets and equipment shall not be subject to any liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any
of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that
is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise. Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply to securities
that are listed and tradable on a stock market. Since MGM Grand Paradise’s securities are not listed and tradable on a stock market this approval requirement applies
to transfers of MGM Grand Paradise’s shares. In addition, this contract requires that the Macau government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or
the grant of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand
Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM
Grand Paradise. This notice requirement will not apply, however, to securities listed and tradable on a stock exchange.

MGM Grand Paradise is in no case allowed to delegate the management of gaming operations to a management company, and is in no case allowed to enter
into a management contract by which its managing powers are or might be assumed by a third party. Any act or contract by which MGM Grand Paradise assigns,
transfers,  alienates or creates  liens or encumbrances  on gaming operations  to or in favor of a third party is prohibited,  unless previously approved by the Macau
government.

The Macau  gaming  authorities  may  investigate  any individual  who has a  material  relationship  to, or material  involvement  with,  MGM Grand Paradise  to
determine whether MGM Grand Paradise’s suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by that individual. MGM Grand Paradise shareholders with 5% or more of
the share capital and directors must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, and accept
the  persistent  and long-term  inspection  and supervision  exercised  by the  Macau  government.  MGM Grand Paradise  is required  to  immediately  notify  the Macau
government should MGM Grand Paradise become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% or more
of the share capital, or any director or key employee. Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities. The Macau gaming
authorities have jurisdiction to deny an application for a finding of suitability.

11

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macau gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.
Any stockholder subject to a suitability process who is found unsuitable must transfer their shares to a third party within a term set by the Macau government. If such
transfer is not consummated, MGM Grand Paradise must acquire those shares. If any officer, director or key employee is found unsuitable, MGM Grand Paradise
must sever all relationships with that person. In case of failure to act in accordance thereof, MGM Grand Paradise would become subject to administrative sanctions
and penalties.

The  Macau  government  must  give  their  prior  approval  to  changes  in  control  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  through  a  merger,  consolidation,  stock  or  asset
acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control. Entities seeking to acquire control of a
registered corporation must satisfy the Macau government concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. The Macau gaming authorities may
also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control,
to be considered suitable as part of the approval process of the transaction.

The Macau gaming authorities also have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and

their affiliates.

The subconcession contract requires the Macau gaming authorities’ prior approval of any recapitalization plan, any increase of the capital stock by public
subscription,  any  issue  of  preferential  shares  or  any  creation,  issue  or  transformation  of  types  or  series  of  shares  representative  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  capital
stock, as well as any change in the constituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise. The Chief Executive of Macau could also require
MGM Grand Paradise to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary.

MGM Macau and MGM Cotai were constructed and are operated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract. This subconcession excludes the
following gaming activities: mutual bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling
activities  on  ships  or  planes.  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  is  exclusively  governed  by  Macau  law.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of Macau in case of any potential dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.

MGM Grand Paradise’s  subconcession contract  expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations  and
related equipment in MGM Macau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM Resorts
International  will cease  to generate  any revenues  from  these  operations.  Beginning  on April 20, 2017, the  Macau government  may redeem  the subconcession  by
giving MGM Grand Paradise at least one year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity.

The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption.

The Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon the
occurrence  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  the
subconcession contract. If the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though no
specific cure period for that purpose is provided.

The subconcession contract contains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions, the compliance with which is subjective. MGM Grand

Paradise has the following obligations under the subconcession contract:

•

•

•

•

ensure the proper operation and conduct of casino games;

employ people with appropriate qualifications;

operate and conduct casino games of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and

safeguard and ensure Macau’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas.

The subconcession contract requires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place.

MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also subject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities.

12

Under the  subconcession,  MGM Grand  Paradise  Limited  is  obligated  to pay  to the Macau  S.A.R. an annual  premium  with a  fixed  portion  and  a variable
portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 mil lion patacas
(approximately  $3.83   million,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December    31 ,  201  8 ).  The  variable  portion  is  equal  to  300,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  reserved
exclusively for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine,
including slot machines (approximately $ 38,304 , $ 19,152 and $12 8 , respectively, based on exchange rates at December  31 , 201 8 ), subject to a minimum of
forty five million patacas (approximately $5. 75  million, based on exchange rates at December  31 , 201 8 ). MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special
gaming  tax  of  35%  of  gross  gaming  revenues  and  applicable  withholding  taxes.  It  must  also  contribute  1.6%  and  2.4%  (a  portion  of  which  must  be  used  for
promotion  of  tourism  in  Macau)  of  its  gross  gaming  revenue  to  a  public  foundation  designated  by  the  Macau  S.A.R.  government  and  to  the  Macau  S.A.R,
respectively, as special levy.

Currently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for
credit losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has to
pay taxes on its winnings from these customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables.

MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau Land

Contract”). The land concession will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable.

The MGM Macau Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau. In addition,
MGM Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract. The rent amount may be revised every five years by the
Macau government, according to the provisions of the Macau Land law.

In addition, MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use an approximately 18 acre site in Cotai Macau and develop a

second resort and casino (the “MGM Cotai Land Contract”). The land concession will expire on January 8, 2038 and is renewable.

The MGM Cotai Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium, which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Cotai. In addition,
MGM Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Cotai Land Contract. The rent amount may be revised every five years by the
Macau government, according to the provisions of the Macau Land law.

MGM  Grand  Paradise  received  an  exemption  from  Macau’s  corporate  income  tax  on  profits  generated  by  the  operation  of  casino  games  of  chance  for  a
period of five-years starting at January 1, 2007. In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years. The
exemption was further extended on September 7, 2016 through March 31, 2020.

Maryland
Government
Regulation

The Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensive
state  licensing  and  regulatory  requirements.  We  are  subject  to  the  Maryland  VLT  Law  and  the  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  it  through  our  ownership
interest in MGM National Harbor, LLC, which operates the MGM National Harbor video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

Under the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lottery
and  Gaming  Control  Agency  (“Maryland  Agency”),  maintains  authority  to  regulate  the  operation  of  video  lottery  terminals  and  tables  games  within  the  State  of
Maryland,  and  to  issue  video  lottery  operation  licenses  to  qualified  applicants.  The  Maryland  Video  Lottery  Facility  Location  Commission  (“Maryland  Location
Commission”)  has  the  authority  to  award  up  to  six  video  lottery  operation  licenses  within  the  State  of  Maryland  and  is  responsible  for  evaluating  competing
proposals  and  awarding  the  video  lottery  operation  licenses  to  applicants  based  on  business  and  market,  economic  development  and  location  siting  factors.  The
Maryland  Location  Commission  cannot  award  a  video  lottery  operation  license  to  an  applicant  until  the  Maryland  Commission  determines  that  the  applicant  is
qualified.  On  October  10,  2013,  the  Maryland  Commission  determined  that  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  all  applicable  principals  were  qualified,  and  on
December  23,  2013,  the  Maryland  Location  Commission  awarded  the  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Prince  George’s  County,  Maryland  to  MGM  National
Harbor,  LLC.  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  was  awarded  the  sixth  and  final  video  lottery  operation  license  in  Maryland.  On  December  7,  2016,  the  Maryland
Commission issued a video lottery operation license to MGM National Harbor, LLC, which license has an initial term of 15 years.

13

The initial license fee was based on the number of video lottery terminals initially proposed within the video lottery facility. As 3,600 video lottery terminals
were proposed for MGM National Harbor, our initial license fee was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that MGM National Harbor
may have up to 3,600 terminals. Within 1 year of the end of the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has a
license term of 10 years and a license fee to be established by statute.

At the request of the Company, on August 17, 2016, the Maryland Commission temporarily reduced the number of permitted video lottery terminals to 3,321,
which temporary reduction was to become permanent if there were not 3,600 terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor by December 8, 2017. However, at the
request of the Company, on June 29, 2017, the Maryland Commission approved a further temporary reduction to not less than 2,700 terminals in connection with a
casino expansion project while preserving the Company’s originally authorized allotment of 3,600 terminals until December 8, 2018. Subsequently, at the request of
the Company, on November 15, 2018, the Maryland Commission approved a continued temporary reduction of not less than 3,130 terminals while preserving the
Company’s originally authorized allotment of 3,600 terminals until December 8, 2019.The Maryland Commission further determined that as of December 8, 2019
the  authorized  number  of  terminals  shall  be  not  less  than  3,130  or  more  than  3,600,  with  the  final  authorized  number  of  terminals  being  the  actual  number  of
terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor as of December 8, 2019.

Under the Maryland VLT Law, video lottery terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.Video lottery facilities are permitted to
operate 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. While alcohol may be offered in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free of charge.
The Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within the
video lottery facility.

The Maryland Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operation
license, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding a
five percent or greater interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law.

The  Maryland  VLT  Law  provides  that  institutional  investors  may  be  exempt  from  certain  regulatory  requirements,  and  an  Institutional  Investor  Waiver
Application may be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors. The term “institutional investor”
generally includes insurance companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc. The Maryland Commission’s
decision  concerning  whether  to  grant  a  waiver  is  discretionary,  and  based  on  a  variety  of  factors  that  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  institutional  investor’s
securities,  whether  the  investor  is  substantially  involved  in  the  video  lottery  operations  of  the  licensee,  and  the  investor’s  gaming  licensure  history  in  other
jurisdictions.

After a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of
the licensee and its officers, directors, and other designated persons. The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lottery
operation license, and may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations is expressly
deemed a revocable privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditioned on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meeting reporting
requirements  and  continuing  to  provide  any  assistance  and  information  necessary  to  the  Maryland  regulators.  Each  licensee  has  an  affirmative  responsibility  to
provide an annual update of applicable licensing information to the Maryland Commission. Among other things, the Maryland Commission is also responsible for
the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, and reviewing and ruling
on complaints, and may conduct unannounced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.

The regulations promulgated to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to video lottery licensing
and  ongoing  operations.  The  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  provisions  concerning:  licensing  investigations  and  hearings;  marketing  controls  and
standards; internal control standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries, surveillance, security, cage and customer
transactions, promotions, and other gaming related controls; facility design standards; table games surveillance; gaming floor plans; the transportation and testing of
video  lottery  terminals  and  table  games  equipment;  the  registration  of  video  lottery  terminals  and  table  games;  voluntary  and  mandatory  patron  exclusion;
responsible gaming; and junket enterprises and representatives. Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation,
provide health insurance and retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility.

Generally,  a  video  lottery  operation  license  may  not  be  transferred,  assigned  or  pledged  as  collateral  without  approval  from  the  Maryland  Commission.
Specifically,  a  licensee  cannot  sell  or  transfer  more  than  5%  of  the  legal  or  beneficial  interests  in  the  licensee  unless  the  Maryland  Commission  is  notified  and
determines that the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and

14

regulatory requirements. If the licensee fails to meet these requirements, the applicable license will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.
Entities  and  individuals  are  also  prohibited  from  owning  an  interest  in  more  than  one  video  lottery  facility,  and  any  application  to  the  Maryland  Location
Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting the applicable interest in the initial license. Applicants seeking investors in an entity
applying  for  a  video  lottery  operation  license  must  make  serious,  good-faith  efforts  to  solicit  and  interview  a  reasonable  number  of  minority  investors  before  a
license will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, and following the award, must again make serious, good-faith efforts to interview minority investors
in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity awarded the license.

The  Maryland  Commission  retains  the  authority  to  recommend  or  propose  changes  to  the  Maryland  VLT  Law,  and  may  amend  or  change  regulations

concerning the Maryland VLT Law, which, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.

New
Jersey
Government
Regulation

Our ownership of Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey subjects us to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJ Commission”) and
the  New  Jersey  Division  of  Gaming  Enforcement  (“NJ  Division”  and,  together  with  the  NJ  Commission,  the  “NJ  Gaming  Authorities”)  are,  to  varying  degrees,
empowered to regulate  a wide spectrum  of gaming and non-gaming related activities  and to approve the form of ownership and financial structure  of not only a
casino licensee, but also its holding and intermediary companies and entity qualifiers.

The  NJ  Commission  issues  casino  licenses  and  casino  key  employee  licenses  and  the  NJ  Division  issues  all  other  types  of  licenses,  including  permits  to
conduct intrastate Internet gaming, approvals to conduct sports wagering pools, and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.
The NJ Division also is responsible for investigating all license applications and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act.

On  June  24,  2010,  the  NJ  Commission  renewed  Borgata’s  casino  license  effective  July  1,  2010  for  a  term  which  became  indefinite  by  operation  of  law.
However, no later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying entities
and individuals must submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification. In addition, the NJ Commission may reopen the
license hearing at any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division. In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries were found
qualified as holding companies of Borgata.

Pursuant to the NJ Act and applicable precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holds any
beneficial interest or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect a
majority of the board of directors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) and each of its
holding, intermediary or subsidiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities.

Persons holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or elect
one or more of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required to
individually qualify. Equity securities are defined in the NJ Act as any voting stock or any other security having a direct or indirect participation in the profits of the
issuer. Notwithstanding either  the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities  of a holding company or the requirement  that a casino
licensee  establish  and  maintain  the  qualification  of  certain  holders  of  debt  securities,  the  NJ  Act  provides  for  a  waiver  of  qualification  for  passive  “institutional
investors,” as defined by the NJ Act under certain circumstances.

Casino  licensees  are  also  required  to  establish  and  maintain  the  qualifications  of  any  financial  backer,  investor,  mortgagee,  bondholder,  or  holder  of
indentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds
25%  or  more  of  such  financial  instruments  or  other  evidences  of  indebtedness;  provided,  however,  in  circumstances  of  default,  persons  holding  10%  of  such
financial instruments or evidences of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications. Persons who hold less than these thresholds may
be required to establish and maintain their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division. Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, are
exempt from any qualification requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business.

The  NJ  Act  imposes  certain  restrictions  upon  the  issuance,  ownership  and  transfer  of  securities  of  a  casino  licensee  and  its  holding  and  intermediary
companies  and  defines  the  term  “security”  to  include  instruments  which  evidence  a  direct  or  indirect  beneficial  ownership  or  creditor  interest,  including  stock
(common and preferred) mortgages, debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights. If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securities
is not qualified under the NJ Act, it has the

15

right to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of such securities . In the event that certain
disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power to revoke or suspend the casino license or licenses related to the
company which issued the securities . It is unlawful for a disqualified holder (i) to exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by such
securities or (ii) to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in any form, from its affiliated casino licensee for services rendered or
otherwise.

The NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified
by the NJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in the company. Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that a
holder of our securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the NJ Act. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that
we may redeem the stock of any holder found to be disqualified.

The  ability  of  a  lender  to  foreclose  on  pledged  assets,  including  gaming  equipment,  is  subject  to  compliance  with  the  NJ  Act.  Generally,  no  person  is
permitted  to  hold  an  ownership  interest  in  or  manage  a  casino  or  own  any  gaming  assets,  including  gaming  devices,  without  being  licensed.  Consequently,  any
lender  who  desires  to  enforce  a  security  interest  must  file  the  necessary  applications  for  licensure,  be  investigated,  and  either  be  found  qualified  by  the  NJ
Commission or obtain interim casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest. Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest
in a casino or of gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA
prior to obtaining any ownership interest or gaming assets.

Massachusetts
Government
Regulation

The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act (“Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing and
regulatory  requirements.  We  are  subject  to  the  Massachusetts  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  it  through  our  ownership  interest  in  Blue  Tarp
reDevelopment, LLC (“Blue Tarp”), which operates a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Under  the  Massachusetts  Act,  the  Massachusetts  Gaming  Commission  (“Massachusetts  Commission”)  is  responsible  for  issuing  licenses  under  the
Massachusetts Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau
(“IEB”), which is a Bureau within the Massachusetts Commission, is responsible for conducting administrative investigations of applicants and licensees, and for
generally enforcing the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts State
Police,  Attorney  General  and  the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Commission.  The  Massachusetts  Act  also  establishes  a  Gaming  Enforcement  Division  within  the
Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the Massachusetts Act. The Massachusetts Commission
has  the  authority  to  award  up  to  three  Category  1  licenses  (table  games  and  slot  machines),  and  one  Category  2  license  (slot  machines  only),  within  the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants.

On December 23, 2013, the Massachusetts Commission determined that Blue Tarp and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified, and on

November 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Commission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014.

Blue Tarp received its operations certificate issued by the Massachusetts Commission on September 13, 2018. That operations certificate is conditioned upon

Blue Tarp continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements.

The initial license term is 15 years, which commenced upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gaming
establishment on August 23, 2018. The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized by
the  Massachusetts  Act,  which  amount  Blue  Tarp  has  paid.  All  Category  1  and  Category  2  gaming  licensees  are  also  subject  to  additional  annual  fees  under  the
Massachusetts Act. Category 1 licensees must generally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amount
equal to 3.5 percent of the net gaming revenues derived from the establishment.

Under the Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager. Gaming beverage licenses
may be granted by the Massachusetts Commission for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except (i) between the hours of 2
a.m.  and 8 a.m. outside of the gaming area and (ii) between the hours of 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. within the gaming area. The Massachusetts Act and regulations also
describe procedures for, and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within the gaming establishment.

16

The Massachusetts Commission, in particular the IEB, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for
Category 1 and Category 2 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates,
key gaming executives and employees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the
applicant, are qualified under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission) .

After a Category 1 license is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee
and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category
1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licenses issued under
the  Massachusetts  Act  are  expressly  deemed  a  revocable  privilege,  conditioned  on  the  licensee’s  fulfillment  of  all  conditions  of  licensure,  compliance  with
applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee’s continuing qualification and suitability. Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsible
for  the  collection  of  application,  license  and  other  fees,  conducting  investigations  of  and  monitoring  applicants  and  licensees,  and  reviewing  and  ruling  on
complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.

The regulations promulgated to implement the Massachusetts Act impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to licensing and on-going
operations. The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees and vendors; accounting procedures and
internal  controls;  surveillance  and  security  requirements;  gaming  equipment,  devices  and  systems,  and  device  registration  and  testing;  self-exclusion;  on-going
reporting requirements related to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements
related to new or changes in shareholders, executives, and other qualifiers; notification and/or approval of certain material events and transactions; complimentary
services; on-going capital expenditures; political contributions; credit issuance and customer transactions; auditing and record retention; facility design and gaming
floor  plans;  slot  machine  possession  and  transportation;  table  game  rules  and  procedures;  employee  credentials;  vendors  and  junkets;  and  count  room  and  cage
procedures.

Generally,  interests  in  a  gaming  establishment  and  Category  1  licenses  may  not  be  transferred  without  notification  to  and  approval  of  the  Massachusetts
Commission. The sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and will
be ineffective if disapproved by the Massachusetts Commission. Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without the notification
and  approval  of  the  Massachusetts  Commission,  and  may  not  operate,  invest  in  or  own,  in  whole  or  in  part,  another  gaming  licensee’s  license  or  gaming
establishment.

The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to promulgate, amend or repeal regulations concerning the Massachusetts Act, which, if enacted, could
adversely  affect  the  gaming  industry  and  our  ability  to  operate  in  Massachusetts.  Further,  certain  regulations  are  currently  in  draft  form,  and  subject  to  further
review, revision and final approval.

AUDITORS’
REPORT

To the Board of Directors
CityCenter Holdings, LLC

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  CityCenter  Holdings,  LLC  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”),  which  comprise  the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America;  this  includes  the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair
presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’
Responsibility

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  auditing
standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  Company’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies  used and the  reasonableness  of significant  accounting  estimates  made  by management,  as well as evaluating  the overall  presentation  of the consolidated
financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings, LLC and
its  subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2018  and  2017,  and  the  results  of  their  operations  and  their  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended
December 31, 2018, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Emphasis
of
Matter

As discussed  in  Note 2 to  the consolidated  financial  statements,  effective  January  1, 2018, the  Company  adopted  FASB ASC 606,  Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
, on a full retrospective basis. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

ORGANIZATION
AND

BUSINESS

CITYCENTER
HOLDINGS,
LLC
NOTES
TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Organization.
CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the “Company”) is a Delaware limited liability company that owns and operates CityCenter in Las Vegas, Nevada
(“CityCenter”). The Company is a joint venture which is 50%-owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts International (together with its subsidiaries,
“MGM Resorts”),  a Delaware  corporation,  and 50%-owned by Infinity  World  Development  Corp (“Infinity  World”),  which is wholly owned  by Dubai World,  a
Dubai United Arab Emirates government decree entity (each, a “Member”). The governing document for the Company is the Third Amended and Restated Limited
Liability Company Agreement dated December 22, 2015 (the “LLC Agreement”).

Under the LLC Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of six representatives (subject to intermittent vacancies) – three selected by
each Member – and has exclusive power and authority for the overall management of the Company. Compensation for Board of Directors’ duties is borne by the
Members. The Company has no employees and has entered into several agreements with MGM Resorts to provide day-to-day management of CityCenter and the
Company. See Note 10 for further discussion of such agreements.

Nature
of
Business.
CityCenter is a mixed-use development on the Las Vegas Strip located between the Bellagio and Park MGM (which was branded as

Monte Carlo prior to May 2018) resorts, both owned by MGM Resorts. CityCenter consists of the following components:

•

•

•

Aria  Resort  &  Casino,  a  4,004-room  casino  resort  featuring  an  approximately  140,000  square-foot  casino,  approximately  500,000  square  feet  of
conference and convention space, and numerous world-class restaurants, nightclub and bars, and pool and spa amenities;

The Vdara Hotel and Spa, a luxury condominium-style hotel with 1,495 units; and

The Veer Towers, 669 units in two towers consisting entirely of luxury residential condominium units (the last of the 669 units were sold and closed
during the year ended December 31, 2016).

In August 2018, the Company closed the sale of Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas (“Mandarin Oriental”). See Note 3 for additional information related to the

sale.

In April 2016, the Company closed the sale of The Shops at Crystals (“Crystals”). See Note 3 for additional information related to the sale.

NOTE
2
—
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis
of
presentation.
 The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company  does  not  have  a
variable interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting for and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets and intangible
assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are
observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used Level 2 inputs when measuring the fair value of its interest
rate swaps. The interest rate swap values are recorded as a net unrealized gain or loss position and recognized as an asset or liability within “Other assets” or “Other
long-term obligations.” See Note 7.

5

Exhibit
99.3

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of ninety days or less at the date

of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
 The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  of
December 31, 2018, approximately 53% of the Company’s casino receivables were due from customers from foreign countries. Enforceability issues, business or
economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on a specific
review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31,
2018, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed.

Inventories.
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost

is determined primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.

Residential
real
estate.
 Residential  real  estate  represented  capitalized  costs  of  residential  inventory,  which  consisted  of  completed  condominium  units
available for sale less impairments previously recognized. Costs included land, direct and indirect construction and development costs, and capitalized property taxes
and interest. The last residential units were sold in 2016.

Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment
are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life
are  charged  to expense  as incurred.  As of December  31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued  $2.9 million  and $2.7 million,  respectively,  for property  and
equipment within accounts payable, and $0.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to construction retention within accounts payable.

Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

20 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 15 years

Project costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts to
the extent such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated
fair value.

In December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and convention
space. As a result, the Company shortened the useful lives of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $82 million
during the year ended December 31, 2016. The fully depreciated assets related to the Zarkana theatre were disposed in April 2016 and construction of the conference
and expansion space began in May 2016, which opened during the first quarter of 2018.

Capitalized
interest.
    The  interest  costs  associated  with  development  and  construction  projects  are  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  the  project.

Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Impairment
of
long-lived
assets.
The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to be
held and used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the
carrying amount of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the
carrying  amount,  then  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset,  typically  measured  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Any  recognized
impairment losses would be recorded as operating expense.

6

Exhibit
99.3

Other
assets.
The Company’s other assets include intangible assets, deposits, base stock, and other assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible
assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year . No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review.

Debt
issuance
costs
. The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalized

costs are amortized straight-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt.

Revenue
recognition.
 The  Company’s  revenue  contracts  with  customers  consist  of  casino  wager  transactions,  hotel  room  sales,  food  and  beverage

transactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.

The  transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  offers
discounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino
revenue on a portfolio basis given the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.

For  casino  wager  transactions  that  include  other  goods  and  services  provided  by  the  Company  to  gaming  patrons  on  a  discretionary  basis  to  incentivize
gaming,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  stand-alone  selling  price  (“SSP”).
Discretionary goods and services provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.

For casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty program, the Company allocates a portion of net win
based upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive.
When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deducted
from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives provided
to  gaming  customers  were  collectively  $212 million,  $190 million  and $194  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31, 2018, 2017  and  2016, respectively.  After
allocating revenue to other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue.

The  transaction  price  of  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  retail  contracts  is  the  net  amount  collected  from  the  customer  for  such  goods  and  services.  The
transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is
made for the food and beverage and retail and other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts
as an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well as
customer rooms arranged by online travel agents.

The Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with
hotel  stays  and  convention  services.  For  such  arrangements,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  to  each  good  or  service  based  on  its  relative  SSP.  The  Company
primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold
separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.

Contract
and
Contract-Related
Liabilities.
There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,
resulting  in  a  contract  or  contract-related  liability. The  Company generally has  three  types of  liabilities  related  to  contracts  with  customers:  (1)  outstanding chip
liability,  which  represents  the  amounts  owned  in  exchange  for  gaming  chips  held  by  a  customer,  (2)  loyalty  program  obligations,  which  represents  the  deferred
allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by
customers  before  gaming  play  occurs  (“casino  front  money”)  and  advance  payments  on  goods  and  services  yet  to  be  provided  such  as  advance  ticket  sales  and
deposits  on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  being
purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue
by
source.
The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, rooms, food and beverage,
and entertainment, retail, residential and other). Lease revenues earned by the Company from third-parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the
type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues include $3 million, $3 million and $4 million recorded within food and beverage revenue for the years
ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,  respectively,  and  $3  million,  $2  million  and  $3  million  recorded  within  entertainment,  retail,  residential  and  other
revenue for the same such periods, respectively.

Real
estate
sales.
Revenue for residential sales is deferred until closing occurs, which is when title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been
transferred to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment must be
adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination.

Residential  operating  expenses  include  cost  of  real  estate  sold,  holding  costs,  selling  costs,  indirect  selling  costs  and  valuation  allowances  for  residential
mortgage notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrative
expense, which were expensed as incurred.

Advertising.
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is included in preopening and start-up
expenses when related to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations. Advertising expense was
$15 million, $14 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and

gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Income
taxes.
 The  Company  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Therefore,  federal  income  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of  the

Members. As a result, no provision for income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals comprehensive income (loss) for all years presented.

Reclassification
of
prior
year
balances.
Reclassifications were made to the prior-period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period

presentation.

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
In May 2014, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”)
606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”) which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under the standard,
revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in
exchange for those goods and services.

The Company adopted ASC 606 on a full retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts of the adoption of the new accounting

pronouncement are as follows:

8

Exhibit
99.3

•

•

•

•

Promotional  Allowances.  The  Company  no  longer  recognizes  revenues  for  goods  and  services  provided  to  customers  for  free  as  an  inducement  to
gamble as gross revenue with a corresponding offset to promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues, and accordingly the promotional allowances
line  item  has  been  removed.  The  majority  of  such  amounts  previously  included  in  promotional  allowances  now  offset  casino  revenues  based  on  an
allocation of revenues to performance obligations using SSP . This change resulted in a reclassification of revenue between revenue line items;

Loyalty Accounting. As discussed within Revenue
Recognition
above, the outstanding performance obligations of the loyalty program liability are now
recognized at retail value of such benefits owed to the customer (less estimated breakage). This change resulted in a decrease to retained earnings as of
January 1, 2016 of $4 million, with a corresponding increase primarily to “Due to MGM Resorts International,” as a result of the initial application of
the standard and did not have a significant impact to other balance sheet accounts or earnings;

Gross versus Net Presentation. Mandatory service charges on food and beverage and wide area progressive operator fees are recorded gross, that is, the
amount  received  from  the  customer  will  be  recorded  as  revenue  with  the  corresponding  amount  paid  as  an  expense.  These  changes  resulted  in  an
increase in revenue with a corresponding increase in expense; and

Estimated Cost of Promotional Allowances. The Company no longer reclassifies the estimated cost of complimentaries provided to the gaming patron
from other expense line items to the casino expense line item. This change resulted in a reclassification between expense line items.

These changes, and other less significant adjustments that were required upon adoption, did not have an aggregate material impact on net income or cash

flows. The following table shows the increase/(decrease) to the Company’s 2017 and 2016 income statement line items as follows:

Revenues

Rooms

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842, “Leases (Topic 842),” which replaces the existing guidance in Topic 840, “Leases,” (“ASC 842”). ASC 842 is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under
which  a  lessee  would  classify  and  account  for  its  lease  agreements  as  either  finance  or  operating.  Both  finance  and  operating  leases  will  result  in  the  lessee
recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee will recognize interest expense associated with the lease
liability and depreciation expense associated with the ROU asset, and for operating leases, the lessee will recognize straight-line rent expense. The Company will
adopt ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 utilizing the simplified transition method and accordingly will not recast comparative period financial information. The Company
will elect the basket of transition practical expedients which includes not needing to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2)
the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also currently expects that the most significant
impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that exist at the Company on the date of adoption.

In  January  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  No.  2016-15,  “Statement  of  Cash  Flows  (Topic  230):  Classification  of

Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”).

ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of
ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flow
issues. The adoption of 2016-15 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

events.
Management has evaluated subsequent events through February 19, 2019, the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

OPERATIONS

In August 2018, the Company closed the sale of Mandarin Oriental, a hotel with adjacent retail and food and beverage outlets, to Lamco Fund I, LLC for
approximately $214 million. The Company recognized a loss of $133 million on the sale, which is included within “Income (loss) from discontinued operations,” for
the  year  ended  December  31,  2018.  The  results  of  Mandarin  Oriental  are  classified  as  discontinued  operations  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 as the sale was a strategic shift in business. The 2017 and 2016 consolidated statements of cash
flows have not been adjusted to reflect discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities of Mandarin Oriental are classified as held for sale as of December 31,
2017.

In April 2016, the Company closed the sale of Crystals, a retail, dining and entertainment district, to a venture led by Invesco Real Estate and Simon Property
Group  for  approximately  $1.1  billion.  The  Company  recognized  a  gain  of  $400  million  on  the  sale,  which  is  included  within  “Income  (loss)  from  discontinued
operations,” for the year ended December 31, 2016. The results of Crystals are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 as the sale of Crystals was a strategic shift in business.

The cash flows of discontinued operations are included with the cash flows of continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash
flows.  Capital  expenditures  related  to  discontinued  operations  were  $0,  $1  million  and  $2  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2018,  2017  and  2016,
respectively.

Senior
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2018, the senior credit facility consisted of $1.8 billion of term loans and a $125 million revolving credit facility.
The  term  loan  B  facility  will  mature  in  April  2024  and  the  revolving  credit  facility  will  mature  in  April  2022.    In  May  2018,  the  Company  amended  its  credit
agreement to provide for a $200 million increase in the term loan B facility and repriced its term loan B interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a LIBOR floor of
0.75%.  Additionally, the term loan B facility is subject to quarterly amortization payments of approximately $5 million beginning in June 2018 through March 2024
with  the  remaining  balance  due  in  April  2024.  During  the  year  ended  December  31, 2018,  the  Company  permanently  repaid  $14 million  in  accordance  with  the
scheduled  amortization  payments.  As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  interest  rate  on  the  term  loan  B  was  4.77%.  Loans  under  the  revolving  facility  bear  interest  at
LIBOR plus 2.00%. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had not drawn on the revolving facility. The Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375%, for the unused
portion of the revolving facility. In connection with the amendment of the senior credit facility, the Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term debt of $0.7
million, primarily consisting of the write-off of a portion of previously unamortized debt issuance costs.

The senior credit facility is a general senior obligation of the Company and ranks equally with the Company’s other existing and future senior obligations, is
fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  on  a  senior  secured  basis  by  the  restricted  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  is  secured  by  a  first-priority  perfected  lien  on
substantially all of the Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries.

The  senior  credit  facility  contains  customary  positive,  negative  and  financial  covenants,  including  a  requirement  that  the  Company  maintains  a  quarterly
minimum  interest  coverage  ratio  of  2.5:1.0  and  a  maximum  quarterly  leverage  ratio  for  the  trailing  four  quarters  of  5.00:1.00  for  December  31,  2018  and
thereafter.  The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2018.

Pursuant to the senior credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayments of principal based on an annual calculation of excess cash flow,
as defined in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal year, with
50% required to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0 and greater
than 4.0:1.0, and no payment of excess cash flow is required if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0. During 2018 and 2017 and as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, the Company did not have excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior credit agreement for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Fair
value
of
long-term
debt.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 201 8 and 201 7 was approximately $ 1.66

billion and $1. 58 billion, respectively, and was determined using estimates based on trading prices of similar liabilities, a Level 2 input.

Maturities
of
long-term
debt.
As of December 31, 2018, maturities of the Company’s long-term debt were as follows:

In order to manage interest rate risk inherent in its variable rate debt, the Company hedges the interest rate on the term loan under its senior credit facility.
The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements effective December 31, 2018 with a notional value of $900 million and a maturity date of December 31,
2023. The fixed rate paid is 2.73% and the variable rate received resets monthly to the greater of one-month LIBOR or 0.75%.

As  of  December  31,  2018,  the  interest  rate  swaps  were  valued  in  a  net  unrealized  loss  position  and  recognized  as  a  liability  within  “Other  long-term
obligations.” For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an $8 million loss related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps in “Other,
net.”

COMMITMENTS
AND
CONTINGENCIES

NV
Energy.
In July 2016, MGM Resorts, including the Company, filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchase
energy, capacity, and/or ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. In September 2016, the Company paid an upfront impact payment of $14 million,
of which $2 million was billed to third party entities and represented a reduction in the overall impact fee expense. Of this $2 million receivable for amounts billed to
third  party  entities,  $1  million  is  included  in  Accounts  receivable,  net  as  of  both  December  31,  2018  and  2017.  Additionally,  the  Company  is  required  to  make
ongoing payments to NV Energy for non-bypassable rate charges which primarily relate to its share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which
extend through 2040 and each entity’s share of the costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. During 2017, the terms of the
ongoing  impact  fee  obligations  were  modified.  Such  modifications  included  a  credit  to  be  applied  against  future  non-bypassable  rate  charges  and  substantially
shortened the period over which MGM Resorts, including the Company, is responsible for such charges, with an end date in 2022. As such, the Company recognized
a  reduction  in  its  liability  for  future  charges  of  $8  million  with  a  corresponding  credit  to  “NV  Energy  exit  expense.”  As  of  December  31,  2018,  and  2017,  the
Company recorded an estimate of such liability on a discounted basis of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in “Due to MGM Resorts International” and $2
million and $4 million, respectively, in “Other long-term obligations.”

Other
litigation.
 The  Company  is  a  party  to  various  legal  proceedings  that  relate  to  construction  and  operational  matters  incidental  to  its  business.
Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The
Company maintained an owner controlled insurance program (OCIP) during the construction and development process. Under the OCIP, certain insurance coverages
may cover a portion of the Company’s general liability, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities.

13

Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit
issued  by  financial  institutions.  The  Company’s  available  borrowing  capacity  under  the  senior  credit  facility  is  reduced  by  any  outstanding  letters  of  credit.    At
December  31,  201  8  ,  the  Company  had  $9  million  in  a  letter  of  credit  outstanding.  Additionally,  as  of  December  31,  2018  the  Company  had  $8  million  of
obligations related to professional services and maintenance contracts.

Leases
where
the
Company
is
a
lessee.
 The  Company  is  party  to  various  leases  for  real  estate  and  equipment  under  operating  lease  arrangements.  In

December 2018, the Company entered into a capital lease for Information Technology equipment, which is amortized on a straight line basis over 5 years.

The expected fixed future minimum lease payments associated with this capital lease as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:

The Company’s other future minimum obligations under non-cancellable leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total.

Leases
where
the
Company
is
a
lessor.
The Company enters into operating leases related to retail, dining and entertainment venues. As of December 31,
2018, the Company has 16 such leases in place. Tenants are primarily responsible for tenant improvements, though the Company provides construction allowances
to  certain  lessees.  Leases  include  base  rent,  common  area  maintenance  charges  and,  in  some  cases,  percentage  rent  based  on  the  sales  of  the  lessee.  Payments
received related to fixed future minimum leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total.

Several leases contain terms that are based on meeting certain operational criteria. Contingent rentals included in income were $3

million, $2 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
