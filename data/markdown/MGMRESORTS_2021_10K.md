ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

PART I

MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred
to  as  “we,”  “us”  or  “our.”  MGM  China  Holdings  Limited  together  with  its  subsidiaries  is  referred  to  as  “MGM  China.”  Except  where  the  context  indicates
otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview

MGM  Resorts  International  is  a  Delaware  corporation  incorporated  in  1986  that  acts  largely  as  a  holding  company  and,  through  subsidiaries,  owns  and

operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.

We believe we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We
make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features
and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their
respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its
businesses are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2021, we
lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage,
Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours
and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating
Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the
master lease with MGP, which eliminates in consolidation.

We lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 5% owned by such subsidiary and
95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”). We lease the real estate
assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 50.1% owned by a subsidiary
of  the  Operating  Partnership  and  49.9%  owned  by  a  subsidiary  of  BREIT  (such  venture,  the  “MGP  BREIT  Venture”).  We  lease  the  real  estate  assets  of  Aria
(including Vdara) pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. ("Blackstone"). Refer to Note 11
for further discussion of these leases.

Business Developments

In recent years, in furtherance of our vision to be the world’s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model,
which has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital to
be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued to
focus on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM, expanding our
digital capabilities, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.

As part of that business strategy, we have sought, and executed on, opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, or

enter into venture transactions with respect to the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts, including through the following transactions:

•

•

In  July  2018,  we  and  Entain  plc  (“Entain”)  formed  BetMGM,  LLC  (“BetMGM”),  a  venture  that  is  owned  50%  by  each  party.  In  connection  with  its
formation, we provided BetMGM with exclusive access to all of our domestic landbased and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online
gaming operations and Entain provided BetMGM with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.

In  January  2019,  we  acquired  the  real  property  and  operations  associated  with  Empire  City  Casino's  racetrack  and  casino  ("Empire  City")  for  total
consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired

1

Empire City’s developed real property from us and Empire City was added to the master lease between us and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for
additional information.

In  March  2019,  we  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  master  lease  between  us  and  MGP  with  respect  to  improvements  made  by  us  related  to  the
rebranding  of  the  Park  MGM  and  NoMad  Las  Vegas  property  (the  “Park  MGM  Transaction”).  Refer  to  Note  18  for  additional  information  on  this
transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.

Additionally, in November 2019, Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us for total consideration of
$4.25 billion, and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease and Note
12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.

In December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million. See Note 16 for additional information related
to this transaction.

On  February  14,  2020,  we  completed  a  series  of  transactions  (collectively  the  “MGP  BREIT  Venture  Transaction”)  pursuant  to  which  the  real  estate
assets  of  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  and  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Mandalay  Place)  were  contributed  to  the  newly  formed  MGP  BREIT  Venture  in
exchange  for  total  consideration  of  $4.6  billion.  See  Note  1  for  further  discussion  on  the  transaction  and  Note  12  for  the  guarantee  entered  into  in
connection with the transaction.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay
and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under
the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18. Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease.

Also,  on  January  14,  2020,  we,  the  Operating  Partnership,  and  MGP  entered  into  a  waiver  agreement  pursuant  to  which  approximately  30  million
Operating Partnership units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on May 18, 2020 and approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that
we held were redeemed for $700 million on December 2, 2020. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms. Refer to Note 1 for further
information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.

On March 4, 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million Operating Partnership units that we held which was
satisfied  with  aggregate  cash  proceeds  of  approximately  $1.2  billion,  using  cash  on  hand  together  with  the  proceeds  from  MGP's  issuance  of  Class  A
shares. See Note 13 for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.

On August 4, 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock
transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued
VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI operating partnership (“VICI OP”) in
exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of our VICI OP units for
cash consideration of $4.4 billion. MGP’s Class B share that is held by us will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amended and
restated  master  lease  with  VICI.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  first  half  of  2022,  subject  to  customary  closing  conditions,  regulatory
approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). Refer to Note 1 for further information.

On  September  26,  2021,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  operations  of  The  Cosmopolitan  of  Las  Vegas  ("The  Cosmopolitan")  for  cash
consideration of $1.625 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Additionally, the Company will enter into a lease agreement for the
real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

On September 27, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC ("CityCenter") held by Infinity World
Development Corp ("Infinity World"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity, for cash
consideration of $2.125 billion. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.

On September 28, 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) to funds managed by Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.89 billion
and  entered  into  a  lease  through  which  the  real  property  is  leased  back  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Refer  to  Note  11  for  discussion  of  the  lease
agreement.

On September 28, 2021, we announced that we, together with our venture partner, ORIX Corporation ("ORIX"), were selected by Osaka as the region’s
integrated resort partner. In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, through which we will bid to develop one of Japan's first integrated resorts.

On October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us for cash consideration of $400 million and MGM Springfield was
added to the MGP master lease between us and MGP through which MGP leases back the real property to a subsidiary of ours. Transactions with MGP,
including transactions  under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated  in our consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the
master lease with MGP.

On  December  13,  2021,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  sell  the  operations  of  The  Mirage  to  an  affiliate  of  Seminole  Hard  Rock Entertainment,  Inc.
("Hard Rock") for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI
(or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction is terminated) will be amended and restated to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. The
transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or
termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

For  additional  information  relating  to  our  acquisitions,  divestitures,  venture  transactions,  and  other  arrangements,  including  those  referred  to  above,  see

specified above.

Financial Impact of COVID-19. See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Description of
our business and key performance indicators — Financial Impact of COVID-19” for more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business
and our recovery. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry,
and Market Conditions.”

Resort Operations

General

Most  of  our  revenue  is  cash-based,  through  customers  wagering  with  cash  or  paying  for  non-gaming  services  with  cash  or  credit  cards.  We  rely  on  the
ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments,
and repay debt financings.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19,
typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of
factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and
special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and
hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or
leased to third parties. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  have  three  reportable  segments:  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations,  and  MGM  China,  as  generally  described

below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon acquisition in September 2021),
Bellagio,  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  (including  The  Signature),  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Delano  and  Four  Seasons),  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York
(including The Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).

Regional Operations. Regional  Operations  consists  of  the  following  casino  resorts:  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,

Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New

3

Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon
its acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).

Over  half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  is  typically  derived  from  non-gaming  operations,  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,
entertainment  and  other  non-gaming  amenities  and  the  majority  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  Regional  Operations  is  typically  derived  from  gaming  operations.
Although our domestic customer mix has changed in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term strategy continues to be to market to
different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads
to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for
our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games, and, through BetMGM, we offer online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions
in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  we  provide  our  premium  players  access  to  high-limit  rooms  and  lounge  experiences  where  players  may  enjoy  an  upscale
atmosphere.

MGM China

We  own  approximately  56%  of  MGM  China,  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM  Grand  Paradise”),  the  Macau  company  that  owns  and
operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in
MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach  internationally  and will foster future growth and profitability.  Although visitation during 2020 and
2021 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at
MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from
gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. The Macau government has
granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by
SJM Resorts S.A. ("SJMSA", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), which expires in June 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additional
concessions  and  subconcessions,  but  does  not  place  a  limit  on  the  number  of  casinos  or  gaming  areas  operated  by  the  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires,
though  additional  casinos  or  gaming  areas  require  government  approval  prior  to  commencing  operations.  See  “Risk  Factors  —  Risks  Related  to  our  Macau
Operations  —  The  Macau  government  can  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating  MGM  Grand
Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or
MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”

As discussed above, gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires
and  three  subconcessionaires,  of  which  a  subsidiary  of  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  is  a  subconcessionaire.  In  2019,  the  expiration  of  MGM  Grand
Paradise's  subconcession  term  was  extended  from  March  31,  2020  to  June  26,  2022,  consistent  with  the  expiration  of  the  other  concessionaires  and
subconcessionaires. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one
or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content
of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September
2021.  Under  the  bill,  the  existing  subconcessions  will  be  discontinued  and  a  maximum  of  six  concessions  will  be  awarded  for  a  term  to  be  specified  in  the
concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval
by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to
date  the  Macau  Government  has  provided  no  indication  as  to  whether  the  public  tender  will  take  place  before  expiry  of  the  existing  gaming  concessions  and
subconcessions but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender
is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the
casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM
Grand Paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation
or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business,
properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and an
event of default under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. MGM

4

China  continues  to  closely  monitor  developments  regarding  the  retendering  process  or  concession  extensions  including  the  issuance  of  guidance  by  the  Macau
Government.  MGM China  intends  to  respond  proactively  to  all  relevant  Macau  Government  requirements  when known relating  to the  retendering  process.  We
cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that we will be able to obtain a gaming concession in a
public tender; however, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held.

Corporate and Other

We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. Our
unconsolidated  affiliates  include  the  ventures  with  BREIT,  discussed  elsewhere,  and  BetMGM.  In  September  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  50%
ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest
in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.

Customers and Competition

Our properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in
which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete
to  a  lesser  extent  with  state-sponsored  lotteries,  off-track  wagering,  card  parlors,  iGaming  and  other  forms  of  legalized  gaming  in  the  United  States  and
internationally.  For  further  discussion  of  the  potential  impact  of  competitive  conditions  on  our  business,  see  “Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  —  Risks  Related  to  our
Business, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in
the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

•
•

•
•
•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining,
entertainment, retail and other amenities;
Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions,
trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure
and  value-oriented  tour  and  travel  customers.  Many  of  our  properties  have  significant  convention  and  meeting  space  which  we  utilize  to  drive  business  to  our
properties during midweek and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or
near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos  in the downtown area, which is about five miles  from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel
casinos  elsewhere  in the Las  Vegas area.  Our  Las Vegas Strip  Resorts  also compete,  in part,  with  each  other.  Major  competitors,  including  new entrants,  have
either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas.
Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where

location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.

MGM China

The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP
gaming play has historically been sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play was obtained through external gaming promoters
who  assist  VIP  players  with  their  travel  and  entertainment  arrangements.  Gaming  promoters  have  been  compensated  through  payment  of  revenue-sharing
arrangements  and  rolling  chip  turnover-based  commissions.  In-house  VIP  players  also  typically  receive  a  commission  based  on  the  program  in  which  they
participate.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profit  contribution  from  the  main  floor
gaming operations has historically exceeded the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract players
such  as  premium  gaming  lounges  and  stadium-style  electronic  table  games  terminals,  which  include  both  table  games  and  slots  to  create  a  dedicated  exclusive
gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end
customers.

VIP  gaming  at  MGM  China  is  conducted  by  the  use  of  special  purpose  nonnegotiable  gaming  chips.  Gaming  promoters  currently  purchase  these
nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming
promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are currently based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a
percentage  of  the  table  games  turnover  they  generate.  They  also  receive  a  complimentary  allowance  based  on  a  percentage  of  the  table  games  turnover  they
generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary

7

customer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of
rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.

In December 2021, we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters. In January 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to
amend the gaming law which includes some restrictions relating to gaming promoters, including: each gaming promoter can only exercise the activity of gaming
promotion for one concessionaire, revenue sharing arrangements between concessionaires and gaming promoters are prohibited, gaming promoters are prohibited
from having exclusive operation of casino reserved areas, and gaming promoters are restricted to only providing support to the concessionaires in the promotion of
casino gaming activities through commissions. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly.

We have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly, we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source of
revenue  in  future  years.  The  majority  of  MGM  China's  casino  revenue  has  been  provided  by  main  floor  gaming  operations  in  recent  years  and  we  expect  this
customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future.

Our  key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additional
concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai
Strip.

We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South

Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.

Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and
in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We
also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that
identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and
help build lasting customer relationships.

MGM Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both
gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. In January 2022, we redesigned our loyalty program to
expand the ways in which our customers can earn benefits. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at
MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that
the  resorts  provide.  Our  loyalty  programs  focus  on  building  a  rewarding  relationship  with  our  customers,  encouraging  members  to  increase  both  visitation  and
spend.

Strategy

We  strive  to  be  a  leader  in  the  global  gaming,  entertainment  and  hospitality  industry  that  delivers  extraordinary  entertainment  across  a  portfolio  of
properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and
globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes
Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.

In  order  to  achieve  our  vision  of  becoming  the  world's  premier  gaming  entertainment  company,  we  developed  our  strategic  plan,  which  centers  on  four

pillars:

•
•

Strong People and Culture. Recruit, develop and retain the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience.
Customer-Centric  Model. Leverage  a  customer-centric  model  reinforced  by  a  strong  brand  and  deep  customer  insights  to  provide  unmatched
entertainment experiences for our guests and drive top-line growth.

• Operational Excellence. Operating  model  refinement  to  maximize  operating  efficiencies  and  expand  margins.  Enhancement  of  digital  capabilities  to

•

strengthen customer loyalty.
Disciplined  Capital  Allocation  to  Maximize  Shareholder  Value.  Pursuit  of  targeted,  attractive  ROI  opportunities  that  align  to  our  strategic  vision.
Focus on shareholder returns. Fortify balance sheet.

8

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rapidly changing environment, our strategic direction must allow for flexibility. The strategic plan was

developed with the intent to regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities,
debt repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide
profitable returns.

We regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership,
management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. We also leverage our management expertise and
well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects
in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

We  continue  to  invest  in  our  operating  model  by  expanding  the  footprint  of  our  Centers  of  Excellence  and  enabling  best  in  class  operations  through
adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor,
sourcing, and revenue programs that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.

We have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan and investing in BetMGM. In September 2021, we,
together with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-term
bid to develop one of Japan’s first integrated casino resorts. We are currently working with Osaka to submit an area development plan to the central government
during the application period. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming
industries. As part of our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-
property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Further, we continue to explore
bringing full-scale commercial gaming to Empire City in New York.

Technology

We  believe  technology,  digital  and  advanced  data  science/analytics  capabilities  are  critical  to  optimizing  customer  experience  and  loyalty,  employee
productivity and engagement, operational efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating ‘only at
MGM’ differentiation through unique content and experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversification
through enhanced e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting businesses, creating cross-
property experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspects
of our business for faster decision making, and optimizing our operations and employee productivity and experience through digitization.

Environmental & Social Responsibility

At MGM Resorts we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board
committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these topics by uniting our key pillars of Diversity and
Inclusion,  Philanthropy  and  Community  Engagement  and  Environmental  Sustainability  under  one  Executive  Committee-level  leader  who  manages  the  MGM
Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR and
Sustainability board committee. This leader now also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance
(“ESG”) considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization.

The year 2021 was a critical one in terms of progress on our ESG initiatives. In May 2021, we published our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Report
containing our most robust ESG disclosures to date. In this report we showed the significant progress made towards many of our ESG goals that we had announced
publicly in prior reports, and we expect to publish a report in 2022 reflecting our progress on these goals during 2021.

Importantly, 2021 saw the opening of the 100MW “MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array” in North Las Vegas. This is the hospitality industry’s largest direct-
connect  renewable  electricity  project  world-wide  and  has  significantly  improved  our  trajectory  to  achieve  our  previously  announced  carbon  reduction  goals.  In
connection with the opening of this array, we enhanced our climate ambition by announcing two new 2030 goals: to cut global total operational carbon emissions
by

9

50%, and source 100% renewable electricity in the USA. Beyond the environmental benefits associated with the renewable electricity generated, the array will also
help us hedge our electricity costs and reduce our exposure to price volatility risks.

In  2021,  we  also  made  substantial  progress  against  our  commitment  to  aligning  more  of  our  ESG  report  disclosures  to  leading  ESG  frameworks  by
publishing  our  first  ever  disclosures  informed  by  guidelines  of  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI)  and  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB)
Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming Sector Standards.

Our  full  list  of  ESG  goals  and  performance  against  them  are  available  in  our  2020  Social  Impact  &  Sustainability  Report,  available  at
mgmresorts.com/focused.  The  content  on  this  website  and  report  is  for  informational  purposes  only  and  such  content  is  not  incorporated  by  reference  into  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Trademarks

Our  principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Aria,  Vdara,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Borgata,  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM
Grand,  MGM  Resorts  International,  Luxor,  Excalibur,  New  York-New  York,  Beau  Rivage  and  Empire  City,  all  of  which  have  been  registered  or  allowed  in
various  classes  in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  we  have  also  registered  or  applied  to  register  numerous  other  trademarks  in  connection  with  our  properties,
facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our
properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe
that  the  name  recognition,  reputation  and  image  that  we  have  developed  attract  customers  to  our  facilities.  Once  granted,  our  trademark  registrations  are  of
perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals
for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.

Human Capital

We  are  focused  on  fostering  a  people-driven  culture  exemplified  by  how  we  lead  and  uphold  our  core  values,  which  in  2021  evolved  to:  captivate  our
audience,  inspire  excellence,  champion  inclusion,  and  win  together,  to  create  an  engaged  and  diverse  workforce.  Our  long-term  people  strategy  is  designed  to
enhance  talent  attraction  and  development  to  support  business  objectives,  guest  experience,  community  engagement,  and  financial  goals.  Our  workforce
development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community
training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs.

Growth and Development

We  invest  significant  resources  to  develop  the  talent  needed,  now  and  in  the  future,  to  continue  to  be  a  premier  employer  of  choice  across  the  gaming,
hospitality,  and entertainment  industries.  We are committed  to a culture  of continuous  learning  where employees,  at all levels,  are  engaged  in developing  their
knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  and  we support  the  long-term  career  aspirations  of  our  employees  through  education  and  professional/personal  development.  In
2021, we introduced several new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee segments. Except as otherwise temporarily impacted
due  to  COVID-19,  we  offer  tuition  reimbursement,  contribute  toward  student  loan  debt  repayment,  and  have  partnered  with  the  Nevada  System  of  Higher
Education to allow employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours.

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (“ED&I”)

Our  approach  to  ED&I  is  anchored  by  our  corporate  and  people  strategies  and  a  social  impact  and  sustainability  approach  that  centers  on  embracing
humanity  and  protecting  the  planet.  A  concise  framework  lays  out  four  strategic  pillars  to  guide  our  work:  invest  in  people;  build  an  inclusive  culture;  grow
business and customer  engagement  and supplier diversity;  and, enhance marketplace  leadership  and community  relations.  As part of our commitment,  we have
committed  to  the  following  four  long-range  goals:  (1)  ensure  that  all  employees  have  equal  access  to  leadership  opportunities,  (2)  spend  at  least  10%  of  our
biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 50 graduates and (4) train 100% of management
employees  on  social  impact  policies  and  goals.  In  connection  with  each  goal,  we  have  established  robust  key  performance  indicators,  which  are  tracked  and
published  in  our  annual  Social  Impact  and  Sustainability  Report.In  addition,  we  have  detailed  internal  Human  Capital  workforce  reports,  which  include
demographic  and  diversity  data,  and  are  reviewed  with  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  and  Sustainability  Committee  of  the  Board,  leadership  teams  and
executive management on a regular basis.

10

Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance our core value of inclusiveness. The channels include but are

not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.

Work  in  the  area  of  equity,  diversity  and  inclusion  is  advanced  through  a  range  of  programs  and  initiatives  which  include  education  and  training,
community  partnerships,  recruitment  and  talent  development,  advocacy,  engagement  and  outreach.  Responsibility  is  driven  and  led  by  the  Company’s  Chief
People,  Inclusion  and  Sustainability  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  President,  and  is  supported  by  a  centralized  diversity  and
inclusion team and the Human Resources department.

Health, Safety, and Wellness

In  order  to  promote  our  culture  of  overall  employee  health  and  wellness  we  provide  benefits,  tools  and  resources  to  help  maintain  or  improve  physical,
mental,  and  financial  health.  We  continue  to  align  benefit  offerings  to  the  needs  of  a  diverse  workforce  across  an  expanded  regional  presence  and  leverage
innovative  solutions  to expand access  to health  and wellness resources,  including  the recent  addition of a service  to help connect LGBTQIA+ people  and their
loved ones with culturally and clinically competent health care providers.

To ensure our employees' continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19, we coordinated with medical experts to put in place extensive
testing protocols for our employees and required COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment for all salaried employees and new hires throughout the
United States. As a commitment to our employees impacted by the pandemic, we have maintained benefits eligibility for many employees who were furloughed in
2020 and were unable to work enough hours to qualify for benefits until business conditions improved.

Community Engagement and Philanthropy

Our philanthropic focus centers around: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet. We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillars
of caring for one another and investing in the community. We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees to
contribute to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community
Grant, which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all of our employees to
volunteer through a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs such
as VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with opportunities to earn grant money to their charity of choice based on volunteer hours.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 10,000
employees  at  MGM  China.  We  had  collective  bargaining  agreements  with  unions  covering  approximately  35,000  of  our  employees  as  of  December  31,  2021.
Collective bargaining agreements covering multiple bargaining units at our Regional Operations and Las Vegas Strip Resorts are scheduled to expire in 2022. This
includes all bargaining units at Gold Strike Tunica in Mississippi, all bargaining units at Borgata in Atlantic City, our hotel/food & beverage bargaining unit at
MGM National Harbor, and all valet operations in Las Vegas (with the exception of The Signature). Negotiations for successor contracts covering those employees
are being scheduled as expiration dates approach and will continue throughout 2022. As of December 31, 2021, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a
labor union and the MGM China resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Government Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject
to  extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  it  is  located.  These  laws,  rules  and  regulations  generally  concern  the
responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one
jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which

Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our  businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  in  general.  These  laws  and  regulations
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  smoking,  employees,  currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and
building codes (including regulations under

11

the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  which  requires  all  public  accommodations  to  meet  certain  federal  requirements  related  to  access  and  use  by  persons  with
disabilities),  construction,  land  use  and  marketing  and  advertising.  We  also  deal  with  significant  amounts  of  cash  in  our  operations  and  are  subject  to  various
reporting  and  anti-money  laundering  regulations.  Such  laws  and  regulations  could  change  or  could  be  interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  and
regulations  could  be  enacted.  Material  changes,  new  laws  or  regulations,  or  material  differences  in  interpretations  by  courts  or  governmental  authorities  could
adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for,
the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on us or the results of our operations.

For a discussion of potential risks to our business relating to regulatory matters, including due to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory changes,

please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy.”

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or
assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic, business,
competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments under our triple-net leases and
guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our development options and
financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations;
current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant
financial commitments, including the fixed components of our rent payments, and to make planned expenditures;
restrictions  and limitations  in the agreements  governing our senior credit  facility  and other senior indebtedness  could significantly  affect  our ability  to
operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity;
the fact that we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and
growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes;
the  VICI Transaction,  The  Cosmopolitan  transaction,  and  The  Mirage  transaction  each  remain  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  certain  closing  conditions,
including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may
not be realized at all;
potential  litigation  instituted  against  us,  our  transaction  counterparties,  or  our  respective  directors  challenging  the  VICI  Transaction  may  prevent  such
transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all;

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the
SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully,
among other things, the risks described below.

Summary of Risk Factors

The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.

Risks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments

•

•

•

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide on
the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability
to satisfy our obligations.
Current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant
financial commitments or make planned expenditures.
The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our
ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.

• We  are  required  to  pay  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flows  as  rent,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and  growth

initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.

Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions

•

•

The VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction, and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,
including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may
not be realized at all.
The potential litigation instituted against us, our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the VICI Transaction may prevent such
transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions

•

The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last
for an unknown period of time.

• We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete,
including  increased  competition  through  online  sports  betting  and  iGaming,  and  failure  to  compete  effectively  could  materially  adversely  affect  our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.

•
• We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan.

15

•

•

•

•

•

Our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding
company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.
All of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination,
lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations.
Paul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may
have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP.
Despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has
adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in
accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.
Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company
that is more geographically diversified.

•
•

•

• We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.
• We may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.
•

Leisure  and  business  travel,  especially  travel  by  air,  are  particularly  susceptible  to  global  geopolitical  events,  such  as  terrorist  attacks,  other  acts  of
violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases.
Co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk.
Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a
material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and
we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future.
Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.
A significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.

•
•
•
• We may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some

•

of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful.
The failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines,
payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.

• We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.
• We are subject to risks and costs related to climate change.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy

•

•
•
•

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business
and results of operations.
Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.
If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.
The future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred
tax asset may change materially in future periods.

• We face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us.

Risks Related to Our Macau Operations

• We have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China.
The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise,
•
exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or
MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of

16

which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

• We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.
•

Conflicts  of  interest  may  arise  because  certain  of  our  directors  and  officers  are  also  directors  of  MGM  China,  the  holding  company  for  MGM  Grand
Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.

Risks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide of
the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to
satisfy our obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12.9 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis,
including $4.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the
interest  rates  applicable  to  our  existing  or  future  borrowings  would  increase  the  cost  of  our  indebtedness  and  reduce  the  cash  flow  available  to  fund  our  other
liquidity needs. We do not guarantee  MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations  under their respective  debt agreements and, to the extent MGM
China or the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such
entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:

•
•
•

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business
strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;

• making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

We currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid
thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain
remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the
debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future.
If we do not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be
no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest
significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (with
annual  escalators)  and  also  require  us  to  apply  a  percentage  of  net  revenues  generated  at  the  leased  properties  to  capital  expenditures  at  those  properties.  Such
investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or
otherwise  obtained.  Similarly,  development  projects,  including  any  potential  future  development  of  an  integrated  resort  in  Japan,  strategic  initiatives,  including
positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional
debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Current  and  future  economic,  capital  and  credit  market  conditions  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  service  our  substantial  indebtedness  and
significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures. Our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial
commitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to
generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries (including MGM China and the Operating Partnership), and borrow
under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. In 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant deterioration to the global economy,
and substantial declines in our revenues from operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries. We expect that the recent

17

emergence and global spread of COVID-19 variants may continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2022 and potentially thereafter, and if we fail to generate
cash  sufficient  to  fund  our  liquidity  needs  or  satisfy  the  financial  and  other  covenants  in  our  debt  and  lease  instruments,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  future
borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity
needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.

In  addition,  we  have  a  significant  amount  of  indebtedness  maturing  in  2022,  and  thereafter.  Our  ability  to  fund  or  timely  refinance  and  replace  our
indebtedness  will depend upon the economic  and credit  market  conditions  discussed above. If we are unable to fund or refinance  our indebtedness  on a timely
basis,  we  might  be  forced  to  seek  alternate  forms  of  financing,  dispose  of  certain  assets  or  minimize  capital  expenditures  and  other  investments.  There  is  no
assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that
would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases.

The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our
ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. Covenants governing
our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;
incur additional debt;
incur liens on assets;
sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
enter into transactions with affiliates;
allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise
waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-
defaults  under  other  agreements  governing  our  long-term  indebtedness.  Any  default  under  our  senior  credit  facility  or  the  indentures  governing  our  other  debt
could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.

In  addition,  each  of  MGM  China  and  the  Operating  Partnership  has  issued  debt  securities  and  is  a  borrower  under  credit  facilities,  all  of  which  contain
covenants  that  restrict  the  respective  borrower’s  ability  to  engage  in  certain  transactions,  require  them  to  satisfy  certain  financial  covenants  and  impose  certain
operating  and  financial  restrictions  on  them  and  their  respective  subsidiaries.  These  restrictions  include,  among  other  things,  limitations  on  their  ability  to  pay
dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or
sell assets.

We  are  required  to  pay  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flows  as  rent,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and  growth
initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes. As of December 31, 2021 we are required to make annual
rent payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require  us to spend a certain  amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties.  In addition, the leases
governing the Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, Aria (including Vdara) real estate assets require us to comply with certain financial covenants
which, if not met, will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to 1 year of rent under the MGM
Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease and the Aria lease and 2 years of rent under the Bellagio lease. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure
obligations,  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations,  raise  capital,  make  acquisitions,  make  investments,  service  our  debt  and  otherwise  respond  to  competitive  and
economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;
•
•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;

18

•
•
•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and
cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions

The VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,
including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not
be realized at all. Each of the VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, which may not
be satisfied within the anticipated timeframe or at all. For example, completion of the transactions remains subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.
There can be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained, and the regulatory authorities from which approvals are required may impose
conditions  on  the  consummation  of  the  transaction  or  require  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  transaction  or  agreements  to  be  entered  into  in  connection  with  the
transaction.  Such  conditions  or  changes  and  the  process  of  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  could  have  the  effect  of  delaying  or  impeding  the  completion  of  the
transactions,  which  might  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  to  us  of  the  transaction  or  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.  The  completion  of  the  VICI  Transaction  is  also  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  additional  closing  conditions,  including,  among  others,  (i)  receipt  of
approval of VICI’s shareholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021), (ii) the absence of any restraining order, injunction or other judgment, order or decree
from any applicable governmental authority prohibiting the consummation of the transaction, (iii) the effectiveness of the registration statement for VICI’s shares
to be issued in the VICI Transaction and the authorization for listing of those shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect
on the parties to the master transaction agreement, (v) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the master transaction agreement, subject to
customary  materiality  standards,  and  (vi)  compliance  of  each  party  with  its  respective  covenants  under  the  master  transaction  agreement.  No  assurance  can  be
given  that  these  or  any  other  required  conditions  to  closing  will  be  satisfied.  If  the  conditions  precedent  to  the  VICI  Transaction  are  not  satisfied,  the  VICI
Transaction will not be completed unless such conditions are validly waived. Such conditions may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction or may
reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

If any of the transactions are not completed, or are not completed on a timely basis, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the

benefits of having completed such transactions, we may be subject to additional risks, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, the following:

•

•

•

•

•
•

we  will  be  required  to  pay  our  costs  relating  to  such  transactions,  such  as  legal,  accounting,  financial  advisory  and  printing  fees,  whether  or  not  the
transactions are completed;
the diversion of time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing
other beneficial opportunities;
we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities as a result of the failure to consummate
any or all of the transactions;
the price of our shares may decline to the extent that the current market price of our shares reflects a higher price than it otherwise would have based on
the assumption that any or all of the transactions will be consummated;
we would have incurred significant expenses relating to such transactions that we may be unable to recover, including termination fees if applicable; and
we  may  be  subject  to  litigation  related  to  the  failure  to  consummate  the  transactions  or  to  perform  our  obligations  under  the  respective  transaction
agreements.

In addition, we entered into the transactions as part of our current growth strategy. Even if the transactions are completed as currently anticipated, there can
be no assurances that any anticipated benefits from the transactions will be realized as expected or that such benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time
frame or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our
earnings per share, decrease or delay any accretive effect of such transactions and negatively impact the price of our common stock.

The potential litigation instituted against us, our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the proposed VICI Transaction may
prevent  such  transaction  from  becoming  effective  within  the  expected  timeframe  or  at  all.  Potential  litigation  related  to  the  VICI  Transaction  may  result  in
injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the VICI Transaction. One of the conditions to the

19

VICI Transaction under the master transaction agreement is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or
decree issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting consummation of the VICI Transaction or any other transactions contemplated
by the master transaction agreement shall be in effect. Accordingly, any such injunctive or other relief may prevent the VICI Transaction from becoming effective
within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition, defending against such claims may be expensive and divert management’s attention and resources, which could
adversely affect our business and the businesses of the counterparties to such transactions.

Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions

The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last
for an unknown period of time. As of the date of this annual report, there continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its impact
on  U.S.  and  global  economic  activity  and  consumer  behavior.  The  omicron  variant  of  COVID-19,  which  appears  to  be  the  most  transmissible  and  contagious
variant  to  date,  has  caused  an  increase  in  COVID-19  cases  globally.  The  impact  of  the  omicron  variant,  or  of  any  other  variants  that  may  emerge,  cannot  be
predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including the availability of vaccines in different parts of the world, vaccination rates among the
population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the variants, and the response by governmental bodies to reinstate mandated business closures, orders
to “shelter in place,” occupancy limitations, and travel and transportation restrictions. While restrictions have eased throughout 2021, new restrictions to combat
the spread of the variants, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work
facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-
downs may be put into place in the future. In addition, the spread of new variants, including omicron, has had a material impact on domestic and international
travel, which has resulted in reduced demand for hotel rooms, convention space and other casino resorts amenities.

In Macau, while all of our properties were open during 2021, several travel and entry restrictions were in place in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China
(including  the  temporary  suspension  of  ferry  services  between  Hong  Kong  and  Macau,  the  nucleic  acid  test  result  certificate  and  mandatory  quarantine
requirements  for  returning  residents,  for  visitors  from  Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  and  certain  regions  in  mainland  China,  and  bans  on  entry  on  other  visitors)  which
significantly impacted visitation to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. In addition, from time to time during 2021 local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau.
Upon  such  occurrences,  a  state  of  immediate  prevention  was  declared  and  mass  mandatory  nucleic  acid  testing  was  imposed  in  Macau,  the  validity  period  of
negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in
some instances certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these
states  of  immediate  prevention,  such  measures  have  had  a  negative  effect  on  MGM  Grand  Paradise's  operations  and  it  is  uncertain  whether  further  closures,
including the closure of MGM Grand Paradise's properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial results, including the
duration  and  magnitude  of  such  effects,  will  depend  on  numerous  evolving  factors  that  we  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict  or  assess,  including,  but  not
limited  to:  the  duration  and  scope  of  the  pandemic  (and  whether  there  is  a,  or  multiple,  further  resurgences  in  the  future);  the  efficacy  of  the  vaccine  against
existing and new variants of the COVID-19 virus; the adoption rate of vaccines and the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute vaccines domestically and
internationally to allow travel to resume to pre-pandemic levels; the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity,
including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand
for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted; our and our business partners'
ability to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic (including the rise
of variant strains of the virus), such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino and entertainment (including sporting events) activities,
including  the  complete  or  partial  closures  of  our  properties;  and  how  quickly  economies,  travel  activity,  and  demand  for  gaming,  entertainment  and  leisure
activities recovers after the pandemic subsides. We may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental
enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other
risks described  in this section or in any other filings with the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict  the ultimate  scope, duration and impact  the
COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but it may continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of
operations (including revenues and profitability) and stock price.

We  face  significant  competition  with  respect  to  destination  travel  locations  generally  and  with  respect  to  our  peers  in  the  industries  in  which  we
compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our
business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations  and cash  flows. The  hotel,  resort,  entertainment,  and  gaming  industries  are  highly  competitive.  We  do not
believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as well as
the increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity
is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel
room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in
which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our
operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. For instance, local referendums were recently passed to allow retail gaming in Virginia and Nebraska, with active lobbying
occurring in additional states. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we
also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from
owners. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms
and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.

We have also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions
will likely legalize iGaming and online sports betting in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market through our venture,
BetMGM, which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. If BetMGM is unable to
sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may not
receive the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, the expansion of iGaming, online sports betting, and other types of gaming may further compete
with our land-based operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.

In  addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  are  enacted,  including  the  addition  of  new
gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located
elsewhere in or near Asia, certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino
gaming (or iGaming) in the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to
operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if
current  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires  open  additional  facilities,  we  would  face  increased  competition.  Similarly,  as  a  result  of  Macau’s  Gaming
Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau increasing scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in Macau,
suspended our primary gaming promoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters. As a result, we expect competition for the
mass market segment amongst Macau operators will grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenue
previously obtained through use of gaming promoters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Most  jurisdictions  where  casino  gaming  is  currently  permitted  place  numerical  and/or  geographical  limitations  on  the  issuance  of  new  gaming  licenses.
Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming
operations may be restricted  to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive  new opportunities (which may include
acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise.

In addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate.
Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.
Our  business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and  business
development. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or
weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we
offer. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable
job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other

21

acts of violence.  Consumer preferences  also evolve over  time  due to a variety  of factors,  including  demographic  changes, which, for instance,  have  resulted  in
recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate  the preferences  of consumers and timely
react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas may be
affected  by  economic  conditions  in  the  Far  East,  and  all  of  our  Nevada  resorts  are  affected  by  economic  conditions  in  the  United  States,  and  California  in
particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition, including inflationary pressures, affecting consumers, corporations, or the
supply chain, generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, our business has also been impacted by labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions. If we are unable to hire and retain sufficient employees
to operate our properties or procure necessary supplies, our business, results of operations and reputation could be negatively impacted.

In addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties)
from mainland China, general economic, regulatory, geopolitical and market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic
growth  or  changes  to  China’s  current  restrictions  on  travel  and  currency  conversion  or  movements,  including  continued  market  impacts  from  the  COVID-19
outbreak and market impacts resulting from China’s anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-
border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas and facial recognition
technology  on  ATM  machines  in  Macau  to  strictly  enforce  the  "know  your  customer"  regulations  for  mainland  Chinese  bank  cardholders),  could  disrupt  the
number of visitors from mainland China and/or the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue
to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented
may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.

Furthermore, our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. We compete
with  a  large  number  of  casino  resorts  for  a  limited  number  of  employees  and  we  anticipate  that  such  competition  will  grow  in  light  of  the  opening  of  new
developments in Macau. While we seek employees from outside of Macau to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau government policies limit our ability to
import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future
government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase (including limitations on our ability to import labor as a
result of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts). Finally, because additional casino projects have commenced operations
and  other  projects  are  under  construction,  the  existing  transportation  infrastructure  may  need  to  be  expanded  to  accommodate  increased  visitation  to  Macau.  If
transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of
Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be negatively impacted.

We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan. As part of our
MGM 2020 Plan, we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to
successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all, that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits of
these or any other cost savings initiatives, or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings. If we fail to achieve
the anticipated benefits of any current or future cost savings initiatives, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding
company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic we
significantly reduced our historic dividend rate. Although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock; our board of directors
may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends
is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving
cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries ability to generate
the  cash  flow  necessary  to  maintain  quarterly  dividend  payments  on  our  common  stock  is  subject  to  their  operating  results,  cash  requirements  and  financial
condition. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds
available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any
limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our

22

corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various
limitations  and  restrictions,  future  dividend  payments  may  be  further  reduced  or  eliminated  in  their  entirety.  Any  change  in  the  level  of  our  dividends  or  the
suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

All of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination,
lease  extensions,  charges  and  our  relationship  with  the  lessor,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  position  or  results  of
operations. All of our domestic properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance
required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties
(other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties
and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in
exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other
costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in
leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation. Finally, our leases limit our ability to cease operations at our
properties, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Paul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management,
may  have  actual  or  potential  conflicts  of  interest  because  of  their  positions  at  MGP. Paul  Salem  serves  as  our  Chairman  and  as  the  Chairman  of  MGP.  In
addition, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of MGP, and Corey Sanders and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, are also
directors of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that
reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless
create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP’s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potential
acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with
the  resolution  of  any  dispute  between  us  and  MGP  (or  its  subsidiaries)  regarding  the  terms  of  the  agreements  governing  the  separation  and  the  relationship,
between us and MGP, such as under the master lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adverse
arrangements with each other in the future.

Despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has
adopted  a  policy  under  which  certain  transactions  with  us,  including  transactions  involving  consideration  in  excess  of  $25  million,  must  be  approved  in
accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives. We own the single outstanding
Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to
receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares so
long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP
and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over MGP’s affairs, including control over the
outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval. MGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest
exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand,
any resolution or course of action by MGP’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP
if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such
independence  determined  in accordance  with the NYSE’s listing  standards, the standards  established  by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee  of a
board  of  directors  and  certain  additional  independence  requirements  in  our  operating  agreement),  (ii)  determined  by  MGP’s  board  of  directors  to  be  fair  and
reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding
voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). Furthermore, MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate,
over $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand
(any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements
entered into on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii)
such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting
shares owned by us and our affiliates). As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could
have significant benefit to us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be

23

obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and
strategic objectives.

Because  a  significant  number  of  our  major  gaming  resorts  are  concentrated  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip,  we  are  subject  to  greater  risks  than  a  gaming
company that is more geographically diversified. Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may
be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that
disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely
on  air  traffic  for  a  significant  portion  of  our  visitors.  Reductions  in  flights  by  major  airlines  as  a  result  of  higher  fuel  prices  or  lower  demand,  as  a  result  of
limitations on travel imposed to address the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal
interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other
traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. We conduct a portion of our gaming activities
on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and
high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming,
and  variances  in  win-loss  results  attributable  to  high-end  gaming  may  have  a  significant  positive  or  negative  impact  on  cash  flow  and  earnings  in  a  particular
quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  We  issue  markers  to  those  customers  whose  level  of  play  and  financial  resources  warrant,  in  the  opinion  of
management, an extension of credit. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

While gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on
gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of
gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may
be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent
MGM  China  gaming  customers  are  from  other  jurisdictions,  MGM  China  may  not  have  access  to  a  forum  in  which  it  will  be  able  to  collect  all  of  its  gaming
receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse to
enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our

operating results.

We may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits. We review
our  goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-lived  assets  on  an  annual  basis  and  during  interim  reporting  periods  in  accordance  with  the  authoritative  guidance.
Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs
and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future
periods.  If  we  are  required  to  record  additional  impairment  charges  or  write-downs,  this  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  consolidated  results  of
operations.

Leisure  and  business  travel, especially  travel  by  air , are  particularly  susceptible  to  global  geopolitical  events , such  as  terrorist  attacks,  other  acts  of
violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases. We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our
customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or
perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the outbreak of
infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, has severely disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, domestic and international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on
various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of
gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses,

24

cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. Even when those restrictions are removed,
consumer willingness to attend large scale conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing. See
“—The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an
unknown period of time.”

Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against physical loss or

business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing  in  properties  or  businesses,  including  our  investment  in  BetMGM,  decreases  our  ability  to  manage  risk.  In  addition  to  acquiring  or
developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,
in properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such
properties or businesses is subject to inherent  risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material  matters.  In addition,
investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its
obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to
our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned by
such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding on
the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

For example, we share control of BetMGM with Entain with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members.
Disagreements  between  us  and  Entain  could  arise  in  the  future,  including  with  respect  to  the  amount  and  timing  of  capital  contributions.  If  we  and  Entain  are
unable to support the future funding of BetMGM, then BetMGM may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies,
including funding efforts to increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, if we are
awarded a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in Japan, we would do so in a consortium with ORIX and other local investors. As a result, we could
be subject to additional risks related to being unable to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion, which may impact our
ability to complete the project on our anticipated timeline, or at all, or within the agreed upon specifications.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a

material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.

Although  our  business  model  is  primarily  asset-light,  we  intend  to  continue  to  evaluate  opportunities  for  future  construction,  development  or  expansion
projects. Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects, such as our proposed integrated resort in Japan, will be subject to a number of risks,
including:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
changes to plans and specifications;
engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor;
pricing inflation, including wage inflation, in key supply markets;
delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation  and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate
development or construction projects;
labor disputes or work stoppages;
availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;
disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
personal injuries to workers and other persons;
environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
weather interferences or delays;
fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion

or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects

25

which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain
specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a
casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties,

including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase
and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future. Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties,
which  covers  damage  caused  by  a  casualty  loss  (such  as  fire,  natural  disasters,  or  terrorism  or  other  acts  of  violence),  each  policy  has  certain  exclusions.  In
addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a
total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as
labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence,
loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be
covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by
third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to
cover  all  losses  in  any  such  event.  Furthermore,  the  leases  we  entered  into  in  connection  with  the  MGP  BREIT  Venture  Transaction  and  the  Bellagio  sale-
leaseback transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of
insurance coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, then
we  would need  to  obtain  amendments  to  the  leases  or  face  a  default  by  the  applicable  tenant  under  the  lease,  which  could  have  material  adverse  effect  on  our
business.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further

increase our deductibles or self-insured retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business. The development
of  intellectual  property  is  part  of  our  overall  business  strategy,  and  we  regard  our  intellectual  property  to  be  an  important  element  of  our  success.  While  our
business as a whole is not substantially  dependent on any one trademark  or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual  property, we seek to
establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.  We  file  applications  for,  and  obtain  trademarks  in,  the
United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may
infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an
extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  our  intellectual  property  is  difficult.  Litigation  may  be  necessary  to  enforce  our
intellectual  property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate
to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market
acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect
our  business  and  results  of  operations.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  approximately  35,000  of  our  employees  are  covered  by  collective  bargaining  agreements.  A
prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have
an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer
demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our
results  of  operations.  To  the  extent  that  our  non-union  employees  seek  union  representation  or  elect  union  representation,  we  would  have  exposure  to  risks
associated  with  representation  proceedings,  labor  negotiations  and/or  economic  impacts  of  newly  negotiated  labor  agreements.  Furthermore,  we  may  have,  or
acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,”

26

“seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance, Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund, which has been
listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding
improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions)
and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in
the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors
at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.

Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results. We are a large consumer of electricity
and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a
negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts
and a reduction in our revenues.

We may seek to expand through investments  in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest
some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in
other businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions and
investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:

•
•
•
•
•
•

spending cash and incurring debt;
assuming contingent liabilities;
unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
retaining key employees; and
consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, even if
we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our
acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations. Our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions
could materially change, including as a result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions.
In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs,
competitive responses, loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansion of our operations in general,
whether through acquisition, development or internal growth, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees.

In  addition,  we  periodically  review  our  business  to  identify  properties  or  other  assets  that  we  believe  either  are  non-core,  no  longer  complement  our
business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell
these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

The failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to
fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data. We collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for
various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations
enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be
inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and
regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known
as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant
penalties for non-compliance. California has enacted a comprehensive privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect
on January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States. In addition, new privacy requirements in California, Colorado,
and Virginia generally go into effect on January 1, 2023.

Compliance  with  applicable  privacy  laws  and  regulations  may  increase  our  operating  costs  and/or  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  market  our  products,

properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable

27

privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure,
unapproved  dissemination  or  a  breach  of  security  on  systems  storing  our  data  may  result  in  damage  to  our  reputation  and/or  subject  us  to  fines,  payment  of
damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security
for  processing  of  customer  and  employee  information,  such  as  payment  card  and  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information.  Our  data  security  measures  are
reviewed  and  evaluated  regularly;  however,  they  might  not  protect  us  against  increasingly  sophisticated  and  aggressive  threats  including,  but  not  limited  to,
computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from
a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient.

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of
our  computer  systems,  through  cyber-attacks  or  otherwise,  could  impact  our  ability  to  service  our  customers  and  adversely  affect  our  sales  and  the  results  of
operations.  For  instance,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  criminal  cyber  security  attacks  against  companies  where  customer  and  company  information  has  been
compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, have
been  subject  to  cyber  security  breaches  in  the  past  and  may  be  subject  to  cyber  security  breaches  in  the  future.  In  addition,  our  third-party  information  system
service  providers  face  risks  relating  to  cyber  security  similar  to  ours,  and  we  do  not  directly  control  any  of  such  parties’  information  security  operations.  A
significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our
reputation,  cause  a  material  disruption  to  our  operations,  and  result  in  remediation  expenses,  regulatory  penalties  and  litigation  by  customers  and  other  parties
whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We  are  subject  to  risks  related  to  corporate  social  responsibility  and  reputation.  Many  factors  influence  our  reputation  and  the  value  of  our  brands
including  the  perception  held  by  our  customers,  business  partners,  other  key  stakeholders  and  the  communities  in  which  we  do  business.  Our  business  faces
increasing  scrutiny  related  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  factors  and  risk  of  damage  to  our  reputation  and  the  value  of  our  brands  if  we  fail  to  act
responsibly  in  several  areas  including  diversity  and  inclusion,  community  engagement  and  philanthropy,  environmental  sustainability,  plastic  pollution,  climate
change, responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. Any harm to our
reputation could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to risks and costs related to climate change. Extreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, may cause property
damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme
weather  conditions,  including,  but not limited  to, hurricanes,  floods, tornados, wildfires,  and winter storms  in the United States  and severe  typhoons in Macau.
Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers
who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of
water stress or shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies
could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such
coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you
that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions.

Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt or
impede  access  to  our  affected  properties,  and  may  cause  visits  to  our  affected  properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period.  Additionally,  many  states  and
municipalities  have  begun  to  adopt  laws  and  policies  on  climate  change  and  emission  reduction  targets.  Changes  in  federal,  state,  and  local  legislation  and
regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties to
ensure  compliance  with  any  new  or  updated  regulations,  which  may  potentially  adversely  affect  our  operations.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  potential
impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy

Our  businesses  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  and  the  cost  of  compliance  or  failure  to  comply  with  such  regulations  may  adversely  affect  our
business and results of operations. Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in
which we operate.  These laws, regulations  and ordinances  vary from jurisdiction  to jurisdiction,  but generally  concern the responsibility,  financial  stability  and
character  of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gaming  operations.  As  such,  our  gaming
regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that
jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could
have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future
and  any  such  change  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  Furthermore,  our  iGaming  and  online  sports  betting  initiatives  may  be
particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry. For
example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of
wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (“Wire Act”). The DOJ’s updated opinion
concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-
sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and
vacated DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In January 2021, the Court of
Appeals essentially affirmed the decision of the district court, and the DOJ did not file a further appeal. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect
our business, see “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Further,  our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatory
authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the
investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations
of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowings
under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.

Macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future
render  an  interpretation  of  these  laws  and  regulations,  or  issue  new  or  modified  regulations,  that  differ  from  MGM  China’s  interpretation,  which  could  have  a
material  adverse  effect  on  its  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise's  activities  in  Macau  are  subject  to
administrative  review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  able  to  obtain  all  necessary
approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect
to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These
laws  and  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  environmental  matters,  smoking,  employees,
currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  and  marketing  and  advertising.  For  instance,  we  are  subject  to  certain  federal,  state  and  local
environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Energy Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Renewable Portfolio Standards, the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990, and many others. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable
for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or
operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in
the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in Macau, including MGM Macau and MGM
Cotai, is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation
in  other  jurisdictions  and  referendums  in  the  future  cannot  be  predicted,  though  any  smoking  ban  would  be  expected  to  negatively  impact  our  financial
performance.

We  also  deal  with  significant  amounts  of  cash  in  our  operations  and  are  subject  to  recordkeeping  and  reporting  obligations  as  required  by  various  anti-
money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly
known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions in excess of
$10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency

29

transaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve
funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under the
Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy
Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and
regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have
an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on
various activities or other actions to combat its spread. See “—The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results
and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.” In addition to the pandemic-related restrictions that resulted in the temporary
closures  of  our  properties  during  2020,  governmental  or  other  COVID-19-related  restrictions  have  been  extended  or  reimposed  from  time-to-time  and  new
restrictions may be imposed in the future.

Any  violation  of  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  or  any  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  us.  Historically,  a
significant portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in
doing  cross-border  business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.  We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  Corrupt
Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to
foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot
be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate
ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the
SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely
affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected. State and
local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities.  From time to time, legislators and
government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or
uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming or other taxes, the imposition of new taxes or changes to
tax laws that result in increased  taxes to us. If the jurisdictions  in which we operate  were to increase  taxes, impose new taxes or change existing tax laws, our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The  future  recognition  of  our  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset  is  uncertain,  and  the  amount  of  valuation  allowance  we  may  apply  against  such
deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods. We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that
are available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the
extent of 50 percent of U.S. taxable income per year. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the
extent  that  we  determine  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  such  asset  will  be  recovered.  This  evaluation  is  based  on  all  available  evidence,  including  assumptions
concerning  future  U.S.  operating  profits  and  foreign  source  income.  As  a  result,  significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  possible  need  for  a  valuation
allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income
taxes in the period including such change.

We face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us. Claims have been brought against us and our
subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our
current  or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and reputation. Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Risks Related to Our Macau Operations

We have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM
China. As a result of the extension of the Macau gaming subconcession, we entered into a First Renewed Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM China
and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms.

30

Ho”), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and
Taiwan,  other  than  through  MGM  China.  While  gaming  is  currently  prohibited  in  China,  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan,  if  it  is  legalized  in  the  future  our  ability  to
compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
Limited or (ii) the last day of MGM Grand Paradise's subconcession for operation of casino games (or any extension thereof); or (iii) the date when our ownership
of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.

The  Macau  government  can  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating  MGM  Grand
Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022,
or MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which
would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, financial  condition , results  of  operations  and  cash  flows . The  Macau  government  has  the  right  to
unilaterally  terminate  the  subconcession  in  the  event  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand
Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental
obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination,  all of MGM Grand Paradise’s
casino area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise,
and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the
subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.

Furthermore,  under the  subconcession  contract,  MGM Grand Paradise  is obligated  to  comply  with  any laws  and  regulations  that  the Macau  government
might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and
regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand Paradise and the
Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise
will  be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.  During  any  consultation  or  negotiation,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be
obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the
Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the
subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20
years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January
14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft
amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will
be  awarded  for  a  term  to  be  specified  in  the  concession  contract  that  may  not  exceed  10  years  and  which  may  be  extended  by  three  years,  under  certain
circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public
tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place
before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions, which is on June 26, 2022, but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the
existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession
is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will
automatically  be  transferred  to  the  Macau  Government  upon  expiration,  and  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  such  gaming
operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in
Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole,
may  result  in  a  special  put  option  triggering  event  under  MGM  China’s  senior  notes  and  an  event  of  default  under  MGM  China’s  revolving  credit  facilities.
Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least 1 year prior notice. In the event the Macau
government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity
will  be  determined  based  on  the  amount  of  gaming  and  non-gaming  revenue  generated  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  excluding  the  convention  and  exhibition
facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years
before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the subconcession contract or be
awarded a new gaming concession on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. In

31

addition, there is uncertainty on the terms associated with any extension, which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have an
adverse  impact  on  the  financial  position  of  MGM Grand  Paradise.  We  also  cannot  assure  you  that  if  the  subconcession  is  redeemed,  the  compensation  paid  to
MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.

We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are
inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or any
future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
changes in non-United States government programs;
possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-
bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;
different labor regulations;
changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
outbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic;
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are
also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to
the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries
will decrease.

Conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM Grand
Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011,
MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM
China  may  have  conflicting  fiduciary  obligations  to  our  stockholders  and  to  the  minority  stockholders  of  MGM  China.  Decisions  that  could  have  different
implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise
to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

Common Stock Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “MGM.”

There were approximately 3,294 record holders of our common stock as of February 23, 2022.

Dividend Policy

The Company implemented a dividend program in February 2017 pursuant to which it has paid regular quarterly dividends. In the second quarter of 2020
the Company reduced its annual dividend to $0.01 per share in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations at that time. The Company has
maintained an annual dividend of $0.01 per share throughout 2021. The amount, declaration and payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion
of our Board of Directors who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described
below. In addition, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of cash from our operating
subsidiaries  to  generate  the  funds  from  operations  necessary  to  pay  dividends  on  our  common  stock.  Furthermore,  our  senior  credit  facility  contains  financial
covenants and restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Operating Partnership and MGM
China  credit  facilities  each  contain  limitations  on  the  ability  of  the  applicable  subsidiary  under  each  credit  agreement  to  pay  dividends  to  us.  There  can  be  no
assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.

In February 2020, upon substantial completion of the May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $3.0
billion stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the
Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion
of  management,  dependent  on  market  conditions,  applicable  securities  laws,  and  other  factors,  and  may  be  suspended  or  discontinued  at  any  time.  All  shares
repurchased  by  the  Company  during  the  quarter  ended  December  31,  2021  were  purchased  pursuant  to  the  Company’s  publicly  announced  stock  repurchase
programs and have been retired.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31,
2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to
December  31,  2019  can  be  found  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) on February 26, 2021.

Description of our business and key performance indicators

Our primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We
operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is
cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate
operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders.
We  make  significant  investments  in  our  resorts  through  newly  remodeled  hotel  rooms,  restaurants,  entertainment  and  nightlife  offerings,  as  well  as  other  new
features and amenities.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue
to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of
major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play
during  major  holidays,  including  New  Year  and  Lunar  New  Year.  While  our  results  do  not  depend  on  key  individual  customers,  a  significant  portion  of  our
operating  income  is  generated  from  high-end  gaming  customers,  which  can  cause  variability  in  our  results.  In  addition,  our  success  in  marketing  to  customer
groups  such  as  convention  customers  and  the  financial  health  of  customer  segments  such  as  business  travelers  or  high-end  gaming  customers  from  a  specific
country or region can affect our results.

Financial Impact of COVID-19

The spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties were
temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of
our properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of our properties or portions
thereof into the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations,
with  restrictions  varying  by  jurisdiction.  Beginning  in  the  latter  part  of  the  first  quarter  of  2021  and  continuing  into  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  our  domestic
jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.

Although  all  of  our  properties  have  re-opened,  in  light  of  the  unpredictable  nature  of  the  pandemic,  including  the  emergence  and  spread  of  COVID-19
variants, the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, we cannot predict
whether jurisdictions, states or the federal government will adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future than in the past, including stay-at-home orders
or the temporary closure of all or a portion of our properties as a result of the pandemic.

In  Macau,  following  a  temporary  closure  of  our  properties  on  February  5,  2020,  operations  resumed  on  February  20,  2020,  subject  to  certain  health
safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars,
temperature  checks,  and  mask  protection.  Although  the  issuance  of  tourist  visas  (including  the  individual  visit  scheme)  for  residents  of  Zhuhai,  Guangdong
Province  and  all  other  provinces  in  mainland  China  to  travel  to  Macau  resumed  on  August  12,  2020,  August  26,  2020  and  September  23,  2020,  respectively,
several  travel  and  entry  restrictions  in  Macau,  Hong  Kong  and  mainland  China  remain  in  place  (including  the  temporary  suspension  of  ferry  services  between
Hong  Kong  and  Macau,  the  negative  nucleic  acid  test  result  certificate,  and  mandatory  quarantine  requirements  for  returning  residents,  for  visitors  from  Hong
Kong, Taiwan, and

37

mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors), which significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local
COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was
imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain
events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances, certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel
operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on our operations and it is uncertain whether
further closures, including the closure of our properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.

The Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Las Vegas
visitor volume increased 69% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The Las
Vegas market has had the addition of new sporting events and venues, the expansion of convention centers, as well as music and entertainment events, which have
positively impacted visitation, along with the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions, as discussed above.

The MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Macau
visitor arrivals increased 31% compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, as
the prior year period was more negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year period.

For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and

Market Conditions.”

Other Developments

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  lease  the  real  estate  assets  of  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York,  Park  MGM,  Excalibur,  The  Park,  Gold  Strike
Tunica,  MGM Grand  Detroit,  Beau  Rivage,  Borgata,  Empire  City,  MGM  National  Harbor,  MGM  Northfield  Park,  and  MGM Springfield  pursuant  to  a  master
lease  agreement  with  MGP.  See  Note  1  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  information  regarding  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,
which we consolidate in our financial statements. All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease with MGP, have been eliminated in
consolidation.

As further discussed below, we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement with Bellagio BREIT Venture, the real estate assets of
Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement with MGP BREIT Venture, and the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant
to a lease agreement with a fund managed by Blackstone, as further discussed below.

In April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owned the
real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, from MGP and MGP retained the real estate assets. We then rebranded the property to
MGM Northfield Park, and added it to the master lease between us and MGP. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this
acquisition.

Also, in January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City in Yonkers, New York for consideration of approximately
$865  million.  Subsequently,  MGP  acquired  the  developed  real  property  associated  with  Empire  City  from  us  and  Empire  City  was  added  to  the  master  lease
between us and MGP. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped
land adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future. See Note 4 and
Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.

In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding
of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction with MGP, which is
eliminated in consolidation.

In November 2019, we completed the Bellagio transaction, pursuant to which Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate
assets from us and entered into a lease agreement to lease the real estate assets back to us. The Bellagio lease has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year
renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual rent of $245 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 10
years

38

and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4%
thereafter. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the property on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain
financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount
equal to rent for the succeeding 2-year period. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, we received total consideration of $4.25 billion, which
consisted  of  a  5%  equity  interest  in  the  venture  and  cash  of  approximately  $4.2  billion.  We  also  provide  a  shortfall  guarantee  of  the  principal  amount  of
indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.7 billion.
See Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall
guarantee, respectively.

In December 2019, we sold Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $663 million paid in cash and a secured note
due 2024 with a face value of $163 million and fair value of $134 million. In connection with our review of the carrying value of assets to be sold due to the offer
for sale received during the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $219 million. Upon completion of the sale in the fourth quarter, we
recorded a loss of $2 million. See Note 1 and Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.

In February 2020, we completed the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay
Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to MGP BREIT Venture, owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In
exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash,
$1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in MGP
BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value of
MGP BREIT Venture. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid
thereon).  On the closing  date, BREIT also purchased  approximately  5 million  MGP Class A shares  for $150 million.  See Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall guarantee, respectively.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and
MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides
for an initial annual rent of $292 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase
during  the  prior  year,  subject  to  a  cap  of  3%.  In  addition,  the  lease  obligates  us  to  spend  a  specified  percentage  of  net  revenues  at  the  properties  on  capital
expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of
credit  in  favor  of  the  landlord  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  rent  for  the  succeeding  1-year  period.  See  Note  11  in  the  accompanying  financial  statements  for
information regarding this lease agreement.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual

cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18.

Also, in January 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right following the
closing  of  the  MGP  BREIT  Venture  Transaction  to  issue  MGP  Class  A  shares,  in  lieu  of  cash,  to  us  in  connection  with  us  exercising  our  right  to  require  the
Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the ten day average closing price prior to the
date of the notice of redemption. The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of
February 14, 2022 or upon our receipt of cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020 the
Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020,
the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a
result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.

In  March  2021,  we  delivered  a  notice  of  redemption  to  MGP  covering  approximately  37  million  Operating  Partnership  units  that  we  held  which  was
satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP's issuance of Class A shares. See
Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.

39

In August 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP. Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders
will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI OP in
exchange for each Operating Partnership unit we hold. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to the
five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the
majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with us retaining an approximate $370 million ownership interest in the VICI OP (based upon
the close price of VICI stock as of August 3, 2021). MGP’s Class B share that we hold will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amended
and restated master lease with VICI. The new master lease will have an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year renewals, and initial annual rent of $860 million,
escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a
cap  of  3%.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  first  half  of  2022,  subject  to  customary  closing  conditions,  regulatory  approvals,  and  approval  by  VICI
stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions — The VICI Transaction,
The Cosmopolitan  transaction,  and  The Mirage  transaction  each  remain  subject  to  the satisfaction  of certain  closing  conditions,  including  the receipt  of certain
regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.”

In  September  2021,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  the  operations  of  The  Cosmopolitan  for  cash  consideration  of  $1.625  billion,  subject  to
customary working capital adjustments. Additionally, we will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan lease
will have an initial term of 30 years with three subsequent 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial
annual cash rent of $200 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during
the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. Additionally, the lease will require us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues over a rolling 5-year period at the
property on capital expenditures and for us to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or one or more
letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 1-year period. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022,
subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

In  September  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  50%  ownership  interest  in  CityCenter  held  by  Infinity  World  for  cash  consideration  of  $2.125
billion. Upon the closing of the transaction, we own 100% of CityCenter and accordingly no longer account for our interest under the equity method of accounting,
and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this
transaction.

In September 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease pursuant to which
we lease back the real property. The lease has an initial term of 30 years with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease
provides for an initial annual rent of $215 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI
increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital
expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide a letter of credit in favor
of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding 1-year period. See Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information
regarding this lease.

In October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between us
and MGP through which we lease back the real property. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in our
consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.

In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion,
subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, Hard Rock is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust
and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing has not occurred on or before December 13, 2022, which date
may be extended by either party to March 13, 2023 under certain circumstances. The agreement contemplates a reverse termination fee of $322.5 million that is
payable by Hard Rock to us in the event that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or gaming regulatory approval. Upon closing, the master lease between us and
VICI  (or  MGP  in  the  event  that  the  VICI  Transaction  is  terminated)  will  be  amended  and  restated  to  reflect  a  $90  million  reduction  in  annual  cash  rent.  The
transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination
of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals.

Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:

•

•

•

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our
normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to
23.0% for non-Baccarat; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and

Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room
(“REVPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied
rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the
mix  of  rooms  provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,  particularly  to  casino  customers,  includes  a  disproportionate  suite  component,  the  composite  ADR
including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service
during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded from the available room count
when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.

Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are:

Gaming  revenue  indicators:  MGM  China  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  of  nonnegotiable  chip  wagers  won  by  MGM  China  calculated  as
nonnegotiable  chips  purchased  plus  nonnegotiable  chips  exchanged  less  nonnegotiable  chips  returned.  Turnover  provides  a  basis  for  measuring  VIP
casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover; however, reduced gaming
volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in MGM China’s hold percentages.

Aria was excluded from the table above, as it was not consolidated during 2020.
Park MGM and Mandalay Bay’s hotel tower operations were closed midweek starting November 9, 2020 and November 30, 2020, respectively, and full week hotel tower operations
resumed on March 3, 2021.
The Mirage’s hotel tower operations were closed midweek beginning November 30, 2020. The entire property was closed midweek starting January 4, 2021, and re-opened on March
3, 2021.
MGM Springfield’s hotel was re-closed beginning November 2, 2020, and partial hotel operations resumed with midweek closures on March 5, 2021. Full hotel operations resumed
on December 13, 2021.
MGM Grand Detroit re-closed on November 17, 2020 and re-opened on December 23, 2020, with the hotel tower operations resuming February 9, 2021.

Consolidated net revenues were $9.7 billion in 2021 compared to $5.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 88%. The current year benefited from the inclusion of
the net revenues of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021 and the removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions at our properties, as well
as  an  increase  in  travel,  while  the  prior  year  was  negatively  affected  by  temporary  property  closures  at  certain  of  our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts  and  Regional
Operations for a portion of the year due to the pandemic. At MGM China, the prior year was negatively affected by both property closures in the first quarter and
was also more significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year. These factors resulted in a 111% increase in net revenues at
our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, a 72% increase in net revenues at our Regional Operations, and an 84% increase in net revenues at MGM China.

Consolidated operating income was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss of $642 million in 2020, due primarily to the
temporary property closures in the prior year as well as the inclusion of the operating income of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021, as discussed
above. The current year included a gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net of $1.6 billion and the prior year included a $1.5 billion gain on REIT transactions, net
and  $26  million  in  restructuring  costs.  In  addition,  corporate  expense  decreased  $37  million  compared  to  the  prior  year.  Corporate  expense  in  the  current  year
included $34 million in transaction costs, while the prior year included $44 million of CEO transition expense and $49 million of October 1 litigation settlement
expense. Included in the CEO transition expense is $20 million of stock compensation expense, of which approximately $13 million related to the modification and
accelerated vesting of outstanding stock compensation awards. Property transactions, net in the current year included a gain of $29 million related to a reduction in
the  estimate  of  contingent  consideration  related  to  the  Empire  City  acquisition,  a  gain  of  $76  million  relating  to  the  sale  of  art,  and  an  other-than-temporary
impairment charge of $22 million related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. Property transactions, net in the prior year included a $64 million other-
than-temporary  non-cash impairment  charge on an equity method investment  and $17 million related  to a loss on production show costs. Depreciation  expense
decreased $60 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of certain assets

42

becoming fully depreciated in the current year at MGM China, primarily at MGM Cotai. General and administrative expense increased $385 million compared to
the  prior  year  due primarily  to the prior  year  reflecting  the temporary  property closures,  the inclusion  of rent  expense  for the Aria lease,  which commenced  in
September  2021,  and  also  due  to  a  full  period  of  rent  expense  for  the  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  and  Mandalay  Bay  lease  in  the  current  year,  partially  offset  by
realized benefits from our cost savings initiatives at our domestic properties.

available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts food and beverage revenue was $1.0 billion in 2021, compared to $472 million in 2020, an increase of 115%, due primarily to the
temporary closures at certain properties and operational and capacity restrictions in the prior year and removal of those restrictions in the current year as well as an
increase in travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021. However, not all outlets
were fully re-opened during the current year and the properties did not benefit from the removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions as well as an
increase in travel primarily until the latter part of the second quarter of the current year.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts entertainment,  retail and other revenue was $770 million in 2021, compared to $383 million in 2020, an increase of 101%, due
primarily to the temporary property closures for a portion of the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions as well as an increase in
travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021. However, venue re-openings and events
did not primarily occur until beginning in the latter part of the second quarter of the current year.

Regional Operations

Regional Operations casino revenue was $2.7 billion in 2021, compared to $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 73%, due primarily to the temporary property

closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions and, to a lesser extent, increase in travel in the current year.

MGM China net revenues were $1.2 billion in 2021, compared to $657 million in 2020, an increase of 84%. The prior year was negatively affected by both

property closures in February 2020 and was more significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year.

Corporate and other

Corporate and other revenue includes revenues from other corporate operations, management services and reimbursed costs revenue primarily related to our
CityCenter  management  agreement  (which  was  terminated  upon  the  acquisition  of  CityCenter  in  September  2021).  Reimbursed  costs  revenue  represents
reimbursement of costs, primarily payroll-related, incurred by us in connection with the provision of management services and was $226 million, $245 million and
$437 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reimbursed costs revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased compared to the prior year due
primarily to the termination of the CityCenter management agreement as discussed above. See below for additional discussion of our share of operating results
from unconsolidated affiliates.

as well as realized benefits from our cost savings initiatives.

Regional Operations

Regional  Operations  Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  was  $1.2  billion  in  2021  compared  to  $344  million  in  2020.  Regional  Operations  Adjusted  Property

as realized benefits from our cost saving initiatives.

MGM China

MGM China’s Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $25 million in 2021 compared to a loss of $194 million in 2020. The increase was due primarily to the
temporary  property  closures  in  the  prior  year  as  well  as  the  prior  year  being  more  significantly  impacted  by  travel  and  entry  restrictions  in  Macau  and  other
operational restrictions related to the pandemic than in the current year. License fee expense was $21 million for 2021 and $11 million in the prior year.

In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity
interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter
in our financial statements.

In June 2021, CityCenter closed the sale of its Harmon land for $80 million on which it recorded a $30 million gain. We recorded a $50 million gain, which

included $15 million of our 50% share of the gain recorded by CityCenter and $35 million representing the reversal of certain basis differences in 2021.

Our share of CityCenter’s operating income, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $128 million for the current year period through September
26,  2021  compared  to  our  share  of  CityCenter's  operating  loss  of  $30  million  in  2020,  due  primarily  to  the  temporary  property  closures  in  the  prior  year  and
removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions, an increase in travel beginning primarily in the second quarter of the current year, and the gain related
to the sale of its Harmon land in the current year, as discussed above, partially offset by a shorter comparative period in the current year given that, as of September
2021, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, as discussed above.

Gross interest expense was $800 million in 2021 compared to $679 million in 2020. The increase in gross interest expense was due primarily to an increase
in average debt outstanding related to senior notes due to the issuances by us, the Operating Partnership and MGM China in 2020 and 2021, partially offset by a
decrease in the weighted average interest rate of the senior notes. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on
long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of
cash.

Other, net. Other income, net was $66 million in 2021 compared to other expense, net of $89 million in 2020. The current year included a $28 million net
gain on change in fair value of an equity instrument, a $39 million gain on the Operating Partnership’s unhedged interest rate swaps, and $22 million of interest
income, partially offset by $13 million of foreign currency remeasurement losses primarily related to MGM China’s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. The
prior year included a $109 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our senior notes and the termination of our revolving facility, as well as
an $18 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to the Operating Partnership’s repayment of its term loan A facility and its term loan B facility,
partially offset by $9 million of foreign currency remeasurement gains primarily related to MGM China’s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes, and $32 million in
interest income.

Our effective rate for 2021 was favorably impacted by the permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on consolidation of CityCenter partially offset by the
unfavorable  impact  of  losses  in  Macau  that  we  could  not  benefit.  The  effective  rate  for  2020  was  unfavorably  impacted  by  losses  in  Macau  that  we  could  not
benefit and adjustments to valuation allowances for Macau deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from carrying back
net operating losses to tax years with a higher tax rate than is currently in effect.

Cash taxes paid increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable income

following the recovery of the business from the impacts of COVID-19.

Reportable Segment GAAP measure

“Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and
underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes,
depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance,
accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense associated
with triple-net operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, property transactions, net, and also
excludes gain on consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of  Harmon  land  recorded  within  income  from  unconsolidated  affiliates  and
corporate expense (which includes CEO transition expense and October 1 litigation settlement) and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each
operating  segment,  and  rent  expense  related  to  the  master  lease  with  MGP  that  eliminates  in  consolidation.  We  manage  capital  allocation,  tax  planning,  stock
compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment
net revenues.

Non-GAAP Measure

“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up
expenses,  property  transactions,  net,  gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net,  gain  on  consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  CEO  transition  expense,  October  1  litigation
settlement,  restructuring  costs  (which  represents  costs  related  to  severance,  accelerated  stock  compensation  expense,  and  consulting  fees  directly  related  to  the
operating  model  component  of  the  MGM  2020  Plan),  rent  expense  associated  with  triple-net  operating  and  ground  leases,  gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of
Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.

Adjusted EBITDAR information is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to
reported  GAAP  measures  because  we  believe  this  measure  is  widely  used  by  analysts,  lenders,  financial  institutions,  and  investors  as  a  principal  basis  for  the
valuation  of  gaming  companies.  We  believe  that  while  items  excluded  from  Adjusted  EBITDAR  may  be  recurring  in  nature  and  should  not  be  disregarded  in
evaluation  of our earnings performance,  it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing  current  results and trends. Also, we believe  excluded items may not
relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when
we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size
and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our
resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in
unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure
of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, because this measure is not

48

presented on a GAAP basis and exclude certain expenses, including the rent expense associated with our triple-net operating and ground leases, and are provided
for the limited purposes discussed herein.

Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to
cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash
flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not
reflected  in  Adjusted  EBITDAR.  Also,  other  companies  in  the  gaming  and  hospitality  industries  that  report  Adjusted  EBITDAR  information  may  calculate
Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material.

As of December 31, 2021, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee
our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGP, the Operating Partnership, MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor,
Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that operates MGM Springfield), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including MGM
China and its subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility
or  any  of  our  future  capital  markets  indebtedness,  that  subsidiary  will  be  released  and  relieved  of  its  obligations  to  guarantee  our  existing  senior  notes.  The
indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor
then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.

49

The guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors,
junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations
of  our  subsidiaries  that  do  not  guarantee  the  senior  notes.  In  addition,  the  obligations  of  each  subsidiary  guarantor  under  its  guarantee  is  limited  so  as  not  to
constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that
effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.

The summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Certain of our guarantor subsidiaries
collectively own Operating Partnership units and each subsidiary accounts for its respective investment under the equity method within the summarized financial
information  presented  below.  These  subsidiaries  have  also  accounted  for  the  MGP  master  lease  as  an  operating  lease,  recording  operating  lease  liabilities  and
operating ROU assets with the related rent expense of guarantor subsidiaries reflected within the summarized financial information.

Cash Flows

Operating activities. Trends in our operating  cash flows tend to follow trends in operating  income, excluding  non-cash charges, but can be affected  by
changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash provided by
operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.5 billion in 2020. The change from the prior year was due primarily
to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR discussed within the results of operations section above, and due to the prior year being negatively affected by a
change in working capital related to gaming and non-gaming deposits, gaming taxes and other gaming liabilities, and payroll related liabilities as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and cash paid for interest and taxes.

Investing activities. Our  investing  cash  flows  can  fluctuate  significantly  from  year  to  year  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capital
investments  in  new  or  existing  resorts,  business  acquisitions  or  dispositions,  and  the  timing  of  maintenance  capital  expenditures  to  maintain  the  quality  of  our
resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public
spaces and hotel rooms.

Cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2021 compared to $2.2 billion in 2020. In 2021, we received $3.9 billion in net cash proceeds from
the sale of the real estate of Aria (including Vdara), received $107 million in net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily related to the sale of
art,  which  were  partially  offset  by  our  payments  of  $1.8  billion  to  acquire  CityCenter,  net  of  cash  acquired,  $491  million in  capital  expenditures,  as  further
discussed below, and contributions of $225 million to BetMGM. In comparison, in the prior year we received $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the Mandalay
Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate transaction, which were partially offset by $271 million in capital expenditures and $80 million in contributions to
BetMGM. In the prior year period, distributions from unconsolidated affiliates included $51 million related to our share of a distribution paid by CityCenter.

Capital Expenditures

In 2021, we made capital expenditures of $491 million, of which $68 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $49
million primarily related to construction of the Emerald Tower project at MGM Cotai and $19 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at
our  Las  Vegas  Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations  and  corporate  entities  of  $423  million  primarily  relate  to  expenditures  in  information  technology  and  room
remodels.

In 2020, we made capital expenditures of $271 million, of which $108 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $95
million primarily related to construction close-out and projects at MGM Cotai and $13 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las
Vegas  Strip  Resorts,  Regional  Operations  and  corporate  entities  of  $162  million  included  expenditures  relating  to  information  technology,  health  and  safety
initiatives, and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.

Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion in 2021 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 billion in 2020. In
2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $324 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased
$1.8 billion of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds received of $793 million from the issuance of MGP's Class A shares. In comparison, in the prior
year period, we received net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion, net
proceeds of $525 million from MGP’s Class A share issuances, net debt borrowings of $1.1 billion, as further discussed below, repurchased $354 million of our
common stock, distributed $286 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and paid $78 million in dividends to our shareholders.

Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt

In 2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, which consisted of the repayment of the $1.7 billion outstanding on CityCenter's credit facility in
full,  which  was  assumed  in  the  acquisition,  using  cash  on  hand,  and  net  repayments  of  $407  million  on  MGM  China’s  first  revolving  credit  facility.  These
repayments were partially offset by MGM China’s March 2021 issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 at an issue
price of 99.97% and net draws of $40 million on the Operating Partnership's revolving credit facility, of which $35 million was used in connection with MGP's
acquisition  of MGM Springfield  with the  remainder  used to fund the  Operating  Partnership's  and MGP's distribution  and dividend  payments.  The net proceeds
from MGM China’s 4.75% senior notes due 2027 issuance were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China first revolving credit facility
and for general corporate purposes.

51

In 2020, we had net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion and net
debt borrowings of $1.1 billion, which consisted of net borrowings on MGM China’s credit facility of $103 million, our issuance of $750 million of 4.75% senior
notes and $750 million of 6.75% senior notes, the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $750 million of 3.875% senior notes and $800 million of 4.625% senior
notes, and MGM China’s issuance of $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, partially offset by the tender of $750 million of our senior notes and the corresponding
$97 million of tender offer costs, and the net repayment of $1.7 billion on the Operating Partnership's senior credit facility consisting of the repayment of $1.3
billion of its term loan B facility in full using the proceeds of the $1.3 billion bridge loan facility, which was then assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, the repayment
of its $399 million term loan A facility in full using the net proceeds from MGP’s settlement of forward equity agreements, partially offset by a net draw of $10
million on its revolving credit facility.

In March 2020, with certain of the proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, we completed cash tender offers for an aggregate amount of $750
million of our senior notes, comprised of $325 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due 2025, $100 million principal amount of our
outstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2026, and $325 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.5% senior notes due 2027.

In  May  2020,  we  issued  $750  million  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.750%  senior  notes  due  2025.  The  proceeds  were  used  to  further  increase  our

liquidity position.

In June 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to
repay borrowings on the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility, which were used to fund the May 2020 redemption of $700 million of Operating Partnership
units held by us.

In June 2020, MGM China issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to partially repay

amounts outstanding under the MGM China credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

In  October  2020,  we  issued  $750  million  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of  4.75%  senior  notes  due  2028.  The  proceeds  were  used  for  general  corporate

purposes.

In November 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. The proceeds were used

for general corporate purposes, which included the December 2020 redemption of $700 million of the Operating Partnership units held by us.

Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners and Share Repurchases

In  2021,  we  repurchased  and  retired  $1.8  billion  of  our  common  stock  pursuant  to  our  May  2018  $2.0  billion  and  February  2020  $3.0  billion  stock
repurchase programs. As a result of those repurchases, we completed our May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, and the remaining availability under the
February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase program was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, we repurchased and retired $354 million of our common
stock pursuant to our May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program.

In March 2021, June 2021, September 2021, and December 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $5 million for 2021. In March 2020, we

paid a dividend of $0.15 per share, and in June 2020, September 2020 and December 2020, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $78 million for 2020.

In 2020, MGM China paid the final dividend for 2019 of $41 million, of which we received $23 million and noncontrolling interests received $18 million.

The Operating Partnership paid the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during 2021 and 2020:

•

•

$545  million  of  distributions  paid  in  2021,  of  which  we  received  $243  million  and  MGP  received  $302  million,  which  MGP  concurrently  paid  as  a
dividend to its Class A shareholders; and
$602  million  of  distributions  paid  in  2020,  of  which  we  received  $358  million  and  MGP  received  $244  million,  which  MGP  concurrently  paid  as  a
dividend to its Class A shareholders.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash

As  previously  discussed,  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  developments  surrounding  the  global  pandemic  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  our  business,
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter. We require a certain
amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts.

52

In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks.
Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay
amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities
subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and
contractual  obligations  in  addition  to  planned  capital  expenditures  and  commitments,  including  acquiring  the  operations  of  The  Cosmopolitan  for  cash
consideration of $1.625 billion, as discussed further in Note 1.

As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which MGM China held $399 million and the Operating Partnership held $8
million. In addition to our cash and cash equivalent balance, we have significant holdings: a 41.5% economic interest in MGP (refer to Note 1 for discussion on our
agreement entered into in August 2021 regarding the VICI Transaction) and an approximate 56% interest in MGM China.

At December 31, 2021, we had $12.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $360 million outstanding under the $1.25 billion MGM China
first revolving credit facility and $50 million outstanding under the $1.35 billion Operating Partnership revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our
$1.675 billion revolving credit facility or the $400 million MGM China second revolving credit facility. We have $1.0 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve
months, which we expect to repay with cash on hand.

Due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its
second revolving credit facility to provide for waivers of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio through the fourth quarter of 2022. In
February  2022,  MGM  China  further  amended  each  of  its  first  revolving  credit  facility  and  its  second  revolving  credit  facility  to  extend  the  financial  covenant
waivers through maturity.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  expected  cash  interest  payments,  excluding  MGP  and  MGM  China,  for  2022,  2023,  and  2024  are  approximately  $300
million,  $225  million,  and  $190  million,  respectively,  and  our  expected  cash  interest  payments  on  a  consolidated  basis,  which  includes  MGP  if  the  VICI
Transaction does not close and MGM China, for 2022, 2023, and 2024, are approximately $715 million, $625 million, and $585 million, respectively. We are also
required as of December 31, 2021 to make annual cash rent payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also
subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance,
utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent.

We have planned capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $775 million to $815 million domestically and approximately $110 million to $130 million
at  MGM  China,  which  is  inclusive  of  the  capital  expenditures  required  under  the  triple-net  lease  agreements,  each  of  which  requires  us  to  spend  a  specified
percentage of net revenues, at the respective properties, on capital expenditures. We additionally have planned contributions to BetMGM in 2022 of approximately
$225 million.

We also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our February 2020 $3.0 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2021,
we  repurchased  approximately  15  million shares  of  our  common  stock  at  an  average  price  of  $43.88 per  share  for  an  aggregate  amount  of  $670  million.
Repurchased shares were retired.

In January 2022, the Operating Partnership paid $141 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $59 million and MGP

received $82 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.

On February  9,  2022,  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  quarterly  dividend  of  $0.0025 per  share.  The  dividend  will  be  payable  on  March  15,  2022 to
holders of record on March 10, 2022. Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of
directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may
deem relevant.

As previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant economic disruption both globally and in the United
States, and impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and
thereafter. As widespread vaccine distribution continues and operational restrictions have been removed, we have seen economic recovery in some of the market
segments  in  which  we  operate,  as  shown  in  our  Summary  Operating  Results.  However,  some  areas  continue  to  experience  renewed  outbreaks  and  surges  in
infection rates. As a result, our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to reversal of these trends or other
continuing negative effects caused by

53

the pandemic. We cannot predict the degree, or duration, to which our operations will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects could be material.
We continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities
and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to further
adjust our operating plan, including the implementation or extension of new or existing restrictions, which may include the reinstatement of stay-at-home orders in
the jurisdictions in which we operate or additional restrictions on travel and/or our business operations. Because the situation is ongoing, and because the duration
and severity remain unclear, it is difficult to forecast any impacts on our future results.

For additional information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in Note 9 and the lease liability maturity table

in Note 11.

Principal Debt Arrangements

See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To
prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  we  must  make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  regularly  evaluate  these  estimates  and  assumptions,
particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and
have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an
inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

Loss Reserve for Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play
to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and,
historically, to gaming promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay
their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including
the  mailing  of  statements  and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.  Markers  are  generally  legally
enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of
foreign  customers  may  be  reached  to  satisfy  judgments  entered  in  the  United  States.  We  consider  the  likelihood  and  difficulty  of  enforceability,  among  other
factors,  when  we  issue  credit  to  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  who  are  not  residents  of  the  United  States.  MGM  China  performs  background  checks  and
investigates  credit  worthiness  prior  to  issuing credit.  Refer  to Note 2  for further  discussion  of our casino  receivables  and those  due from  customers  residing  in
foreign countries.

We maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases
the loss reserve. We regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally
established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by relevant historical analysis and any other known information
such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to
aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount,
based  on  the  age  of  the  account,  the  customer’s  current  and  expected  future  financial  condition,  collection  history  and  current  and  expected  future  economic
conditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial
condition and the collection history of the customer or, historically, the gaming promoter.

In  addition  to  enforceability  issues,  the  collectability  of  unpaid  markers  given  by  foreign  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  is  affected  by  a  number  of
factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances
can  be  significant,  the  loss  reserve  and  the  provision  can  change  significantly  between  periods,  as  information  about  a  certain  customer  becomes  known  or  as
changes in a region’s economy occur.

Approximately $63 million and $54 million of casino receivables and $31 million and $18 million of the loss reserve for casino accounts receivable relate to
MGM China at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to a
decrease in specific reserves at our domestic resorts, as well as the inclusion of Aria in the current year, which had a lower loss reserve compared to our other
domestic resorts due to the age of its outstanding receivables, partially offset by an increase in the loss reserve at MGM China primarily due to an increase in its
specific reserves. At December 31, 2021, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before
income taxes by $4 million.

Fixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  was
therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong
its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When
we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and
construction subsidiaries.  In addition, interest cost associated with major development  and construction projects  is capitalized  as part of the cost of the project.
Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts
when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We  must make  estimates  and  assumptions  when accounting  for capital  expenditures.  Whether  an  expenditure  is  considered  a maintenance  expense,  or  a
capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,
which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful
lives.  We  determine  the  estimated  useful  lives  based  on  our  experience  with  similar  assets,  engineering  studies,  and  our  estimate  of  the  usage  of  the  asset.
Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

We  evaluate  our  property  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  based  on  our  classification  as  held  for  sale  or  to  be  held  and  used.
Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the
asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets
to  be  held  and  used,  we  review  for  impairment  whenever  indicators  of  impairment  exist.  We  then  compare  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  asset,  on  an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted
cash  flows  do  not  exceed  the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typically
measured  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  model  whereby  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  using  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  developed  using  a  standard
capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction
costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the
asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash
flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

55

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.
Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic
factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets
and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential
sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. During 2019, we
recorded a non-cash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment
test  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  license  rights  and
trademarks.  For  our  2021  annual  impairment  tests,  we  utilized  the  option  to  perform  a  qualitative  (“step  zero”)  analysis  for  certain  of  our  indefinite-lived
intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected to
perform a quantitative analysis for the MGM Northfield Park gaming license in 2021 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair value
exceeded  its  carrying  value  by  a  substantial  margin.  As  discussed  below,  management  makes  significant  judgments  and  estimates  as  part  of  these  analyses.  If
certain  future  operating  results  do  not  meet  current  expectations  it  could  cause  carrying  values  of  the  intangibles  to  exceed  their  fair  values  in  future  periods,
potentially resulting in an impairment charge.

We review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment
charges in 2021. For our 2021 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was
more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes
significant  judgments  and  estimates  as  part  of  these  analyses.  If  future  operating  results  of  our  reporting  units  do  not  meet  current  expectations  it  could  cause
carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and
actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  our  estimates.  In  addition,  the  determination  of  multiples,  capitalization  rates  and  the  discount  rates  used  in  the
impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments in
unconsolidated affiliates. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded $22 million and $64 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairment charges on equity
method investments. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid

in foreign jurisdictions are not material.

We  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  related  to  net  operating  losses,  tax  credit  carryforwards  and  temporary  differences  with  future  tax
consequences.  We  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  by  a  valuation  allowance  if  it  is  more  likely  than  not  such  assets  will  not  be  realized.
Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such "more-likely-than-not" realization
threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.

We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a
valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $149 million and $156 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
We reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to

56

realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other
comprehensive  income  in  the  period  in  which  we  make  such  a  determination.  Likewise,  if  we  later  determine  that  we  are  more  likely  than  not  to  realize  the
deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we
must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Furthermore, we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are
fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly,
our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these
potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could
be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision,
net income and cash flows.

Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising
from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk
associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings
and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the Operating
Partnership’s credit facility. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As
fixed-rate  debt  matures,  however,  and  if  additional  debt  is  acquired  to  fund  the  debt  repayment,  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  may  be  affected  by  changes  in
interest  rates.  This  effect  would  be  realized  in  the  periods  subsequent  to  the  periods  when  the  debt  matures.  We  do  not  hold  or  issue  financial  instruments  for
trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

As of December 31, 2021, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 3% of our total borrowings after giving effect on the Operating Partnership’s
borrowings for the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average of 1.783% on a total notional
amount of $700 million. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has $900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective. The
following  table  provides  additional  information  about  the  maturities  of  our  debt  subject  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  excluding  the  effect  of  the  Operating
Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
mainly  related  to  MGM  China  and  to  our  operations  at  MGM  Macau  and  MGM  Cotai.  While  recent  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  have  not  been  significant,
potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these
exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will
remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar
denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on
our financial position and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to
the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of MGM Resorts International

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2022,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of
internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of MGM Resorts International

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the
period  ended  December  31,  2021,  and  the  related  notes  and  the  financial  statement  schedule  of  Valuation  and  Qualifying  Accounts  included  in  Item  15(a)(2),
(collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial  statements  that  was  communicated  or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the
accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Acquisition and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Valuation of CityCenter — Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements

On  September  27,  2021,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  50%  ownership  interest  in  CityCenter  Holdings,  LLC  (“CityCenter”)  held  by
Infinity  World  Development  Corp  for  cash  consideration  of  $2.125  billion.  Prior  to  the  acquisition,  the  Company  held  a  50%  ownership  interest,  which  was
accounted for under the equity method. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and the
fair  value  was  allocated  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date,  which  included  $180.0  million  of  trademarks  and  $1.4  billion  of
goodwill. Management estimated the fair value of the trademarks using the relief from royalty method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. Goodwill
was recognized as the excess of the cash consideration and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s equity method investment over the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

The  fair  value  determination  of  the  trademarks  required  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  around  expected  cash  flows  and

projected financial results, including forecasted revenues (collectively the “forecast”), as

60

well as the selection  of discount rates.  Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a significant  impact on the fair value of the trademarks  and the
recognition of goodwill. Therefore, auditing the forecast and the selection of discount rates involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, as well
as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecast and selection of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assets

and the reporting unit assigned goodwill included the following, among others:

• We tested the effectiveness of controls over determining the fair value of the tradename, including those over management’s forecast and the selection of

discount rates.

• We evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in the forecast by:

◦

◦
◦
◦

Comparing  the  forecasts  to  information  included  in  the  Company’s  communications  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  earnings  and  press  releases,
gaming industry reports, investor presentations, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies;
Comparing the forecasts to historical financial results;
Conducting inquiries with management; and
Evaluating whether the forecast was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:

◦

◦

Testing the market-based source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount
rate calculations.
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Organization. MGM Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise,

the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Aria (including
Vdara), Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, and Excalibur. The
Company also operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland, MGM Springfield in Springfield,
Massachusetts,  Borgata  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey,  Empire  City  in  Yonkers,  New  York,  MGM  Northfield  Park  in  Northfield  Park,  Ohio,  and  the  following
resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica. Additionally, the Company operates The Park, a dining and entertainment district
located  between  New  York-New  York  and  Park  MGM,  and  the  Company  owns  and  operates  Shadow  Creek,  an  exclusive  world-class  golf  course  located
approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as
an  UPREIT)  structure  in  which  substantially  all  of  its  assets  are  owned  by  and  substantially  all  of  its  business  is  conducted  through  MGM  Growth  Properties
Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”):
Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights
to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while
the Company, as the owner of the Class B share, holds a controlling interest in MGP as it is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total
voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic
interests  in  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership  does  not  fall  below  30%.  The  Company  and  MGP  each  hold  Operating  Partnership  units  representing  limited
partner interests in the Operating Partnership. The general partner of the Operating Partnership is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGP. The Operating Partnership
units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the Fair Market Value of a Class A share (as defined in
the Operating Partnership's  partnership  agreement).  The  determination  of  settlement  method  is  at  the  option  of  MGP’s  independent  conflicts  committee.  As  of
December  31,  2021,  the  Company  owned  41.5%  of  the  Operating  Partnership  units,  and  MGP  held  the  remaining  58.5%  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership.

The Company leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand
Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement between a
subsidiary  of  the Company and  a subsidiary  of  the Operating  Partnership.  The Company leases  the real  estate  assets  of Bellagio  pursuant  to a  lease  agreement
between a subsidiary of the Company and a venture that is 5% owned by such subsidiary and 95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust,
Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”). Additionally, the Company leases the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las
Vegas, pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a venture that is 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and
49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”). Further, the Company leases the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant
to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and funds managed by The Blackstone Group ("Blackstone"), as further discussed below. Refer to Note
11 for further discussion of the leases.

In January 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino ("Empire City").
Subsequently, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the master lease between
the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.

In March 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the master lease with respect to improvements made by the Company related to the rebranding

of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.

In  April  2019,  the  Company  acquired  the  membership  interests  of  Northfield  Park  Associates,  LLC  ("Northfield")  from  MGP  and  MGP  retained  the

associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM

67

Northfield Park, and added it to the master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.

On November 15, 2019, Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from the Company and leased such assets back
to the Company pursuant to a lease agreement. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of $4.25 billion,
which consisted of a 5% equity interest in the venture and cash of approximately $4.2 billion. The Company recorded a gain of $2.7 billion related to sale of the
Bellagio  real  estate  assets,  recorded  in  “Gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net”  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  which  primarily  reflects  the  difference
between the carrying value of the real estate assets sold and the consideration received. The Company also provides a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of
indebtedness  of  the  debt  of  Bellagio  BREIT  Venture’s  $3.01  billion  of  debt  (and  any  interest  accrued  and  unpaid  thereon).  Refer  to  Note  11  and  Note  12  for
additional information relating to the lease and guarantee, respectively.

In December 2019, the Company completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. See Note 16 for additional information related to this

transaction.

On February 14, 2020, the Company completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real
estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed MGP BREIT Venture. In exchange
for the contribution of the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of
the  Operating  Partnership’s  secured  indebtedness  assumed  by  MGP  BREIT  Venture,  and  the  Operating  Partnership’s  50.1%  equity  interest  in  MGP  BREIT
Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to the Company representing 5% of the equity value of
MGP BREIT Venture. The Company recorded the difference between consideration received of $2.5 billion and the carrying value of the MGM Grand Las Vegas
real  estate  assets  of  $733  million  and  selling  costs  of  $27  million  as  a  net  gain  on  sale  of  assets  of  $1.7  billion,  which  is  reflected  within  “Gain  on  REIT
transactions, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded the difference between consideration received of $2.1 billion and the
carrying  value  of  the  Mandalay  Bay  real  estate  assets  of  $2.3  billion  and  selling  costs  of  $10  million  as  a  net  loss  on  sale  of  assets  of  $252  million,  which  is
reflected  within  “Gain  on  REIT  transactions,  net”  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  In  connection  with  the  transactions,  the  Company  provides  a
shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) as further discussed in Note 12.
On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with a subsidiary of the Company for the real estate
assets  of  Mandalay  Bay  and  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  as  further  discussed  in  Note  11.  Additionally,  the  master  lease  with  MGP  was  modified  to  remove  the
Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18.

Also, on January 14, 2020, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right
following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to the Company in connection with the Company
exercising its right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem Operating Partnership units that the Company holds, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to
the ten day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption. The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and
was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or upon the Company’s receipt of cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption
of the Company’s Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that
the Company held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 24 million of the Operating
Partnership units that the Company held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.

On March 4, 2021, certain subsidiaries of the Company delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million Operating Partnership

units that they held, as further discussed in Note 13.

On August 4, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-
stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI
stock  in  exchange  for  each  MGP  Class  A  share  outstanding  and  the  Company  will  receive  1.366  units  of  the  new  VICI  operating  partnership  (“VICI  OP”)  in
exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A
share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will
redeem the majority of the Company’s VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with the Company retaining an approximate $370 million ownership

68

interest in the VICI OP (based upon the close price of VICI stock as of August 3, 2021). MGP’s Class B share that is held by the Company will be cancelled. As
part of the transaction, the Company will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The new master lease will have an initial term of 25 years,
with three 10-year renewals, and initial annual rent of $860 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter equal to the
greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary
closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021).

On September 26, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas ("The Cosmopolitan") for
cash consideration of $1.625 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is obligated to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the transaction has not closed on
or  before  June  26,  2022,  which  date  may  be  extended  by  either  party  to  a  date  on  or  prior  to  September  26,  2022 under  certain  circumstances.  The  agreement
contemplates  a  reverse  termination  fee  of  $500  million  that  is  payable  by  the  Company  in  the  event  that  the  parties  are  unable  to  obtain  antitrust  or  gaming
regulatory approval. Additionally, the Company will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan lease will have
an initial term of 30 years with three subsequent 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial
annual cash rent of $200 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during
the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. Additionally, the lease will require the Company to spend a specified percentage of net revenues over a rolling 5-year period
at the property on capital expenditures and for the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require the Company to maintain
cash security or one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 1-year period. The transaction is expected to
close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

On September 27, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC ("CityCenter") held by Infinity
World Development Corp ("Infinity World"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter is
located between Bellagio and Park MGM and consists of Aria, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort; and Vdara, a luxury condominium-hotel. Refer
to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.

On September 28, 2021, the Company sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) to funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. ("Blackstone")
for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease through which the real property is leased back to a subsidiary of the Company, as further discussed
in Note 11.

On October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from the Company and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master
lease  between  the  Company  and  MGP  through  which  MGP  leases  back  the  real  property  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Transactions  with  MGP,  including
transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.

On December 13, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment,
Inc. ("Hard Rock") for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, Hard Rock is obligated to use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing has not
occurred  on  or  before  December  13,  2022,  which  date  may  be  extended  by  either  party  to  March  13,  2023  under  certain  circumstances.  The  agreement
contemplates a reverse termination fee of $322.5 million that is payable by Hard Rock to the Company in the event that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or
gaming regulatory approval. Upon closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI (or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction is terminated) will be
amended and restated to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain
closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals.

The Company has an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which owns
MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino, hotel
and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.

Gaming  in  Macau  is  currently  administered  by  the  Macau  Government  through  concessions  awarded  to  three  different  concessionaires  and  three
subconcessionaires,  of  which  a  subsidiary  of  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  is  a  subconcessionaire.  In  2019,  the  expiration  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s
subconcession  term  was  extended  from  March  31,  2020  to  June  26,  2022,  consistent  with  the  expiration  of  the  other  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.
Pursuant to the

69

Macau  gaming  law,  upon  reaching  the  maximum  duration  of  20  years,  the  term  of  the  concessions  may  be  extended  one  or  more  times  by  order  of  the  Chief
Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming
law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill the existing
subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed
10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly.
The  approval  of  the  new  gaming  law  bill  will  precede  the  public  tender  for  the  awarding  of  new  gaming  concessions  and  to  date  the  Macau  Government  has
provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged that
it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM
Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended the casino area premises and gaming-
related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM China will cease to generate any
revenues  from  such  gaming  operations.  In  addition,  certain  events  relating  to  the  loss,  termination,  rescission,  revocation  or  modification  of  MGM  Grand
Paradise’s  gaming  subconcession  in  Macau,  where  such  events  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial  condition,  business,  properties,  or  results  of
operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and in an event of default under
MGM  China’s  revolving  credit  facilities.  MGM  China  continues  to  closely  monitor  developments  regarding  the  retendering  process  or  concession  extensions
including the issuance of guidance by the Macau Government. MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements when
known relating to the process. Management cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that it will be
able  to  obtain  a  gaming  concession  in  a  public  tender;  however,  management  believes  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  successful  in  obtaining  a  gaming
concession when a public tender is held.

The Company owns 50% of BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), which provides online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States.

The other 50% of BetMGM is owned by Entain plc.

The Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 17 for additional information about

the Company’s segments.

Financial Impact of COVID-19. The spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a
significant  impact  on  the  Company’s  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  in  2020  and  2021  and  may  continue  to  impact  the
Company's  business  in  2022  and  thereafter.  In  March  2020,  all  of  the  Company’s  domestic  properties  were  temporarily  closed  pursuant  to  state  and  local
government  restrictions  imposed  as  a  result  of  COVID-19.  Throughout  the  second  and  third  quarters  of  2020,  all  of  the  Company’s  properties  that  were
temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of the Company’s properties or portions thereof into
the  first  quarter  of  2021.  Upon  re-opening,  the  properties  continued  to  operate  without  certain  amenities  and  subject  to  certain  occupancy  limitations,  with
restrictions varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, the Company’s domestic
jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.

Although  all  of  the  Company’s  properties  have  re-opened,  in  light  of  the  unpredictable  nature  of  the  pandemic,  including  the  emergence  and  spread  of
COVID-19 variants, the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, the
Company  cannot  predict  whether  jurisdictions,  states  or  the  federal  government  will  adopt  similar  or  more  restrictive  measures  in  the  future  than  in  the  past,
including stay-at-home orders or the temporary closure of all or a portion of the Company’s properties as a result of the pandemic.

In Macau, following a temporary closure of the Company’s properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain
health safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and
bars, temperature checks, and mask protection. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong
Province  and  all  other  provinces  in  mainland  China  to  travel  to  Macau  resumed  on  August  12,  2020,  August  26,  2020  and  September  23,  2020,  respectively,
several  travel  and  entry  restrictions  in  Macau,  Hong  Kong  and  mainland  China  remain  in  place  (including  the  temporary  suspension  of  ferry  services  between
Hong  Kong  and  Macau,  the  negative  nucleic  acid  test  result  certificate,  and  mandatory  quarantine  requirements  for  returning  residents,  for  visitors  from  Hong
Kong,  Taiwan,  and  certain  regions  in  mainland  China,  and  bans  on  entry  on  other  visitors),  which  significantly  impacted  visitation  to  the  Company’s  Macau
properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was
declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened
and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances,

70

certain  entertainment  and  leisure  facilities  were  closed  throughout  Macau.  Although  gaming  and  hotel  operations  have  remained  open  during  these  states  of
immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on the Company's operations and it is uncertain whether further closures, including the closure of
the Company’s properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.

NOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting
or  similar  rights  to  direct  the  activities  of  such  entity  that  most  significantly  impact  such  entity’s  economic  performance  or  (ii)  the  equity  investment  at  risk  is
insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the
enterprise  that  has  both  of  the  following  characteristics:  (i)  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  of  the  VIE  that  most  significantly  impact  the  entity’s  economic
performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its
investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance
sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the
characteristics  or  adequacy  of  the  entity’s  equity  investments  at  risk  and  the  disposition  of  all  or  a  portion  of  an  interest  held  by  the  primary  beneficiary.  The
Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

Management has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the
activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP
and consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the
exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant to
MGP.  The  Company  has  recorded  MGP’s  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  as  noncontrolling  interest  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial
statements.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  on  a  consolidated  basis  MGP  had  total  assets  of  $10.4  billion,  primarily  related  to  its  real  estate  investments,  and  total
liabilities of $5.1 billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.

Management has determined that Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE because the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to
direct  the  activities  of  such  entity  that  most  significantly  impact  such  entity’s  economic  performance.  The  Company  has  determined  that  it  is  not  the  primary
beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture and, accordingly, does not consolidate the venture, because the Company does not have power to direct the activities that
could potentially be significant to the venture; BREIT, as the managing member, has such power. The Company has recorded its 5% ownership interest in Bellagio
BREIT Venture as an investment in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, for which such amount was $58 million as of
December 31, 2021. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its
investment, assuming no future capital funding requirements,  plus the exposure to loss resulting  from the Company’s guarantee  of the debt of Bellagio BREIT
Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of December 31, 2021, as further discussed in Note 12.

For entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the
Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest
based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in
the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  all  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  If  the  entity  does  not  qualify  for  consolidation
under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company accounts for the
entity under the equity method, such as the Company’s investments in MGP BREIT Venture and BetMGM, which do not qualify for consolidation as the Company
has  joint  control,  given  the  entities  are  structured  with  substantive  participating  rights  whereby  both  owners  participate  in  the  decision  making  process,  which
prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entities, as defined in ASC 810.

For equity interests in entities in which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company records its equity investment under ASC 321 and
reflects such investments within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of such equity investments was $66 million as of
December 31, 2021.

Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation.

71

Management’s use of estimates. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates  or  equity  interests,  assets  acquired,  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that
includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are
unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:

•
•
•
•
•

Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments under ASC 321;
Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;

Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, investments and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or
less at the date of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash
management program are recorded as “Accounts payable” or “Construction payable” as applicable.

Restricted  cash.  Restricted  cash  reflects  cash  held  in  an  escrow  account  related  to  the  reverse  termination  fee  that  was  contractually  required  to  be
prefunded for The Cosmopolitan acquisition and is reflected as "Restricted Cash" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. "Restricted Cash"
and  "Cash  and  cash  equivalents"  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  of  December  31,  2021  equal  "Cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  restricted  cash"  on  the
consolidated statements of cash flows.

Accounts receivable and credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino
accounts  receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  following  background  checks  and  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  At  December  31,  2021  and  2020,
approximately 43% and 52%, respectively, of the Company’s gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily within
Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be
uncollectible.  Recoveries  of  accounts  previously  written  off  are  recorded  when  received.  An  estimated  loss  reserve  is  maintained  to  reduce  the  Company’s
receivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The loss reserve is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as well
as  historical  collection  experience  and  current  and  expected  future  economic  and  business  conditions.  Management  believes  that  as  of  December  31,  2021,  no
significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which a loss reserve had not already been recorded.

Inventories. Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net
realizable  value.  Cost  is  determined  primarily  using  the  average  cost  method  for  food  and  beverage  and  operating  supplies.  Cost  for  retail  merchandise  is
determined using the cost method.

Property and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through
business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the
determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

72

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

15 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 15 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and
used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell
the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to
be held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of
the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the
undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a
discounted  cash  flow  model.  If  an  asset  is  still  under  development,  future  cash  flows  include  remaining  construction  costs.  All  recognized  impairment  losses,
whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Refer to Note 16 for discussion on the impairment loss recorded
on Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land in 2019.

Capitalized interest. The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.
When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of the Company’s
outstanding borrowings. Capitalization  of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief
period.

Investments  in  and  advances  to  unconsolidated  affiliates. The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equity
method.  Under  the  equity  method,  carrying  value  is  adjusted  for  the  Company’s  share  of  the  investees’  earnings  and  losses,  amortization  of  certain  basis
differences, as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return
of investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and
losses  as  well  as  gains  and  impairments  related  to  its  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  as  a  component  of  operating  income  or  loss  and  classifies  non-
operating income or losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in
such unconsolidated affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of its investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of
the  investment  to  its  carrying  value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines  whether  the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary”  based  on  its
assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a
discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach
that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.

Goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets. Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business
combinations.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain
circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No material impairments were indicated or recorded as
a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021, 2020, and 2019.

Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred
to  as  “step  zero”)  in  order  to  determine  whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  the  Company  considers
macroeconomic  conditions,  industry  and  market  considerations,  current  and  forecasted  financial  performance,  entity-specific  events,  and  changes  in  the
composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value
over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the

73

period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its
carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.

Under the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market
approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less
than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment using a
discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible
asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.

Revenue recognition. The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beverage

transactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.

The  transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  offers
discounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gaming
promoters and VIP players at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis given
the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.

For casino  wager  transactions  that  include  other  goods and  services  provided  by the  Company  to  gaming  patrons  on a  discretionary  basis  to  incentivize
gaming,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  from  the  casino  wager  transaction  to  the  good  or  service  delivered  based  upon  standalone  selling  price  (“SSP”).
Discretionary goods and services provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.

For casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of net
win  based  upon  the  SSP  of  such  incentive  (less  estimated  breakage).  This  allocation  is  deferred  and  recognized  as  revenue  when  the  customer  redeems  the
incentive. When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third-party outlets are
deducted from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. After allocating revenue to
other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue.

The  transaction  price  of  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  retail  contracts  is  the  net  amount  collected  from  the  customer  for  such  goods  and  services.  The
transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is
made for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts as
an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services and the Company is not the controlling entity, which primarily include certain of the
Company’s entertainment shows and, in certain jurisdictions, the Company’s arrangement with BetMGM for online sports betting and iGaming.

The Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings
with hotel stays and convention services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each good or service based on its relative SSP. The Company
primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold
separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.

Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,
resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip
liability,  which  represents  the  amounts  owed  in  exchange  for  gaming  chips  held  by  a  customer,  (2)  loyalty  program  obligations,  which  represents  the  deferred
allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by
customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket sales and
deposits  on  rooms  and  convention  space  or  for  unpaid  wagers.  These  liabilities  are  generally  expected  to  be  recognized  as  revenue  within  one  year  of  being
purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Reimbursed cost. Costs reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when the
Company  performs  its  related  performance  obligation  and  is  entitled  to  reimbursement.  Reimbursed  costs  related  primarily  to  the  Company’s  management  of
CityCenter (such management agreement was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021).

Revenue by source. The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage,

and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 17.

Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a
lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over
the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct
the use of the asset.

The Company classifies  a lease  with terms greater  than twelve months as either  operating  or finance.  At commencement  date, the right-of-use  (“ROU”)
assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of the
operating lease ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the
Company’s triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine
the rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’s
leases, such as its equipment leases, the Company cannot readily  determine the implicit  rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental  borrowing rate to
discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the
lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Company’s
option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are
factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the
lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.

Refer to Note 11 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee. The master lease agreement with MGP is eliminated in consolidation; refer

to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.

The Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line
item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues from third-party tenants include $43 million, $24 million and $53 million
recorded within food and beverage revenue for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $85 million, $60 million and $89 million recorded within entertainment,
retail,  and  other  revenue  for  the  same  such  periods,  respectively.  Lease  revenues  from  the  rental  of  hotel  rooms  are  recorded  as  rooms  revenues  within  the
consolidated statements of operations.

Advertising. The  Company  expenses  advertising  costs  as  incurred.  Advertising  expense  that  primarily  relates  to  media  placement  costs  and  which  is

generally included in general and administrative expenses, was $121 million, $88 million and $195 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Corporate expense. Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the Company’s
casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities,
which are expensed as incurred.

75

Preopening and start-up expenses. Preopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopening

and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.

Property transactions, net. The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on

the sale of assets as “Property transactions, net.” See Note 16 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Redeemable noncontrolling interest. Certain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which provide
for  annual  preferred  distributions  by  MGM  National  Harbor  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  parties  based  on  a  percentage  of  its  annual  net  gaming  revenue  (as
defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. The
noncontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on a
contractually agreed upon formula.

The  Company  has  recorded  the  interests  as  “Redeemable  noncontrolling  interests”  in  the  mezzanine  section  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets and not stockholders’ equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Company’s control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair value.
Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests
to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company
records any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is
adjusted  for  accrued  annual  preferred  distributions,  with  changes  caused  by  such  adjustments  recorded  within  net  income  (loss)  attributable  to  noncontrolling
interests.

Income per share of common stock. The table below reconciles basic and diluted income per share of common stock. Diluted net income attributable to
common  stockholders  includes  adjustments  for  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests.  Diluted  weighted  average  common  and  common  equivalent  shares  include
adjustments for potential dilution of share-based awards outstanding under the Company’s stock compensation plan.

Currency translation. The  Company  translates  the  financial  statements  of  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  not  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.  Balance  sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses from foreign currency
remeasurements are recorded to other non-operating income (expense).

Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss). Comprehensive  income  (loss)  includes  net  income  (loss)  and  all  other  non-stockholder  changes  in

On  September  27,  2021,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Infinity  World's  50%  ownership  interest  in  CityCenter  for  cash  consideration  of

$2.125 billion.

Through the acquisition, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests in CityCenter and therefore consolidated CityCenter as of September 27, 2021.
Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 50% ownership interest, which was accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of the equity interests of
CityCenter was determined by the transaction price and equaled $4.25 billion. The carrying value of the Company's equity method investment was less than its
share of the fair value of CityCenter at the acquisition date, resulting in a net gain of $1.6 billion upon consolidation, which is recognized as "Gain on consolidation
of CityCenter, net" on the consolidated statements of operations.

On September 28, 2021, the Company sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease
agreement pursuant to which the Company leases back the real property. The Company classified the real estate assets as held for sale as of the acquisition date and
accordingly measured the real estate assets at fair value less costs to sell, as reflected in the table below. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the lease.

The Company recognized 100% of the assets and liabilities of CityCenter at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair
value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level
3 inputs.

The following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):

The  Company  recognized  the  identifiable  intangible  assets  of  CityCenter  at  fair  value,  which  consisted  of  indefinite-lived  trade  names,  which  was

determined using methodologies under the relief from royalty method based on significant

77

inputs that were not observable. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of CityCenter in excess of identifiable assets, of which approximately
50% of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Company’s Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.

Results. CityCenter’s  net  revenue  for  the  period  from  September  27, 2021 through  December  31, 2021 was $367 million  and  operating  income  and net

income were $69 million and $68 million, respectively.

Unaudited pro forma information. The operating results for CityCenter are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the
date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the Company has been prepared assuming the Company’s acquisition
of its controlling interest had occurred as of January 1, 2020 and excludes the gain on consolidation discussed above. The pro forma information does not reflect

On  January  29,  2019,  the  Company  acquired  the  real  property  and  operations  associated  with  Empire  City  for  total  consideration  of  approximately
$865 million, plus customary working capital and other adjustments. The fair value of consideration paid included the issuance of approximately $266 million of
the Company’s common stock, the incurrence of a new bridge facility, and the remaining balance in cash. If Empire City is awarded a license for live table games
on or prior to December 31, 2022 and the Company accepts such license by December 31, 2024, the Company will pay additional consideration of $50 million.
The  acquisition  expands  the  Company’s  presence  in  the  northeast  region  and  greater  New  York  City  market.  Subsequent  to  the  Company’s  acquisition,  MGP
acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the master lease between the Company and
MGP. See Note 18 for additional information.

For the period from January 29, 2019 through December 31, 2019, Empire City’s net revenue was $193 million, operating income was $12 million and net
income  was  $36 million.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  for  the  acquisition  have  not  been  presented  because  it  is  not  material  to  the  consolidated  results  of

differences  related  to  depreciable  assets  are  being  amortized  based  on  the  useful  lives  of  the  related  assets  and  liabilities,  and  basis  differences  related  to  non–
depreciable  assets,  such  as  land  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  are  not  being  amortized.  Basis  differences  relating  to  the  Company's  investment  in

Goodwill was recognized in 2021 related to the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter, which is included in Las Vegas Strip Resorts, as

further discussed in Note 4.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession. Pursuant  to  the  agreement  dated  April  19,  2005  between  MGM  Grand  Paradise  and  SJM  Resorts  S.A.
("SJMSA", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of
chance and other casino games for a period commencing on April 20, 2005 through March 31, 2020. In March 2019, MGM Grand Paradise and SJMSA entered
into  a  Subconcession  Extension  Contract  (the  “Extension  Agreement”),  pursuant  to  which  the  gaming  subconcession  was  extended  to  June  26,  2022,  which
coincides with the current expiration of all the other concessions and subconcessions. MGM Grand Paradise paid the government of Macau approximately $25
million  and  paid  SJMSA  approximately  $2  million  as  a  contract  premium  for  such  extension.  The  Company  cannot  provide  any  assurance  that  MGM  Grand
Paradise will be awarded a gaming concession subsequent to the expiration of its gaming subconcession; however, as further discussed in Note 1, management
believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and
2020, the Company amortizes the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the Cotai land concession through January
2038.

MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield gaming licenses. The license fee paid to the State of Maryland of $22 million is considered a finite-lived
intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of its initial term of 15 years, beginning in December 2016, when MGM National Harbor
started operations. The license fee paid to the State of Massachusetts of $85 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized over a period of
15 years, beginning in August 2018, when MGM Springfield started operations.

82

Total amortization expense related to intangible assets was $197 million, $194 million and $192 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of

December 31, 2021, estimated future amortization is as follows:

Senior credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s senior credit facility consisted of a $1.675 billion revolving facility of which no amounts

were drawn.

On February 14, 2020, in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Company used proceeds from the transaction to repay and terminate
the $1.5 billion outstanding on its then existing revolving facility in full and entered into an unsecured credit agreement, comprised of a  $1.5 billion unsecured
revolving facility that would mature in February 2025. As a result, the Company incurred a $4 million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in “Other, net” in
the consolidated statements of operations.

84

In  April  2020  and  then  in  February  2021,  the  Company  amended  its  credit  facility  to  provide  it  with  certain  relief  from  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic, including certain financial maintenance covenant waivers, agreeing to liquidity tests, and pledging the Operating Partnership units held by loan parties
to  the  lenders  as  collateral.  In November  2021,  the  Company terminated  its  existing  revolving  facility  and  entered  into a  new $1.675 billion  secured  revolving
credit facility that matures in November 2026. The revolving credit facility bears interest of SOFR plus 1.50% to 2.25% determined by reference to a rent adjusted
total net leverage ratio pricing grid.

The Company's senior revolving credit  facility  is, subject to gaming approval, guaranteed by each of the Company's existing direct  and indirect  wholly-
owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions. The senior revolving credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity in certain of
the  Company's  domestic  operating  properties.  Mandatory  prepayments  will  be  required  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  sales  of  certain  assets,
subject to certain exceptions. The Company’s senior revolving credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and positive
and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with its applicable covenants at December 31, 2021.

Operating  Partnership  senior  credit  facility  and  bridge  facility. At  December  31,  2021,  the  Operating  Partnership’s  senior  secured  credit  facility
consisted of a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility. The revolving facility bears interest of LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.25% determined by reference to a total net
leverage ratio pricing grid and will mature in June 2023. At December 31, 2021, $50 million was drawn on the revolving credit facility and the interest rate on the
revolving credit facility was 1.85%.

In February 2020, in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Operating Partnership amended its senior secured credit facility to, among
other things, allow for the transaction to occur, permit the incurrence by the Operating Partnership of a nonrecourse guarantee relating to the debt of MGP BREIT
Venture (refer to Note 12 for description of such guarantee), and permit the incurrence of the bridge loan facility. As a result of the transaction and the amendment,
the Operating Partnership repaid its $1.3 billion outstanding term loan B facility in full with the proceeds of a bridge facility, which was then assumed by MGP
BREIT Venture as partial consideration for the Operating Partnership’s contribution. Additionally, the Operating Partnership used the proceeds from the settlement
of the forward equity issuances to pay off the outstanding balance of $399 million on its term loan A facility in full. As a result, the Operating Partnership incurred
an $18 million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.

The  Operating  Partnership  is  party  to  interest  rate  swaps  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  interest  rate  volatility  inherent  in  its  variable  rate  debt  as  well  as
forecasted debt issuances. As of December 31, 2021, the Operating Partnership has currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which it pays a weighted
average fixed rate of 1.783% on total notional amount of $700 million. The Operating Partnership has an additional $900 million total notional amount of forward
starting interest rate swaps that are not currently effective. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $25 million, with $5 million
recorded as a current liability and $20 million recorded as a long-term liability as of December 31, 2021, and $41 million, with $1 million recorded as a current
liability and $40 million recorded as a long-term liability, as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as cash flow hedges was
$27 million,  with  $8 million recorded  as  a  current  liability  and  $19 million recorded  as  a  long-term  liability  as  of  December  31,  2021,  and  $78  million,  with
$31 million recorded  as a current  liability  and $47 million  recorded  as a long-term  liability,  as of December  31, 2020. Interest  rate  swaps in a current  liability
position  are  recorded  within  “Other  accrued  expenses,”  and  those  in  a  long-term  liability  position  are  recorded  within  “Other  long-term  obligations”  on  the
consolidated balance sheets.

The  Operating  Partnership  credit  facility  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default  and  positive  and  negative  covenants,
including that the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, a maximum total net debt to
adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at December 31, 2021.

The Operating Partnership senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of the Operating Partnership’s existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirect
wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, except for MGM Springfield reDevelopment, which owns the real estate assets of MGM Springfield, and
secured  by  a  first  priority  lien  security  interest  on  substantially  all  of  the  Operating  Partnership’s  and  such  restricted  subsidiaries’  material  assets,  including
mortgages  on  its  real  estate,  excluding  the  real  estate  assets  of  MGM  National  Harbor,  Empire  City,  and  MGM  Springfield  and  subject  to  other  customary
exclusions.

MGM China first revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the MGM China first revolving credit facility consisted of a $1.25 billion unsecured
revolving credit facility. The MGM China first revolving credit facility bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate
(“HIBOR”) plus 1.625% to 2.75%, as

85

determined by MGM China’s leverage ratio and will mature in May 2024. At December 31, 2021, $360 million was drawn on the MGM China first revolving
credit facility and the weighted average interest rate was 2.95%.

The  MGM China  first  revolving  credit  facility  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  and  positive,  negative  and  financial
covenants,  including  that  MGM  China  maintains  compliance  with  a  maximum  leverage  ratio  and  a  minimum  interest  coverage  ratio.  In  February  2021,  MGM
China amended its credit agreement to provide for a waiver of its maximum leverage ratio and its minimum interest coverage ratio through the fourth quarter of
2022. MGM China was in compliance  with its applicable  MGM China credit  facility  covenants at December  31, 2021. In February 2022, MGM China further
amended its first revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity.

MGM  China  second  revolving  credit  facility.  At  December  31,  2021,  the  MGM  China  second  revolving  credit  facility  consisted  of  a  $400  million
unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase the amount of the facility up to $500 million, subject to certain conditions. The MGM China second
credit facility bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on HIBOR plus 1.625% to 2.75%, as determined by MGM China’s leverage ratio and will mature
in May 2024. Draws will be subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including evidence that the MGM China first revolving credit facility has been
fully drawn. At December 31, 2021, no amounts were drawn on the MGM China second revolving credit facility.

The MGM China second credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,
including that MGM China maintains compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In
February 2021, MGM China further amended its second credit facility agreement to provide for a waiver of its maximum leverage ratio and its minimum interest
coverage  ratio  through  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  MGM  China  was  in  compliance  with  its  applicable  MGM  China  second  credit  facility  covenants  at
December 31, 2021. In February 2022, MGM China further amended its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity.

Each  series  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  senior  notes  are  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed,  jointly  and  severally,  on  a  senior  basis  by  all  of  the
Operating Partnership’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Operating Partnership’s credit facilities, other than MGP Finance Co-Issuer, Inc., which is a co-issuer of the
senior notes. The Operating Partnership may redeem all or part of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes
plus, to the extent the Operating Partnership is redeeming senior notes prior to the date that is three months prior to their maturity date, an applicable make whole
premium,  plus,  in  each  case,  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  The  indentures  governing  the  senior  notes  contain  customary  covenants  and  events  of  default.  These
covenants  are  subject  to  a  number  of  important  exceptions  and  qualifications  set  forth  in  the  applicable  indentures  governing  the  senior  notes,  including,  with
respect to the restricted payments covenants, the ability to make unlimited restricted payments to maintain the REIT status of MGP.

In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act contains certain income
tax  provisions  that  are  beneficial  to  the  Company;  namely,  the  relaxation  of  the  interest  expense  deduction  limitation  for  the  2019  and  2020  tax  years  and  the
allowance of a 5-year carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) incurred during tax years 2018 through 2020. The Company has recorded a federal income tax
receivable of $226 million to reflect the carryback of its 2020 NOL. Furthermore, since the NOL was carried back to tax years when the federal income tax rate
was 35%, compared to the 21% rate currently in effect, the Company realized $90 million more income tax benefit than if it would have only been able to carry the
NOL forward.

The  Company  has  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  of  $2.7  billion  on  its  foreign  tax  credit  (“FTC”)  carryover  of  $3.1  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021,
resulting in an FTC net deferred tax asset of $332 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in
Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the
Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company generally does not expect to
generate new FTC carryovers after the year ended December 31, 2017, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the extent that it has active foreign
source income during the 10-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of 50% of U.S. taxable income each
year, of overall domestic losses that totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company relies on future U.S. source

89

operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The
FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $297 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $780 million in 2024; $674 million in 2025; $134 million in
2026; and $200 million in 2027.

The Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S.
operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to
such  assumptions  could  result  in  a  material  change  in  the  valuation  allowance  with  a  corresponding  impact  on  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  period
including such change.

On March 30, 2020, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of its exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits through
June 26, 2022, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. Absent the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits, “Net
income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $10 million in 2021 and increased by $4 million in 2020 and diluted earnings per
share would have decreased by $0.02 in 2021 and increased by $0.01 in 2020. The Company continues to assume that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau
12% complementary tax on gaming profits for all periods beyond June 26, 2022 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax
assets and liabilities.

Non-gaming  operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.  At  December  31,  2021,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  a  complementary  tax  NOL

carryforward of $1.5 billion resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized in years 2022 through 2024.

MGM Grand Paradise’s exemption from the 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGM
China. On July 26, 2021, MGM Grand Paradise extended its agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be
due by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment regardless of the amount of distributable dividends. The
extension covers distributions of gaming profits earned for the period April 1, 2020 through June 26, 2022. The agreement requires payments of approximately
$1 million for the period April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, $2 million for January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and $1 million for the period
January 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022. The Company recorded $3 million of income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 under the extension.

The Company has NOLs in certain of the states in which it operates that total $536 million as of December 31, 2021, which equates to deferred tax assets of
$35 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. The majority of these NOL carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2025 through 2040 with
the  remaining  being  carried  forward  indefinitely.  The  Company  has  provided  a  valuation  allowance  of  $6  million  on  certain  of  its  state  deferred  tax  assets,
including a portion of NOLs described above.

In addition, there is a valuation allowance of $146 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $3 million on Hong Kong

NOLs because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $11 million and $9 million at December 31, 2021

and 2020, respectively.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were not material for each of the periods

presented.

90

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income
taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2021, the IRS can generally no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2016.
During  the  twelve  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  reached  a  settlement  with  the  IRS  Appeals  Office  on  the  examination  of  its  2014  U.S.
consolidated federal income tax return. No cash tax payments were due as a result of the settlement.

As of December 31, 2021, other than adjustments resulting from the federal and state income tax audits discussed herein, the various state and local tax
jurisdictions  in  which  the  Company  files  tax  returns  can  no  longer  assess  tax  with  respect  to  years  ended  prior  to  2016.  However,  such  state  and  local  tax
jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generated in such years that are utilized in subsequent years. During 2021, an examination of income tax returns filed in New Jersey
for tax years 2015 through 2018 closed with no change and an examination of income tax returns filed in Massachusetts for tax years 2017 and 2018 closed with no
material adjustments. Additionally, the Company's income tax returns filed in New York City for the tax years 2017 through 2019 are currently under examination.
The Company does not anticipate any material adjustments upon resolution of this audit.

The Company received a final audit determination with respect to the examination of income tax returns filed in the state of Michigan for tax years 2014
through 2018. The Company had an informal conference with the Michigan Department of Treasury Hearings Division to contest the findings of the audit. The
Hearings Division issued its decision and order and now the Company is determining its next course of action. Any final adjustments upon resolution of this matter
are not expected to be material.

The  Company  believes  that  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  total  amounts  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits  at  December  31,  2021  may  decrease  by  up  to

$13 million within the next twelve months on the expectation of resolution of a tax accounting method related to its customer loyalty program.

NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation. The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not

Vegas, owned by MGP BREIT Venture, and the debt obligation. This guarantee is accounted for under ASC 460 at fair value; such value is immaterial.

Multiemployer benefit plans. The Company currently participates in multiemployer pension plans in which the risks of participating differs from single-

employer plans in the following aspects:

a)

b)

c)

d)

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;

If  a  participating  employer  stops  contributing  to  the  plan,  the  unfunded  obligations  of  the  plan  may  be  borne  by  the  remaining  participating
employers;

If an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the
underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability; and

If the plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liability
payments, employers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference.

The Company’s participation in these plans is presented below.

on the note, amortizes  into  interest  income  using the effective  interest  method  over the length  of the agreement.  The carrying  value  of the note receivable  was
$155 million and $144 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was recorded within “Other long-term assets, net” in the consolidated balance
sheets.

During the third quarter  of 2019, the Company recorded  a non-cash  impairment  charge  of $219 million,  which reflects  the amount by which the assets’
carrying  value  exceeds  the  assets’  fair  value  (expected  selling  price).  The  Company  further  recognized  a  loss  of  $2  million  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019
primarily  relating  to  selling  costs.  The  assets  and  liabilities  of  Circus  Circus  Las  Vegas  and  the  adjacent  land  of  $810  million  and  $14  million,  respectively,
primarily  consisted  of  property  and  equipment,  net  of  $785  million.  Circus  Circus  Las  Vegas  was  not  classified  as  discontinued  operations  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2019 because the Company concluded that the sale is not a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results
and it does not represent a major geographic segment or product line.

Other. Other property transactions, net in 2021 includes a gain of $76 million relating to the sale of art and a gain of $29 million related to a reduction in
the  estimate  of  contingent  consideration  related  to  the  Empire  City  acquisition,  partially  offset  by  an  other-than-temporary  impairment  charge  of  $22  million
related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, as discussed in Note 6, as well as miscellaneous asset disposals and write-downs.

Other property transactions, net in 2020 includes other-than-temporary impairment charges of $64 million related to an investment in an unconsolidated

affiliate, as discussed in Note 6, a loss of $17 million related to production show costs, as well as miscellaneous asset disposals and write-downs.

Other property transactions, net for 2019 includes miscellaneous asset disposals and demolition costs.

NOTE 17 — SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic
characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate and their management and reporting
structure. The Company has aggregated its operating segments into the following reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM
China.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon acquisition in September 2021),
Bellagio,  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas  (including  The  Signature),  Mandalay  Bay  (including  Delano  and  Four  Seasons),  The  Mirage,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York
(including The Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).

Regional Operations. Regional  Operations  consists  of  the  following  casino  resorts:  MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,
Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM
Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park,
Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).

MGM China. MGM China consists of MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

The Company’s operations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, MGM Northfield Park (prior to April 1, 2019 as the operations were owned
by MGP until that date), and certain other corporate operations and management services have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these
operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

Adjusted  Property  EBITDAR  is  the  Company’s  reportable  segment  GAAP  measure,  which  management  utilizes  as  the  primary  profit  measure  for  its
reportable  segments  and underlying  operating  segments.  Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure  defined as earnings before  interest  and other non-operating
income (expense), taxes, depreciation  and amortization,  preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions,  net, restructuring  costs (which represents
costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan),
rent expense associated with triple-net operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, property
transactions,  net,  and  excludes  gain  on  consolidation  of  CityCenter,  net,  gain  related  to  CityCenter's  sale  of  Harmon  land  recorded  within  income  from
unconsolidated  affiliates,  and  corporate  expense  (which  includes  CEO transition  expense  and  October  1  litigation  settlement)  and  stock  compensation  expense,
which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminates in consolidation.

Management  agreements.  Until  the  Company's  acquisition  of  CityCenter  in  September  2021,  the  Company  was  party  to  a  management  agreement
pursuant to which it managed the operations of CityCenter for a fee of 2% of revenue and 5% of EBITDA (as defined within the management agreement) for Aria
and Vdara. The Company earned fees of $29 million, $16 million and $48 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The
Company incurred costs reimbursable by CityCenter, primarily for employee compensation and certain allocated costs in performing the Company's management
services,  of  $187 million,  $212  million  and $420  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  As of December  31, 2020,
CityCenter owed the Company $39 million for management services and reimbursable costs recorded in “Accounts receivable, net” on the consolidated balance
sheets. The management agreement was terminated in connection with the Company's acquisition of CityCenter, as discussed in Note 4.

MGM China

Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms. Ho”) is the Co-Chairperson of the Board of Directors of, and holds a minority ownership interest in, MGM China.
Ms. Ho is also the managing director of Shun Tak Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries “Shun Tak”), a leading conglomerate in Hong Kong with core
businesses in transportation, property, hospitality and investments. Shun Tak provides various services and products, including ferry tickets, travel products, rental
of hotel rooms, laundry services and property cleaning services to MGM China. In addition, MGM China leases transportation equipment and office space from
Shun Tak. MGM China incurred expenses relating to Shun Tak of $7 million, $7 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

In addition, Ms. Ho indirectly holds a 50% interest in an entity that provides, along with its subsidiary, marketing and public relations consulting services,
including for the retendering of MGM China's gaming subconcession, to MGM China, which totaled $4 million, $1 million, and $4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Grand  Paradise  Macau  deferred  cash  payment. On  September  1,  2016,  the  Company  purchased  188.1  million  common  shares  of  its  MGM  China

subsidiary from Grand Paradise Macau (“GPM”), an entity controlled by Ms. Ho. As

103

part  of  the  consideration  for  the  purchase,  the  Company  agreed  to  pay  GPM  or  its  nominee  a  deferred  cash  payment  of  $50  million.  The  payments  included
amounts equal to the ordinary dividends received on such shares, with a final lump sum payment due on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction,
which was made in September 2021. Such amounts were paid to Expert Angels Limited, an entity controlled by an immediate family member of Ms. Ho. As of
December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a remaining liability on a discounted basis of $33 million in “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance
sheets.

MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd. (together with its subsidiary MGM Development Services, Ltd., “MGM Branding and Development”), an
entity included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in which Ms. Ho indirectly holds a noncontrolling interest, is party to a brand license agreement
and  a development  services  agreement  with MGM China,  for  which the  related  amounts  are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  An entity  owned by Ms. Ho received
distributions of $8 million, $5 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the ownership of a
noncontrolling interest in MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd.

MGP

As further described in Note 1, pursuant to the master lease with MGP, the Company leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New
York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield
Park, and MGM Springfield from MGP.

MGP master lease. The MGP master lease has an initial lease term of 10 years that began on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National
Harbor, as described below) with the potential to extend the term for four additional 5-year terms thereafter at the option of the Company (with additional renewal
options with respect to MGM Springfield, as described below). The MGP master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estate
under the master lease at the time of the extension. The MGP master lease provides that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on April 31,
2024. Thereafter,  the initial  term  of  the MGP master  lease  with respect  to MGM National  Harbor  may be  renewed  at  the option  of the  Company for  an initial
renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether the Company elects
to renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial 10-year term). If, however, the Company chooses not to renew
the lease with respect  to MGM National  Harbor after  the initial  MGM National  Harbor term under the master  lease,  the Company would also lose the right  to
renew  the  MGP  master  lease  with  respect  to  the  rest  of  the  properties  when  the  initial  10-year  lease  term  ends  related  to  the  rest  of  the  properties  in  2026.  In
addition to the four 5-year renewal terms, the term of the lease with respect to MGM Springfield may be extended for an additional four 5-year renewal terms. The
MGP master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Company to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground
lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer
with respect to any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City, which MGP may exercise should the Company
elect to sell this property in the future.

Rent under the MGP master lease consists of a base rent component and a percentage rent component. As of December 31, 2021, the base rent represents
approximately  91% of the rent payments due and the percentage  rent represents  approximately  9% of the rent payments due under the MGP master  lease. The
MGP master  lease  also provides  for  fixed  annual  escalators  of 2%  on the  base  rent  through  the sixth  lease  year  and  the  possibility  for  additional  2%  increases
thereafter  subject  to  the  tenant  and  operating  subsidiary  sublessee,  collectively,  meeting  an  adjusted  net  revenue  to  rent  ratio,  as  well  as  potential  increases  in
percentage  rent  in  year  six  and  every  five  years  thereafter  based  on  a  percentage  of  average  actual  annual  net  revenue  during  the  preceding  five  year  period
calculated  in  accordance  with the  terms  under  the  master  lease.  With  respect  to the  additional  renewal  terms  for MGM Springfield,  for the first  two additional
renewal terms, base rent will include a fixed annual rent escalator of 2.0%, subject to the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as discussed above. For each lease year
subsequent  to  the  first  two  additional  renewal  terms,  the  base  rent  shall  be  the  Fair  Market  Rent  (as  defined  in  the  MGP  master  lease)  in  respect  of  MGM
Springfield. The MGP master lease also contains customary events of default and financial covenants; provided that the tenant will not be in default of the financial
covenants in the event there is an unavoidable delay (as such term is defined in the lease). The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of
December 31, 2021.

Subsequent to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire
City  from  the  Company  for  consideration  of  approximately  $634  million,  which  included  the  assumption  of  debt  of  approximately  $246  million,  which  was
immediately repaid, and the remainder in issuance of Operating Partnership units. The real estate assets of Empire City were then leased to the Company pursuant
to an amendment to the MGP master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent
with the MGP master lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually

104

grow at 2% per year until 2022. As disclosed above, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to
the  property  to  the  extent  the  Company  develops  additional  gaming  facilities,  which  MGP  may  exercise  should  the  Company  elect  to  sell  this  property  in  the
future.

On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing MGP master lease with respect to the Park MGM Transaction. In connection
with the transaction, the Company received consideration of $638 million, of which approximately $606 million was paid in cash and the remainder in issuance of
Operating Partnership units. Additionally, the annual rent payment to MGP was increased by $50 million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent
with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.

Additionally, on April 1, 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, which held the operations of Northfield, for fair
value of consideration of approximately $305 million consisting primarily of approximately  9 million Operating Partnership units that were ultimately redeemed
by the Operating Partnership, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was
then added to the existing MGP master lease with MGP, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $60 million. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90%
of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.

The  annual  rent  payments  under  the  MGP  master  lease  for  the  fourth  lease  year,  which  commenced  on  April  1,  2019,  increased  to  $946  million  from
$770 million  at  the start  of the  third lease  year. The increase  was a result  of the $50 million  in additional  rent  for each  of the Park MGM Transaction  and the
addition of Empire City in the beginning of 2019, the $60 million of additional rent for MGM Northfield Park, which entered the Master Lease on April 1, 2019, as
well as the third 2% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2019.

On February 14, 2020, the Company amended the MGP master lease to remove Mandalay Bay from such master lease and the annual rent under the MGP

master lease was reduced by $133 million to $813 million.

The annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the fifth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2020, increased to $828 million from

$813 million, as a result of the fourth 2% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2020.

The annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the sixth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2021, increased to $843 million from

$828 million, as a result of the fifth 2% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2021.

In October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from the Company for $400 million of cash consideration, which was accounted
for  as  a  transaction  between  entities  under  common  control.  The  Company  adjusted  the  carrying  value  of  noncontrolling  interests  to  adjust  for  its  share  of  the
difference  between  the  carrying  value  of the  net  assets  transferred  and  the  consideration  received,  with  offsetting  adjustments  to capital  in  excess  of par  value.
MGM  Springfield  was  added  to  the  master  lease  between  the  Company  and  MGP.  Following  the  closing  of  the  transaction,  the  annual  rent  payment  to  MGP
increased from $843 million to $873 million, reflecting the addition of MGM Springfield, which increased the annual rent payment by $30 million, $27 million of
which  will  be  fixed  and  contractually  grow  at  2%  per  year  with  escalators  subject  to  the  adjusted  net  revenue  to  rent  ratio,  as  further  described  above.  Final
regulatory approvals, which were not necessary for the transaction to close, are expected to be received within nine to twelve months following the close of the
transaction. Until final regulatory approvals are obtained, the parties will be subject to a trust agreement, which provides for the property to go into a trust (or, at
the Company’s option, be returned to the Company) during the interim period in the event that the regulator finds reasonable cause to believe that MGP may not be
found suitable. The property will then remain in trust until a final determination regarding MGP’s suitability is made.

Additionally, refer to Note 1 for discussion relating to the waiver agreement with MGP and the Operating Partnership units redeemed in 2020 thereunder.

All  intercompany  transactions,  including  transactions  under  the  MGP  master  lease,  have  been  eliminated  in  the  Company’s  consolidation  of  MGP.  The

public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As further described in Note 1, in August 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-
for-stock transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The transaction is expected to close
in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29,
2021).

controls  and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (“the  Exchange  Act”))  were
effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  regulations  and  to  provide  that  such  information  is
accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. This conclusion is based on an evaluation as required by
Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act conducted under the supervision and participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer along with company management.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management’s Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-

15(f) of the Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In  establishing  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  management  has  developed  and  maintained  a  system  of  internal  control,  policies  and
procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  contained  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information
presented in this annual report is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
respects  the  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the  Company  as  of  and  for  the  periods  presented  in  this  annual  report.  These  include
controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  this  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company’s  management,  including  its  principal
executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer,  as  appropriate  for  all  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  Significant  elements  of  the  Company’s
internal control over financial reporting include, for example:

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them appropriately;

•
• Written accounting policies;
• Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;
•
•
•

Segregation of incompatible duties;
Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control; and
Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Management’s Evaluation

Management,  with  the  participation  of  the  Company’s  principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer,  has  evaluated  the  Company’s  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  using  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based  on  its  evaluation  as  of  December  31,  2021,  management  believes  that  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  effective  in

achieving the objectives described above.

employment with the Employer shall terminate as of the date Employee commences such other employment, and pursuant to
Section  19  Employee’s  new  Company-affiliated  employer  shall  assume  all  rights  and  obligations  of  Employer  under  this
Agreement.

Term. The term of Employee’s employment under this Agreement commences on July 6, 2021 and it terminates on July 6,
2024 (the “Specified Term”), unless a new written employment agreement is executed by the parties. If Employee remains
employed  after  the  expiration  of  the  Specified  Term,  and  the  parties  do  not  execute  a  new  employment  agreement,  then
Employee  shall  be  employed  at-will  and  none  of  the  provisions  of  the  Agreement  shall  apply  to  Employee’s  continued
employment  at-will,  except  Sections  8,  10.5,  11  and  12,  and  Employer  shall  have  the  right  to  terminate  Employee’s
employment with or without cause or notice, for any reason or no reason, and (unless otherwise provided herein) without any
payment of severance or compensation.

Compensation. During the Specified Term, Employer shall pay Employee a minimum annual salary of $850,000 payable in
arrears at such frequencies and times as Employer pays its other employees. Employee is also eligible to receive employee
and fringe benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to employees having the rank of the second highest senior
executive  of  the  Company.  Employer  will  also  reimburse  Employee  for  all  reasonable  business  and  non-commute  related
travel  expenses  Employee  incurs  in  performing  Employee’s  duties  under  this  Agreement,  payable  in  accordance  with
Employer’s  customary  practices  and  policies,  as  Employer  may  modify  and  amend  them  from  time  to  time.  Employee’s
performance may be reviewed periodically. Employee is eligible for consideration for a discretionary raise, bonuses (whether
in cash or equity or equity-based awards), promotion, and/or participation in discretionary benefit plans; provided, however,
whether  and  to  what  extent  Employee  will  be  granted  any  of  the  above  will  be  determined  by  Employer  in  its  sole  and
absolute discretion.

3.1

3.2

In addition, Employee is eligible for consideration for a discretionary annual bonus in accordance with the terms and
conditions  of  the  Employer’s  Second  Amended  and  Restated  Annual  Performance-Based  Incentive  Plan  for
Executive Officers, or any successor plan (the “Program”). Employee will be eligible for consideration for an annual
bonus up to 150% of Employee’s base salary (the “Target Bonus”). The terms and conditions of the Program may be
changed from time to time. For the 2021 year, Employee’s bonus will be calculated on a full year basis with no pro
ration.

During  the  Specified  Term,  it  is  anticipated  that  Employee  will  be  required  to  travel  extensively  on  behalf  of
Employer.  Such  travel,  if  by  air,  may  be  on  aircraft  provided  by  Employer  (if  authorized  by  the  Chief  Executive
Officer), or if commercial airlines are used, on a first-class basis (or best available basis, if first class is not available).

3.3

3.4

Employee  shall  be  eligible  for  annual  equity  awards  in  forms  and  amounts  determined  by  the  Compensation
Committee  in  its  discretion.  It  is  the  Compensation  Committee’s  present  expectation  that  such  annual  awards  will
have an aggregate grant-date Accounting Value targeted at $2,550,000 and that the grant in 2021 will be calculated on
a full year basis with no pro ration. Any annual or other equity awards granted on or after the Effective Date shall be
subject  to  such  terms  as  the  Compensation  Committee  may  determine  in  its  discretion.  Employee  will  receive  an
initial  grant  of  75,000  Restricted  Stock  Units (“ RSUs”)  on  the  first  business  day  of  the  month  succeeding
Employee’s first date of employment (the “Grant Date”), pursuant to the MGM Resorts International Amended and
Restated 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Omnibus Plan”), which shall vest in two
equal annual installments on each of the first two anniversaries of the Grant Date, and otherwise shall be subject to
the  terms  set  forth  in  the  Company’s  current  standard  form  of  award  agreement  for  RSUs  attached  as  Exhibit  A
hereto.

Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  with  respect  to  any  regular  annual  incentive  awards  granted  to
Employee during the Specified Term under the Omnibus Plan or any successor thereto (but excluding any one-time or
special retention awards, as determined by the Compensation Committee), the applicable award agreements for such
awards shall include provisions with respect (i) death or Disability, (ii) termination by Employer other than by reason
of “Employer’s Good Cause” and (iii) termination by Employee by reason of “Participant’s Good Cause” that shall be
no less favorable to Employee than as set forth in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto for RSUs and, with respect to
Relative Performance Share Units, the Form of Relative Performance Share Unit Agreement filed Exhibit 10.5(45) to
the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Form 10-K”) and the Form
of Performance Shae Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.5(41) to the Form 10-K.

5.

Extent of Services. Employee agrees that Employee’s employment by Employer is full time and exclusive. Employee further
agrees to perform Employee’s duties in a competent, trustworthy and businesslike manner. Except with respect to the entities
and positions noted on Exhibit B, Employee agrees that during the Specified Term, Employee will not render any services of
any kind (whether or not for compensation) for any person or entity other than Employer, and that Employee will not engage
in any other business activity (whether or not for compensation) that is similar to or conflicts with Employee’s duties under
this  Agreement,  without  the  approval  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  MGM  Resorts  International  or  the  person  or  persons
designated by the Board of Directors to determine such matters.

Policies and Procedures. Employee agrees and acknowledges that Employee is bound by Employer’s policies and procedures
as they may be modified, amended or adopted by Employer from time to time, including, but not limited to, the Company’s
Code of Conduct and Conflict of Interest policies. In the event the terms in this Agreement conflict with Employer’s policies
and procedures,  the terms of this Agreement  shall take precedence.  As Employee is aware, problem gaming and underage
gambling  can  have  adverse  effects  on  individuals  and  the  gaming  industry  as  a  whole.  Employee  acknowledges  that
Employee has read and is familiar with Employer’s policies, procedures and manuals and agrees to abide by them. Because
these matters are of such importance to Employer, Employee specifically confirms that Employee is familiar with and will
comply  with  Employer’s  policies  of prohibiting  underage  gaming,  supporting  programs  to treat  compulsive  gambling,  and
promoting diversity in all aspects of Employer’s business.

Licensing Requirements. Employee acknowledges that Employer is engaged in a business that is or may be subject to and
exists  because  of  privileged  licenses  issued  by  governmental  authorities  in  Nevada,  Michigan,  Mississippi,  Maryland,
Massachusetts,  Ohio,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  Macau  S.A.R.,  and  other  jurisdictions  in  which  Employer  is  engaged  in  a
gaming  business  or  where  Employer  has  applied  to  (or  during  the  Specified  Term  may  apply  to)  engage  in  a  gaming
business. Employee shall apply for and obtain any license, qualification, clearance or other similar approval which Employer
or any regulatory authority which has jurisdiction over Employer requests or requires that Employee obtain.

Failure to Satisfy Licensing Requirement. Employer has the right to terminate Employee’s employment under Section 10.1 of
this  Agreement  if:  (i)  Employee  fails  to  satisfy  any  licensing  requirement  referred  to  in  Section  6  above;  (ii)  Employer  is
directed  to  cease  business  with  Employee  by  any  governmental  authority  referred  to  in  Section  6  above;  (iii)  Employer
determines, in its sole and exclusive judgment, that Employee was, is or might be involved in, or are about to be involved in,
any activity, relationship(s) or circumstance which could or does jeopardize Employer’s business, reputation or such licenses;
or (iv) any of Employer’s licenses is threatened to be, or is, denied, curtailed, suspended or revoked as a result of Employee’s
employment by Employer or as a result of Employee’s actions.

Restrictive  Covenants.  Employee  acknowledges  that,  in  the  course  of  performing  Employee’s  responsibilities  under  this
Agreement,  Employee  will  form  relationships  and  become  acquainted  with  “Confidential  Information”  (defined  below  in
Section  21).  Employee  further  acknowledges  that  such  relationships  and  the  Confidential  Information  are  valuable  to
Employer and the Company, and the restrictions on Employee’s future employment contained in this Agreement, if any, are
reasonably  necessary  in  order  for  Employer  to  remain  competitive  in  Employer’s  various  businesses  and  to  prevent
Employee  from  engaging  in  unfair  competition  against  Employer  after  termination  of  Employee’s  employment  with
Employer for any reason.

In consideration of this Agreement and the compensation payable to Employee under this Agreement, and in recognition of
Employer’s  heightened  need  for  protection  from  abuse  of  relationships  formed  or  disclosure  and  misuse  of  Confidential
Information garnered before and during the Specified Term of this Agreement, Employee covenants and agree as follows:

8.1

Competition. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in Paragraph 10 of this Agreement, during the entire Specified
Term  and  thereafter  for  the  “Restrictive  Period”  (defined  below  in  Section  21)  Employee  shall  not  directly  or
indirectly  be  employed  by,  provide  consultation  or  other  services  to,  engage  in,  participate  in  or  otherwise  be
connected  in  any  way  with  any  “Competitor”  (defined  below  in  Section  21)  in  any  capacity  that  is  the  same,
substantially  the  same  or  similar  to  the  position  or  capacity  (irrespective  of  title  or  department)  as  that  held  at  any
time during Employee’s employment with Employer; provided, however, that if Employee remains employed at-will
by  Employer  after  expiration  of  the  Specified  Term  and  is  thereafter  separated  by  Employer  during  the  Restrictive
Period  for  any  reason  other  than  “Employer’s  Good  Cause”  (defined  below  in  Section  21),  Employee  shall  not  be
subject to this Section 8.1.

8.2

Non-Solicitation.  At  all  times  during  Employee’s  employment  with  the  Company  and  at  all  times  thereafter,
Employee shall not use, access, disclose, make known to, or otherwise disseminate for personal gain or for the benefit
of a third party (or induce, encourage or assist others in doing any of the foregoing acts) any

3

Company  “Trade  Secrets”  (as  defined  in  Section  21)  for  any  purpose  whatsoever.  Further,  at  all  times  during
Employee’s  employment  with  the  Company,  and  for  12  months  thereafter,  Employee  will  not,  without  the  prior
written consent of Company:

(a)

(b)

(c)

make known to any Competitor and/or any member, manager, officer, director, employee or agent of a
Competitor, the “Business Contacts” (defined in Section 21) of the Company;

call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or
take away, any Business Contacts of the Company; and/or

approach,  solicit,  contract  with  or  hire  any  current  Business  Contacts  of  the  Company  or  entice  any
Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with the Company or end his/her employment with
the Company, without the prior written consent of Company, in each and every instance, such consent
to be within Company’s sole and absolute discretion.

8.3

Confidentiality. At all times during Employee’s employment with the Company, and at all times thereafter, Employee
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel in each and
every instance—such consent to be within the Company’s sole and absolute discretion—use, disclose or make known
to  any  person,  entity  or  other  third  party  outside  of  the  Company  any  Confidential  Information  belonging  to  the
Company or its individual members.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 8.3 shall not apply to Confidential Information: (i) that is
required to be disclosed by law or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including
any  committee  thereof)  in  any  litigation,  arbitration,  mediation  or  legislative  hearing,  with  jurisdiction  to  order
Employee to disclose or make accessible any information, provided, however, that Employee provides Company with
ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such disclosure to enable Company to seek a protective order or other relief
to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  such  Confidential  Information;  (ii)  that  becomes  generally  known  to  the  public  or
within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Employee’s or any third party’s violation of this Agreement or
other  obligation  of  confidentiality;  or  (iii)  that  becomes  available  to  Employee  on  a  non-confidential  basis  from  a
source that is legally entitled to disclose it to Employee.

8.4

Third Party Information. Employee understands and acknowledges that the Company has received, and in the future
will  receive,  from  third  parties,  their  confidential  or  proprietary  information  subject  to  a  duty  to  maintain  the
confidentiality  of  such  information  and  to  use  it  only  for  certain  limited  purposes.  At  all  times  during  Employee’s
employment with the Company, whether pursuant to this Agreement or at-will, and at all times thereafter, Employee
shall  hold  any  and  all  such  third  party  confidential  or  proprietary  information  of  third  parties  in  the  strictest
confidence and will not intentionally or negligently disclose it to any person or entity or to use it except as necessary
in  carrying  out  Employee’s  duties  and  obligations  hereunder  consistent  with  the  Company’s  agreement  with  such
third party. Employee shall not be in violation of Employee’s obligations hereunder if such third party confidential or
proprietary information is already

4

generally known to the public through no wrongful act of Employee or any other party.

8.5

Acknowledgement of Ownership of Confidential Information Property Acquired or Developed During Employment;
Non-Transfer.  Employee  understands,  agrees,  and  hereby  confirms  that  Employee’s  duties  and  responsibilities
include  acquiring  Confidential  Information  and  developing  Relationships  for  the  benefit  of  Company  and,  as
applicable,  the  Company.  Employee  acknowledges  that  Confidential  Information  acquired,  obtained,  learned,  or
developed during Employee’s employment with Company, including but not limited to, Business Contacts developed
during Employee’s employment, constitutes the sole and exclusive property of Company, regardless of whether the
information qualifies for protection as a Trade Secret.

Employee further understands, agrees, and hereby confirms that during Employee’s employment, Employee shall not,
at  any  time  or  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  except  upon  the  express  written  authorization  of  the  Company,  store,
transfer,  maintain,  copy,  duplicate  or  otherwise  possess  Confidential  Information  on  any  device  or  in  any  form  or
format  except  on devices  and in such formats  as expressly  approved  and issued  by the  Company  to Employee.  By
way of example, and without limitation, Employee shall not text, copy, or otherwise transfer in any form or format
Confidential  Information  to  any  document,  paper,  computer,  tablet,  Blackberry,  cellular  phone,  personal  mobile
device,  iPhone,  iPad,  thumb  drive,  smart  phone  memory,  zip  drive  or  disk,  flash  drive,  external  drive  or  any  other
similar  device  used  for  storing  or  recording  data  of  any  kind  (the  “Devices”)  unless  such  Device  is  issued  by  the
Company to Employee, or unless such text, copy or transfer is expressly approved in writing by the Company before
Employee’s use of such Device.

8.6

8.7

Return  of  Confidential  Information.  Upon  termination  of  Employee’s  employment  for  any  reason  at  any  time,
Employee  shall  immediately  return  to  the  Company,  and  retain  no  copies  of,  any  all  Confidential  Information  in
Employee’s  possession  or  control.  If  any  Confidential  Information  is  recorded  or  saved  in  any  format  or  on  any
Devices,  Employee  shall  delete  the  Confidential  Information  and,  upon  Company’s  request,  allow  Company  to
inspect such Devices to confirm the deletion. Upon Company’s request, Employee shall allow Company reasonable
access to Employee’s  personal computers, email accounts, and Devices to confirm that Employee does not possess
any Confidential Information of Company in contravention of this Agreement.

Acknowledgement of Copyrights in and to Compilations of Confidential Information. Employee acknowledges that
Company owns copyrights in any and all compilations of Confidential Information in any tangible or electronic form
(including,  but  not  limited  to,  printed  lists,  handwritten  lists,  spreadsheets,  and  databases)  in  any  storage  media,
including,  but  not  limited  to,  Devices,  (collectively,  “Copyrighted  Works”).  Employee  further  acknowledges  that
unauthorized  copying,  distributing,  or  creating  derivative  works,  or  inducing  or  contributing  to  such  conduct  by
others,  based  on  such  Copyrighted  Works  constitutes  infringement  of  Company’s  copyrights  in  and  to  the
Copyrighted Works. Employee acknowledges that only the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the
Company are authorized to grant authorization to Employee to copy, distribute or create derivative works based on
the Copyrighted Works. Employee shall obtain any such authorization from Company in writing, in advance of any
copying, distribution or creation of derivative works by

5

Employee. Employee acknowledges that federal law provides for civil liability and criminal penalties for copyright
infringement.  Employee  agrees  not  to  challenge,  contest  or  dispute  Company’s  right,  title  and  interest  in  the
Copyrighted Works and waives any legal or equitable defense to infringement of such Copyrighted Works.

9.

Representations and Warranties. Employee hereby represents and warrants to Company, and hereby agrees with Company, as
follows:

9.1

9.2

9.3

9.4

9.5

9.6

A  portion  of  Employee’s  compensation  and  consideration  under  this  Agreement  is  (i)  Company’s  agreement  to
employ Employee; (ii) Employee’s agreement that the covenants contained in Sections 4 and 8 hereof are reasonable,
appropriate and suitable in their geographic scope, duration and content; (iii) Employee’s agreement that Employee
shall not, directly or indirectly, raise any issue of the reasonableness, appropriateness and suitability of the geographic
scope,  duration  or  content  of  such  covenants  and  agreements  in  any  proceeding  to  enforce  such  covenants  and
agreements;  (iv)  Employee’s  agreement  that  such  covenants  and  agreements  shall  survive  the  termination  of  this
Agreement, in accordance with their terms; and (v) the free and full assignability by Company of such covenants and
agreements upon a sale, reorganization or other transaction of any kind relating to the ownership and/or control of the
Company or its members or assigns.

The enforcement of any remedy under this Agreement will not prevent Employee from earning a livelihood, because
Employee’s past work history and abilities are such that Employee can reasonably expect to find work irrespective of
the covenants and agreements contained in Section 8 hereof.

The  covenants  and  agreements  stated  in  Sections  4,  6,  7,  and  8  hereof  are  essential  for  the  Company’s  reasonable
protection of its Trade Secrets, Business Contacts, and Confidential Information.

The Company has reasonably relied on Employee’s covenants, representations and agreements in this Agreement.

Employee  has  the  full  right,  power  and  authority  to  enter  into  this  Agreement  and  perform  Employee’s  duties  and
obligations  hereunder,  and  the  entering  into  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  by  Employee  will  not  violate  or
conflict with any arrangements or other agreements Employee may have or agreed to have with any other person or
entity.

Employee acknowledges that the Company has and will continue to invest substantial time and expense in developing
and protecting Confidential Information, all of which Employee expressly understands and agrees belongs solely and
exclusively to Company. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that because the Company has and will continue
to  invest  substantial  time  and  expense  in  developing  and  protecting  Confidential  Information,  that  any  loss  of  or
damage to the Company as a result of a breach or threatened breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in
Sections  4 and 8 hereof,  the  Company  will  suffer irreparable  harm.  Consequently, Employee covenants and agrees
that  any  violation  by  Employee  of  Sections  4  or  8  of  this  Agreement  shall  entitle  the  Company  to  immediate
injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of posting any bond or waiving any claim
for damages. Employee further covenants and agrees that Employee will not contest the

6

enforceability of such an injunction in any state or country in which such an injunction is not, itself, a violation of
law.

10.

Termination.

10.1

Employer’s  Good  Cause  Termination.  Employer  has  the  right  to  terminate  this  Agreement  at  any  time  during  the
Specified  Term  hereof  for  “Employer’s  Good  Cause”  (defined  below  in  Section  21).  Upon  any  such  termination,
Employer  shall  have  no  further  liability  or  obligations  whatsoever  to  Employee  under  this  Agreement  except  as
provided under Sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 below.

10.1.1 In the event Employer’s Good Cause termination is the result of Employee’s death during the Specified Term,
Employee’s  beneficiary  (as  designated  by  Employee  on  Employer’s  benefit  records)  shall  be  entitled  to

paid at regular payroll intervals.

10.1.2 In the event Employer’s Good Cause termination is the result of Employee’s “Disability” (defined below in
Section  21),  Employer  shall  pay  Employee  (or  Employee’s  beneficiary  in  the  event  of  Employee’s  death
during the period in which payments are being made) an amount equal to Employee’s salary for twelve (12)
months  following  Employee’s  termination,  such  amount  to  be  paid  at  regular  payroll  intervals,  net  of
payments  received  by  Employee  from  any  short  term  disability  policy  which  is  either  self-insured  by
Employer or the premiums of which were paid by Employer (and not charged as compensation to Employee).

10.2

Employer’s  No  Cause  Termination.  Employer  has  the  right  to  terminate  this  Agreement  on  written  notice  to
Employee  in  its  sole  discretion  for  any  cause  Employer  deems  sufficient  or  for  no  cause,  at  any  time  during  the
Specified  Term,  including  on  the  last  day  of  the  Specified  Term.  Subject  to  the  conditions  set  forth  below,
Employer’s sole liability to Employee upon such termination shall be as follows:

10.2.1 Employee  shall  receive  an  amount  equal  to:  (i)  Employee’s  annual  base  salary  and  (ii)  Target  Bonus  (the

upon  the  date  that  is  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  date  of  separation;  plus  any  earned  but  unpaid  discretionary
bonus  due  to  Employee,  payable  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Program.  In  addition,  Employee
shall receive a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times the cost of COBRA coverage for a period of twelve (12)
months  immediately  following  separation  (the  “COBRA  Payment”),  payable  in  twelve  (12)  monthly
installments commencing upon separation.

(a)

If  Employee  remains  employed  at-will  by  Employer  after  expiration  of  the  Specified  Term  and  is
thereafter  separated  during  the  Restrictive  Period  for  No  Cause,  employee  shall  receive  a  lump  sum
payment (less all applicable taxes) equal to Employee’s then-current annual base salary, payable upon
the date that is thirty (30) days after the date of separation.

10.2.2 Employee’s eligibility for the Severance Payment and COBRA Payment set forth in Section 10.2.1 shall be

expressly subject to, conditioned upon,

7

and in consideration of Employee’s execution, within twenty-one (21) days following the date of Employee’s
termination of employment (or such shorter time period as may be required by the Company consistent with
applicable law) and non-revocation of a release prepared by Employer and waiving and releasing Employer
and  the  Company,  their  parents,  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  and  their  officers,  directors,  agents,  benefit  plan
trustees and employees, from any and all claims whether known or unknown, and regardless of type, cause or
nature,  including  but  not  limited  to  claims  arising  under  any  and  all  express  or  implied  employment
agreements,  any  and  all  statutory  and  common  law  tort  claims,  any  and  all  salary,  bonus,  stock,  vacation
(PTO), insurance and other benefit plans, and all state and federal laws, ordinances and statutes applicable to
Employee’s  employment  or  the  cessation  of  that  employment  that  may  be  released  by  private  agreement
(including but not limited to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Age Discrimination in
Employment  Act  as  amended  by  the  Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act  of  1990;  the  Americans  with
Disabilities  Act,  as  amended;  the  Equal  Pay  Act;  the  Lily  Ledbetter  Fair  Pay  Act;  the  Family  and  Medical
Leave Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act;
Chapter  608,  Compensation,  Wages  and  Hours,  of  the  Nevada  Revised  Statutes;  Chapter  613,  Employment
Practices,  of  the  Nevada  Revised  Statutes;  the  Worker  Adjustment  Retraining  Notification  Act  (“WARN”);
Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, as Amended (42 U.S.C. §1981-1988); the National Labor Relations Act;
the  Labor  Management  Relations  Act;  any  other  federal,  state  or  local  law  prohibiting  employment
discrimination or otherwise regulating employment; which release becomes irrevocable in accordance with its
terms  (which,  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  will  occur  within  thirty  (30)  days  or  fewer  following  the  date  of
Employee’s termination of employment).

10.2.3 As a further condition to Employer’s obligations under Section 10.2.1 above, Employee agrees to cooperate
with Employer regarding matters on which Employee has worked, on a reasonable basis and at times mutually
convenient to both parties. Employee further agrees to fully cooperate with the Company in any ongoing or
future legal matters about which Employee has knowledge or information, or that concern Employee’s former
position with the Company.

10.2.4 Upon  any  such  termination,  Employee  shall  continue  to  be  bound  by  the  restrictions  in  Section  8  above;
provided, however, that if the reason for the termination is the elimination of Employee’s position, Employee
shall not be bound by Section 8.1 but will continue to be bound by all other restrictions in Section 8 above.
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  Employer’s  conditional  obligation  under  Section  10.2.1  to
pay Employee’s salary shall cease if Employee breaches in any material respect any of the covenants set forth
in Section 8 above; additionally, and without waiving any rights to other damages resulting from said breach,
Employer shall be entitled to recover any and all amounts already paid to Employee under Section 10.2.1.

10.3

Employee’s  Good  Cause  Termination.  Employee  may  terminate  this  Agreement  for  “Employee’s  Good  Cause”
(defined below in Section 21). Prior to any termination under this Section 10.3 being effective, Employee agrees to
give

8

Employer thirty (30) days’ advance written notice, within thirty (30) days of the initial event comprising Employee’s
Good Cause, specifying the facts and circumstances that comprise Employee’s Good Cause. During such thirty (30)
day period, Employer may either cure the breach (in which case Employee’s notice will be considered withdrawn and
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect) or declare that Employer disputes that Employee’s Good Cause
exists,  in  which  case  this  Agreement  will  continue  in  full  force  until  the  dispute  is  resolved  in  accordance  with
Section  12.  In  the  event  this  Agreement  is  terminated  under  this  Section  10.3,  subject  to  the  conditions  set  forth
below, Employer’s sole liability to Employee upon such termination shall be as follows:

10.3.1 Employee  shall  receive  an  amount  equal  to:  (i)  Employee’s  annual  base  salary  and  (ii)  Target  Bonus  (the
“Severance  Payment”),  less  all  applicable  taxes,  payable  in  twelve  (12)  monthly  installments  commencing

10.3.4 In the event of termination of this Agreement under this Section 10.3, the restrictions of Section 8.1 shall no

longer apply.

Employee’s No Cause Termination. In the event Employee terminates Employee’s employment under this Agreement
without cause, Employer will have no further liability or obligations whatsoever to Employee hereunder. Employer
will be entitled to all of Employer’s rights and remedies by reason of such termination, including without limitation,
the right to enforce the covenants and agreements contained in Section 8 and Employer’s right to recover damages.

Arbitration. Except  as  otherwise  provided  for  in  this  Agreement  and  in  Exhibit D to  this  Agreement  (which  constitutes  a
material provision of this Agreement), any controversy, dispute or claim directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach thereof, or arising out of or relating to the employment of Employee, or the termination thereof,
shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to Exhibit D.

by binding arbitration pursuant to Exhibit D. Unless and until the arbitration process for a Disputed Claim is finally resolved

Severability. If any section, provision, paragraph, phrase, word, and/or line (collectively, “Provision”) of this Agreement is
declared to be unenforceable, then this Agreement will be deemed retroactively modified to the extent necessary to render the
otherwise unenforceable Provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court or arbitrator declines to
modify this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any Provision of this Agreement shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining Provisions. This Section 13 does not limit the Company’s rights to seek
damages  or  such  additional  relief  as  may  be  allowed  by  law  and/or  equity  in  respect  to  any  breach  by  Employee  of  the
enforceable provisions of this Agreement.

14.

No Waiver of Breach or Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of Employee or Employer in exercising any right, power
or  remedy  hereunder  shall  operate  as  a  waiver  thereof  nor  shall  any  single  or  partial  exercise  of  any  such  right,  power  or
remedy

management and be approved by the Compensation Committee. No consent to any departure by Employee from any of the
terms  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  effective  unless  the  same  is  signed  by  a  duly  authorized  member  of  Employer’s  senior
management  and  is  approved  by  the  Compensation  Committee.  Any  such  waiver  or  consent  shall  be  effective  only  in  the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

Governing  Law.  The  laws  of  the  State  in  which  the  Employer’s  principal  place  of  business  is  located  shall  govern  the
validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement, and except for Disputed Claims and subject to the Arbitrations
provisions included herewith, exclusive jurisdiction over any claim with respect to this Agreement shall reside in the courts
of the State of Nevada.

Number and Gender. Where  the  context  of  this  Agreement  requires  the  singular  shall  mean  the  plural  and  vice  versa  and
references to males shall apply equally to females and vice versa.

Headings.  The  headings  in  this  Agreement  have  been  included  solely  for  convenience  of  reference  and  shall  not  be

Employer  may  assign  this  Agreement.  Without  limitation  of  the  foregoing,  Employee  expressly  agrees  that  Employer’s
successors,  affiliates  and  assigns  may  enforce  the  provisions  of  Section  8  above,  and  that  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  annual

1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  and  any  regulations  and  Treasury  guidance  promulgated  thereunder  (“Section
409A”). If Employer determines in good faith that any provision of this Agreement would cause Employee to incur
an additional tax, penalty, or interest under Section

13

409A, the Compensation Committee and Employee shall use reasonable efforts to reform such provision, if possible,
in a mutually agreeable fashion to maintain to the maximum extent practicable  the original intent of the applicable
provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A or causing the imposition of such additional tax, penalty,

23.3

For purposes of Section 409A, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a
right to a series of separate payments.

23.4 With  respect  to  any  reimbursement  of  Employee’s  expenses,  or  any  provision  of  in-kind  benefits  to  Employee,  as
specified under this Agreement, such reimbursement of expenses or provision of in-kind benefits shall be subject to
the following conditions: (1) the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in
one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in
any  other  taxable  year,  except  for  any  medical  reimbursement  arrangement  providing  for  the  reimbursement  of
expenses  referred  to  in  Section  105(b)  of  the  Code;  (2)  the  reimbursement  of  an  eligible  expense  shall  be  made
pursuant  to  Employer’s  reimbursement  policy  but  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  year  after  the  year  in  which  such
expense  was  incurred;  and  (3)  the  right  to  reimbursement  or  in-kind  benefits  shall  not  be  subject  to  liquidation  or
exchange for another benefit.

23.5

If  a  payment  obligation  under  this  Agreement  that  constitutes  a  payment  of  “deferred  compensation”  (as  defined
under  Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.409A-1(b)(1),  after  giving  effect  to  the  exemptions  in  Treasury  Regulation
Sections 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12)) arises on account of Employee’s separation from service while Employee is
a “specified employee” (as defined under Section 409A), any payment thereof that is scheduled to be paid within six
(6) months after such separation from service shall accrue without interest and shall be paid within 15 days after the
end  of  the  six-month  period  beginning  on  the  date  of  such  separation  from  service  or,  if  earlier,  within  15  days
following Employee’s death.

24.

Ownership of Intellectual Property. Employee expressly acknowledges that all trademarks, trade dress, copyrightable works,
patentable  inventions,  ideas,  new  or  novel  inventions,  concepts,  systems,  methods  of  operation,  improvements,  strategies,
techniques,  trade  secrets  including,  but  not  limited  to,  customers  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  customer  names,  contact
information, historical and/or theoretical play, or other information, and the right to market to such customers), data of any
type  or  nature  and  regardless  of  the  form  or  media,  as well  as all  materials  of  any  type  of  nature  that  comprise,  reflect  or
embody  any  of  the  foregoing  including,  without  limitation,  databases,  software,  artistic  works,  advertisements,  brochures,
marketing  plans,  customer  lists,  memoranda,  business  plans,  and  proposals  (collectively,  “Intellectual  Property”)  created,
conceived,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  otherwise  obtained,  in  whole  or  in  part  by  the  Employee  during  the  term  of
Employee’s  employment  by  Employer  shall  at  all  times  be  owned  by  Employer  (and  is  hereby  expressly  assigned  by
Employee to Employer) if the Intellectual Property: (a) was created, conceived, developed, or contributed to: (1) using

14

any of Employer’s property or resources; (2) on Employer’s premises; or (3) during Employee’s hours of employment; or (b)
relates to Employee’s employment by Employer, even though creation of such Intellectual Property was not within the scope
of Employee’s duties and responsibilities for which the Employer employs the Employee. All works of authorship created by
Employee within the scope of this provision shall be deemed works made for hire as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976,
17 U.S.C. § 101 To the extent such works are deemed not to be works of authorship, Employee hereby irrevocably assigns
(or authorizes Employer to act as Employee’s agent to assign) all right, title and interest in and to the copyrights in the works,
including, without limitation, right of attribution and all related moral rights, to the Employer. Employee further agrees that
any inventions and trade secrets covered by this provision shall be owned absolutely and exclusively by Employer, including
all patent rights throughout the world. Employee acknowledges that this provision provides Employer with rights greater than
provided  under  certain  applicable  laws  including,  without  limitation,  Nevada  Revised  Statutes  §  600.500.  Employee shall
promptly inform Employer about such patentable inventions and shall not disclose to any third parties any information about
the  inventions  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Employer.  Employee  agrees  to  execute  and  deliver  to  Employer,  upon
request, such documents as may be necessary for Employer to perfect its rights in any and all Intellectual Property covered
by this provision. To fulfill the intent of this paragraph, Employee irrevocably appoints Employer and Employer’s authorized
agents as his/her agent and attorney in fact to transfer, vest or confirm Employer’s rights and to execute and file any such
applications  and  to  do  all  other  lawful  acts  to  further  the  prosecution  and  issuance  of  letters,  patents  or  trademark  or
copyright registrations with the same legal force as if done by Employee, in all instances in which Employer is unable for any
reason to secure Employee’s personal signature. Employee shall not be entitled to any compensation or other consideration
for any Intellectual Property covered by this provision.

25.

Certain Protections.

25.1

Employee understands that nothing contained in this Agreement limits or otherwise prohibits Employee from filing a
charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state
or  local  governmental  agency  or  commission  (“Government  Agencies”).  Employee  further  understands  that  this
Agreement does not limit Employee’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate
in  any  investigation  or  proceeding  that  may  be  conducted  by  any  Government  Agency,  including  providing
documents or other information (subject to paragraph 26.2 below), without notice to the Employer. This Agreement
does not limit Employee’s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies.

25.2 Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, pursuant

to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Employer hereby advises Employee as follows:

(a)

An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law
for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  (i)  is  made  (a)  in  confidence  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government  official,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  or  to  an  attorney;  and  (b)  solely  for  the  purpose  of
reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other

15

document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and

(b)

An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of
law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information
in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal;
and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

26.

CARES Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief, and Economic Security Act (as may be amended or modified, the “CARES Act”) in connection with the Company
entering  into,  or  becoming  eligible  to  enter  into,  a  loan,  loan  guarantee  or  other  form  of  financial  assistance  with  the
Secretary of the Treasury or other governmental entity under the CARES Act, (i) Employee shall agree to such limitations or
reductions with respect to Employee’s compensation (including, without limitation, equity awards) or severance entitlements
from the Company that are required by any governmental entity to comply with the applicable provisions of the CARES Act;
and (ii) Employee’s compensation (including, without limitation, equity awards) and severance entitlements from Employer
may be limited or reduced by the Compensation Committee to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable provisions
of  the  CARES  Act.  To  the  extent  permitted  by  the  CARES  Act  or  other  applicable  related  law  or  agreement,  any  such
limitation  or  reduction  shall  be  made  in  good  faith  consultation  with  Employee.  No  limitation,  reduction  or  other
consequence of this Section 26 shall constitute Employee's Good Cause.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Employer and Employee have entered into this Agreement in Las Vegas, Nevada, as of the date first

2. Grant to Participant. The Company hereby grants to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this

Agreement, an award of ________ Restricted Stock Units. Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or this Agreement, (i) each
Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one (1) share of Stock upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Units, (ii) unless
and until the Restricted Stock Units have vested in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Participant shall not have any
right to delivery of the shares of Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Units or any other consideration in respect thereof and (iii)
each Restricted Stock Unit that vests shall be paid to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the date that the Restricted
Stock Unit vests or the date(s) set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, as applicable.

3. Terms and Conditions.

    3.1 Vesting Schedule. Subject to Section 3.2, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest as set forth in (i) through (iv) below,

subject to the Participant’s continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent on each of the dates specified in (i)
through (iv) below:

        (i) The first installment shall consist of twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted Stock

Units and shall vest on the first anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Vesting Date”).

        (ii) The second installment shall consist of twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted

Stock Units and shall vest on the first anniversary of the Initial Vesting Date.

        (iii) The third installment shall consist of twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Stock subject to the Restricted

Stock Units and shall vest on the second anniversary of the Initial Vesting Date.

within thirty (30) days following the date that the applicable installment vests.

Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited without any consideration; provided, however, that, (i) upon termination of employment by
the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause or by the Participant with Participant’s Good Cause, the Restricted Stock Units that

months from the date of termination of employment shall remain outstanding and be paid on the same schedule determined in
Section 3.1 herein, (ii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s Retirement, so long as the date of termination is at
least 6 months following the Effective Date, all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall remain outstanding and be paid on the same
schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein, and (iii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s death or Disability, all
unvested Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested and paid to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the
date of termination. Any continued vesting provided for in the preceding sentence shall immediately cease and unvested Restricted
Stock Units shall be forfeited in the event the Participant breaches any post-termination covenant with the Company or its affiliate in
an employment agreement or set forth in Section 3.10 below (after taking into account any applicable cure period).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Participant qualifies at the time of termination of employment for both a
termination of employment due to Retirement (determined without regard to the 90-day notice requirement) and a termination by the
Employer without Employer’s Good Cause, Participant shall be permitted to designate whether Participant’s employment is due to
Participant’s Retirement or by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause.

    3.3 Committee Discretion. The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser

portion, of the Participant’s unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. If so
accelerated, the Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee or an
applicable written agreement but the Committee will have no right to accelerate any payment under this Agreement if such
acceleration would cause this Agreement to fail to comply with Section 409A.

    3.4 Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents.

        (i)    Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock subject to Restricted Stock Units
until the Restricted Stock Units have vested and shares of Stock relating thereto have been issued and recorded on the records of the
Company or its transfer agent or registrars.

        (ii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Restricted Stock Unit shall accrue dividend equivalents with respect to
dividends that would otherwise be paid on the Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit during the period from the date of grant
to the date such Stock is delivered. Any such dividend equivalent shall be deemed reinvested in additional full and fractional
Restricted Stock Units immediately upon the related dividend’s payment date, based on the then-current Fair Market Value, and
shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Unit on which such dividend
equivalent is paid. Any fractional shares shall be paid in cash upon the vesting of such Restricted Share Units.

    3.5 Limits on Transferability. The Restricted Stock Units granted under this Agreement may be transferred solely to a trust

in which the Participant or the Participant’s spouse control the management of the assets. With respect to Restricted Stock Units, if
any, that have been transferred to a trust, references in this Agreement to vesting related to such Restricted Stock Units shall be
deemed to include such trust. Any transfer of Restricted Stock Units shall be

21

subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement and the transferee shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as if it were the Participant. No interest of the Participant under this Agreement shall be subject to attachment, execution,
garnishment, sequestration, the laws of bankruptcy or any other legal or equitable process.

    3.6 Adjustments. If there is any change in the Stock by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,

merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares of Stock, or any similar change affecting the Stock the
Committee will make appropriate and proportionate adjustments (including relating to the Stock, other securities, cash or other
consideration which may be acquired upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units) that it deems necessary to the number and class of
securities subject to the Restricted Stock Units and any other terms of this Agreement. Any adjustment so made shall be final and
binding upon the Participant.

    3.7 No Right to Continued Performance of Services. The grant of the Restricted Stock Units does not confer upon the

Participant any right to continue to be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or
Subsidiary) nor may it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any
Parent or Subsidiary) for which the Participant performs services to terminate the Participant’s employment at any time.

    3.8 Compliance With Law and Regulations. The grant and vesting of Restricted Stock Units and the obligation of the

Company to issue shares of Stock under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations,
including those related to disclosure of financial and other information to the Participant and to approvals by any government or
regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates for shares of Stock
prior to (A) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Stock may then be listed and (B) the completion of any
registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any rule or regulation of any government body which
the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

    3.9 Corporate Transaction. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or similar

transaction, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the applicable rules and regulations of any
governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Units, including without limitation the following (or any
combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of the Restricted Stock Units by the Company (if it is the surviving company or
corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its
parent of an award with substantially the same terms for the Restricted Stock Units; (iii) accelerated vesting with respect to the
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the occurrence of such event and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days
thereafter; and (iv) cancellation of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units for fair value (in the form of cash or its equivalent
(e.g., by check), other property or any combination thereof) as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and which value
may be zero (if the value of the underlying stock is zero), and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days thereafter.

3.10 Participant Covenants. The Participant acknowledges that, in the course of performing his or her responsibilities

to the Employer, the Participant will form relationships and become acquainted with Confidential Information. The Participant
further acknowledges that such relationships and the Confidential Information are valuable to the Employer, and the restrictions on
his or her future employment contained in this Section 3.10, if any, are reasonably necessary in order for the Employer to remain
competitive in its various businesses. In

22

consideration of the benefits provided under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the potential vesting continuation or
acceleration under Section 3.2 hereof), and in recognition of the Employer’s heightened need for protection from abuse of
relationships formed or Confidential Information garnered during the Participant’s employment with the Employer, Participant
hereby agrees to the following covenants as a condition of receipt of the benefits provided under this Agreement:

(i)     Non-Competition. During the entire Restrictive Period, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly be

employed by, provide consultation or other services to, engage in, participate in or otherwise be connected in any way with any
“Competitor” in any capacity that is the same, substantially the same or similar to the position or capacity (irrespective of title or
department) as that held at any time during Participant’s employment with the Company. During the entire Vesting Period, if the
Participant directly or indirectly becomes employed by, provides consultation or other services to, engages in, participates in or
otherwise becomes connected in any way with any “Competitor”, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.2 of this
Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding Restricted Stock Units will immediately
terminate and be forfeited as of the date Participant becomes employed by or otherwise associated in any way with a Competitor.

(ii)    Non-Solicitation. In addition, during the Restrictive Period under this Section 3.10: (A) the Participant

will not call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any
Business Contacts of Employer, and (B) the Participant will not approach, solicit, contract with or hire any current Business Contacts
of Employer or entice any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or end his/her employment with
Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, in each and every instance, such consent to be within Company’s sole and
absolute discretion. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant (x) calls on, solicits, induces to leave and/or takes away, or
attempts to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer or (y) approaches, solicits,
contracts with or hires any current Business Contacts of Employer or entices any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship
with Employer or end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, the continued vesting
provided for under Section 3.2 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding
Restricted Stock Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date of such action.

(iii)    Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality. The Participant will not make known to any Competitor and/or any

member, manager, officer, director, employee or agent of a Competitor, the Business Contacts of Employer. The Participant further
covenants and agrees that at all times during Participant’s employment with the Company, and at all times thereafter, Participant
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel in each and every instance
—such consent to be within the Company’s sole and absolute discretion—use, disclose or make known to any person, entity or other
third party outside of the Employer any Confidential Information belonging to Employer or its individual members. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to Confidential Information: (A) that is required to be disclosed by law
or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) in any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or legislative hearing, with jurisdiction to order Participant to disclose or make accessible any information,
provided, however, that Participant provides Company with ten (10) days’ advance written notice of such disclosure to enable
Company to seek a protective order or other relief to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information; (B) that becomes
generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Participant’s or any third party’s violation of
this Section 3.10 or other obligation of confidentiality; or (C) that becomes available to Participant on a non-confidential basis from
a source that is legally entitled to disclose it to Participant.

23

(iv)    Forfeiture. It is a condition to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement that, in the event of any

breach of the Participant’s obligations under this Section 3.10, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.2 of this
Agreement will immediately terminate and all of the Participant’s then outstanding Restricted Stock Units will immediately
terminate and be forfeited as of the date the Company determines that such a breach has occurred.

Nothing contained in this Section 3.10 limits or otherwise prohibits the Participant from filing a charge or complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government
Agencies”). Further, this Section 3.10 does not limit the Participant’s ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or
otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including providing
documents or other information (subject to the paragraph below), without notice to the Company. This Section 3.10 does not limit
the Participant’s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.10 or otherwise, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the
Company hereby advises the Participant as follows: (A) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal
or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (a) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government
official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (b) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under
seal; and (B) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose
the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files
any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

The Participant agrees to notify the Company immediately of any other persons or entities for whom he or she works or provide
services within the Vesting Period (excluding occasional consulting services for a non-Competitor, and similar activities), and to
provide such information as the Company may reasonably request regarding such work or services during the Vesting Period within
a reasonable time following such request. If the Participant fails to provide such notice or information, which failure is not cured by
you within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the Company, any right to continued vesting under Section 3.2 shall
immediately cease. The Participant further agrees to promptly notify the Company, within the Vesting Period, of any contacts made
by any Competitor which concern or relate to an offer to employ the Participant or for the Participant to provide consulting or other
services during the Vesting Period.

4. Investment Representation. The Participant must, within five (5) days of demand by the Company furnish the Company an

agreement satisfactory to the Company in which the Participant represents that the shares of Stock acquired upon vesting are being
acquired for investment. The Company will have the right, at its election, to place legends on the certificates representing the shares
of Stock so being issued with respect to limitations on transferability imposed by federal and/or state laws, and the Company will
have the right to issue “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent.

5. Participant Bound by Plan. The Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by

all the terms and provisions thereof as amended from time to time.

24

6. Withholding. The Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold, any

applicable withholding taxes in respect of the Restarted Stock Units awarded by this Agreement, their grant, vesting or otherwise,
and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such
withholding taxes, which may include, without limitation, reducing the number of shares otherwise distributable to the Participant by
the number of shares of Stock whose Fair Market Value is equal to the amount of tax required to be withheld by the Company or a
Parent or Subsidiary as a result of the vesting or settlement or otherwise of the Restricted Stock Units.

7. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company must be addressed to: MGM Resorts International, 3600 Las Vegas

Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109, Attention: 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan Administrator, and any notice hereunder to
the Participant must be addressed to the Participant at the Participant’s last address on the records of the Company, subject to the
right of either party to designate at any time hereafter in writing some other address. Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly
given on personal delivery or three (3) days after being sent in a properly sealed envelope, addressed as set forth above, and
deposited (with first class postage prepaid) in the United States mail.

8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with regard to
the subject matter hereof and shall supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and
whether express or implied, and including, without limitation, any employment agreement between the Participant and the Company
or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) whether previously entered into, currently effective or
entered into in the future that includes terms and conditions regarding equity awards) which relate to the subject matter hereof.

9. Waiver. No waiver of any breach or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any other or subsequent

breach or condition whether of like or different nature.

10. Participant Undertaking. The Participant agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional
documents the Company may deem necessary or advisable to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions
imposed on either the Participant or the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement.

11. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the
Company and its successors and assigns and upon the Participant, the Participant’s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and
legatees of the Participant’s estate, whether or not any such person shall have become a party to this Agreement and agreed in
writing to be joined herein and be bound by the terms hereof.

12. Governing Law. The parties hereto agree that the validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement shall be

governed by the laws of the state of Nevada.

13. Arbitration. Except as otherwise provided in Exhibit A to this Agreement (which constitutes a material provision of this

Agreement), disputes relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Exhibit A hereto.

14. Clawback Policy. By accepting this award the Participant hereby agrees that this award and any other compensation paid

or payable to the Participant is subject to Company’s Policy on Recovery of Incentive Compensation in Event of Financial
Restatement (or any successor policy) as in effect from time to time, and that this award shall be considered a bonus for purposes of
such policy. In addition, the Participant agrees that such policy may be amended from time to time by the Board in a manner
designed to comply with applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements. The Participant also hereby agrees that the
award granted

25

hereunder and any other compensation payable to the Participant shall be subject to recovery (in whole or in part) by the Company to
the minimum extent required by applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements.

15. Amendment. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the

parties hereto; provided that the Company may alter, modify or amend this Agreement unilaterally if such change is not materially
adverse to the Participant or to cause this Agreement to comply with applicable law.

16. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any portion of this Agreement is declared contrary to

any law, regulation or is otherwise invalid, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless be
binding and enforceable.

17. Execution. Each party agrees that an electronic, facsimile or digital signature or an online acceptance or acknowledgment

will be accorded the full legal force and effect of a handwritten signature under Nevada law. This Agreement may be signed in
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.

18. Variation of Pronouns. All pronouns and any variations thereof contained herein shall be deemed to refer to masculine,

feminine, neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the person or persons may require.

19. Tax Treatment; Section 409A. The Participant shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to the Restricted Stock Units.

Notwithstanding the forgoing or any provision of the Plan or this Agreement:

    19.1 The parties agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under
Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan contravenes Section 409A or could cause the Participant to incur any
tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and without the Participant’s consent, modify
such provision in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy the conditions of any exception therefrom, or
otherwise to avoid the imposition of the additional income tax and interest under Section 409A, while maintaining, to the maximum
extent practicable, the original intent and economic benefit to the Participant, without materially increasing the cost to the Company,
of the applicable provision. However, the Company makes no guarantee regarding the tax treatment of the Restricted Stock Units
and none of the Company, its Parent, Subsidiaries or affiliates, nor any of their employees or representatives shall have any liability
to the Participant with respect thereto.

    19.2 A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement

providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A upon or
following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section
409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like
terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a “specified employee”
within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit
that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such
payment or benefit shall be made or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period
measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the Participant, and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death (the “Delay
Period”). Upon the

26

expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 19.2 (whether they would have otherwise
been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed on the first business day
following the expiration of the Delay Period to the Participant in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under
this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.

    19.3 For purposes of Section 409A, the Participant’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a
payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of
termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.

20. CARES Act. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms of Section 27

(CARES Act) of the Current Employment Agreement, which terms shall be incorporated herein by reference.

The promises by the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide
consideration for each other, in addition to other consideration provided under the Agreement.

2.    Claims Subject to Arbitration. This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only
claims that are justiciable under applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and all alleged
violations of any state or federal law whether common law, statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law,
brought by any current or former employees.

3.    Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights. This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or
common law. However, it does waive Participant’s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By signing the
Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A, the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to arbitrate his or her
claims covered by this Exhibit A.

4.    Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration; Initiation: To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiate
arbitration within the statute of limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim. The failure to
initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such claim. The parties understand that the Company and Participant are
waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party is encouraged to give written notice
of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly. The
parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a claim pursuant
to Section 7 of the Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall provide a copy of
such notice of a claim to the Company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall identify and describe
the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.

5.    Selecting an Arbitrator: This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Service (JAMS) regarding employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced
in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one arbitrator from
among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, each party
shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected.

6.    Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures:

        a.    Participant may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.

    b.    The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its

choice of law provisions) and/or federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the broadest level of
arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under Nevada or applicable federal law. The arbitrator is without
jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.

    c.    The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is

specifically authorized by an applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the
award the specific statute or other basis under which such relief is granted.

    d.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to

compromise must be followed.

    e.    The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and
to subpoena and/or request copies of records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural
rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct
of any hearing and/or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to entertain a motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary
judgment.

    f.    The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure. The arbitrator shall have

subpoena power so that either Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the Federal Rules of
Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief. Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a
court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.

    g.    Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

7.    Arbitrator’s Award: The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific
findings of fact, and the specific conclusions of law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion
of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or remedy in
excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on both parties. Judgment
upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

        a.    Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A

and to enforce an arbitration award.

        b.    In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf of
Participant which is subject to arbitration under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or
other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action, and Participant’s sole remedy with respect to any such
claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.

8.    Fees and Expenses: The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator;
provided, however, that if Participant is the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to
initiate a claim in the court

30

of general jurisdiction in the state in which Participant is (or was last) employed by the Company. Participant and the Company shall
each pay for their own expenses, attorney’s fees (a party’s responsibility for his/her/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any
applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy), and costs and fees regarding witness,
photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney’s
fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable
attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the
claim(s).

9.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant’s employment with the Company and the
expiration of the Agreement. These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by both parties and
which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the provisions of this Exhibit A.

10.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement.

11.    Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the same definition as in the Agreement to which this is Exhibit A.

12.    If any provision of this Exhibit A is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication
shall not affect the validity of the remainder of Exhibit A. All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

EXHIBIT D: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

This  Arbitration  Agreement  is  entered  into  as  of  June  [3],  2021  (the  “Effective  Date”),  by  and  between MGM  Resorts
International, its affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, divisions, successors, assigns and their current and former members, employees,
officers, directors, and agents (hereafter  collectively  referred to as the “Employer”)  and Tilak Mandadi  on behalf of him/herself,
his/her heirs, administrators, executors, successors and assigns (“Employee”).

By signing this Agreement, both Employee and Employer (collectively the “Parties”) affirmatively assent and are specifically
authorizing  the resolution  of the covered claims (as set forth below) by final and binding  arbitration  per the terms of this
Agreement,  rather  than  litigation  before  a  judge  and/or  jury  in  court.  The  Parties  acknowledge  that  by  agreeing  to
arbitration, they are WAIVING ANY RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.

A.    Scope of the Arbitration Agreement: Claims Covered and Not Covered.

       1.        Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Arbitration  Agreement,  Employee  and  Employer  agree  to  resolve  through  final  and
binding arbitration any and all claims, disputes, or controversies that could otherwise be filed in court (“Claims”), whether legal or
equitable, that Employee or Employer may have against each other. Claims covered by the Arbitration Agreement include, but are
not limited to, those arising out of or relating to Employee’s obligations under the Employment Agreement, dated as of the Effective
Date, by and between Employee and Employer (“employment Agreement”), as well as those arising out of or relating to Employee’s
application  for  employment,  the  employment  relationship,  and  Employee’s  separation  from  employment;  Title  VII  of  the  Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (as amended);  the Fair Labor Standards  Act; the Equal Pay Act; the Family and Medical Leave Act; the Age
Discrimination  in  Employment  Act;  the  Genetic  Information  and  Nondisclosure  Act;  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act;  the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”); the Fair Credit Reporting Act; Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title
42  of  the  United  States  Code;  the  Pregnancy  Discrimination  Act;  the  Rehabilitation  Act;  the  Worker  Adjustment  and  Retraining
Notification  Act;  any  other  federal,  state,  or  local  law,  ordinance  or  regulation  relating  to  the  employment  relationship  between
Employee and Employer, including, but not limited to, the payment of wage of any kind or based on any public policy, contract, tort,
or  common  law;  or  any  claim  for  damages,  costs,  fees,  or  other  expenses  or  legal  or  equitable  relief,  including  attorneys’  fees.
Moreover,  and  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  below,  it  is  the  Parties’  clear  and  unmistakable  intent  that  all  Claims  be
resolved  through  binding  arbitration  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  federal  law  (and  state  law  that  is  not  preempted  by  federal
law), not an administrative proceeding or court.

    2.    Certain claims are not covered by this Arbitration Agreement: (i) claims for workers' compensation benefits; (ii) claims for
unemployment  compensation  benefits;  (iii)  claims  which  by  federal  law  may  not  be  subject  to  mandatory  binding  pre-dispute
arbitration, such as certain claims under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act; (iv) claims against a federal contractor that may
not be the subject of a pre-dispute arbitration agreement as provided by valid, applicable, and enforceable federal Executive Orders
and their implementing rules, regulations, and guidance; (v) claims asserted on an individual basis alleging quid pro quo or hostile
work environment sexual harassment, and sex discrimination claims based on sexually harassing conduct under federal and state law
(but  excluding  claims  of  sexual  harassment  and  sex  discrimination  asserted  on  a  class  or  representative  basis,  and  excluding  sex
discrimination

C-1

pay equity claims); and, (vi) claims under employee pension, welfare benefit or stock option plans if those plans provide a dispute
resolution procedure.

    3.    Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement, Employee understands and agrees that
failure  to  abide  by  Employee’s  promises  under  the  Employment  Agreement  would  impair  Employer’s  essential  ongoing  business
plans  and  financial  arrangements  and  would  cause  Employer  irreparable  harm.  As  such,  Employee  understands  and  agrees  that
Employer  may  apply  to  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  temporary,  preliminary,  or  emergency  injunctive  relief  in  the  event
Employer  believes  in  good  faith  that  Employee  has  breached  such  promises.  This  Arbitration  Agreement  also  does  not  prohibit
Employee  or  the  Employer  from  filing  a  motion  in  court  to  compel  arbitration.  This  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  prohibit
Employee  from  filing  administrative  charges  with  a  federal,  state,  or  local  administrative  agency  such  as  the  National  Labor
Relations  Board  (NLRB),  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC),  or  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  nor  does
anything in this Arbitration Agreement preclude, prohibit, or otherwise limit, in any way, Employee’s rights and abilities to contact,
communicate with, report matters to, or otherwise participate in any whistleblower program administered by any such agencies.

B.    Class/Collective Action Waiver.

Except  where  prohibited  by  federal  law,  covered  claims  must  be  brought  on  an  individual  basis  only.  The  parties  agree  that  by
signing  this  Arbitration  Agreement,  they  waive  their  right  to  commence,  or  be  a  party  to,  any  class,  collective,  representative,  or
multi-plaintiff claims. The parties agree any claim can be pursued, but only on an individual basis, except the lack of co-plaintiffs
shall  not,  in  and  of  itself,  be  a  bar  to  pursuit  of  a  pattern  and  practice  claim.  Any  disputes  concerning  the  validity  of  this  multi-
plaintiff, class, collective, and representative action waiver will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, not by the arbitrator.
In the event a court determines that this waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim or portion of a claim, this waiver shall not
apply to that claim or portion of the claim, which may then only proceed in court as the exclusive forum.

C.     Authority to Determine Arbitrability.

Except  as  expressly  provided  for  above,  the  arbitrator  shall  have  the  exclusive  authority  to  resolve  any  dispute  relating  to  the
enforceability  or  formation  of  this  Arbitration  Agreement  (including  all  defenses  to  contract  enforcement  such  as,  for  example,
waiver and unconscionability) or the arbitrability of any claim. Enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement may not be precluded on
the grounds that (1) a party to this Arbitration Agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third
party  arising  out  of  the  same  transaction  or  series  of  related  transactions,  or  (2)  a  party  to  this  Arbitration  Agreement  asserts
arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims

C-2

D.    The Arbitration Process.

1.    This Arbitration Agreement is governed by and shall be enforced pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”).
The  arbitration  will  be  heard  by  a  neutral  arbitrator  and  will  be  administered  by  the  Judicial  Arbitration  Mediation  Service
(“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules (“JAMS Rules”). A copy of the JAMS Rules may be obtained from
the  Employer  or  downloaded  from  JAMS  (www.jamsadr.com)  or  by  calling  JAMS  at  1(800)352-5267.  To  the  extent  any  of  the
provisions in this Arbitration Agreement conflict with the JAMS Rules or any other rules of JAMS, this Arbitration Agreement shall
prevail. The parties may agree upon an individual arbitrator to hear the case or follow the JAMS Rules relating to selection of an
arbitrator. The  arbitrator  shall  have  the  power  to  award  any  type  of  legal  or  equitable  relief  on  an  individual  basis  that  would  be
available in a court of competent jurisdiction including, but not limited to, costs (except as provided for in Section E.3 below) and
attorneys’  fees,  to  the  extent  available  under  applicable  law. The  arbitrator  must  issue  a  written  award  and  decision.  Any arbitral
award may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction, as permitted by and in accordance with the FAA.

2.    The party initiating an arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to JAMS within the statute of limitations
applicable to the claims asserted in the demand for arbitration. Any claim for arbitration will be timely only if brought within the
statute of limitations applicable to the claim or claims in the demand. Within the same time frame, the party initiating the arbitration
also should send a copy of the demand for arbitration to the other party. Employer will send demands for arbitration to Employee at
the address the Employer has on file for Employee.

3.    Employer agrees to bear JAMS filing fees and administrative costs, as well as the cost of the arbitrator, including the
arbitrator’s  travel  expenses,  if  any,  and  will  reimburse  Employee  for  any  fees  Employee  may  be  required  to  pay  for  filing  the
demand for arbitration. The parties each shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs (if any) relating to any arbitration proceeding
itself, except as part of any remedy that may be awarded, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award the parties his, her, or its
attorneys’ fees and costs where required or permitted by law or by operation of law pursuant to an offer of judgment.

4.    The arbitration will take place in the city and state in which Employee is employed or was last employed by Employer.
In adjudicating the claim(s), the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the state in which Employee is employed or was last
employed  by Employer  or the state  in which  the claim(s)  arose. Each  party  shall  have  the  right  to  conduct  discovery  adequate  to
fully and fairly present the claims and defenses consistent with the streamlined nature of arbitration.

5.        If  for  whatever  reason  JAMS  declines  to  act  as  the  neutral,  the  parties  shall  utilize  NAM  (www.namadr.com)  as  the
neutral for the arbitration/appeal and shall utilize its Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes. Each party agrees that it has had
an opportunity to review the current JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.

E.    Consideration For This Arbitration Agreement.

The Parties agree that new or continued employment, the Employer’s agreement to pay all fees and costs including JAMS filing fees
and  administrative  costs,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  the  arbitrator,  and  the  mutual  promises  to  arbitrate  the  claims  covered  by  this
Arbitration Agreement serve as adequate consideration.

F.    Severability and Related Issues.

C-3

If any provision or portion of a provision is found to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the provision or portion of the provision
shall  be interpreted  in  a manner  or  modified  to  make  it enforceable.  If that  is not possible,  it shall be severed,  and the remaining
portions of the provisions  and other provisions  of this Arbitration  Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect.  Neither JAMS
(defined below) nor the arbitrator shall have power under this Arbitration Agreement to modify or alter this Arbitration Agreement
so as to permit the arbitrator or JAMS to consolidate claims and/or to hear a multi-plaintiff, class, collective, or representative action.

G.    Other Provisions of this Arbitration Agreement.

This Arbitration Agreement contains the complete agreement between the parties regarding the subjects covered in it and supersedes
any  prior  or  inconsistent  agreements  that  might  exist  between  Employee  and  Employer  as  to  the  subjects  addressed  herein.  This
Arbitration  Agreement  can  be  modified  only  by  an  express  written  agreement  signed  by  Employee  and  an  authorized  Legal
Representative for Employer. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment.

Neither  the  terms  nor  conditions  described  in  this  Arbitration  Agreement  are  intended  to  create  a  contract  of  employment  for  a
specific  duration  of time. Employment  with  the Employer  is voluntarily  entered  into,  and  Employee  is free  to resign  at any time.
Similarly, the Employer may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason, with or without prior notice.

BY ISSUANCE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE EMPLOYER AGREES TO BE BOUND TO ITS TERMS
WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENT TO SIGN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

I  KNOWINGLY  AGREE  TO  THIS  MUTUAL  AGREEMENT  TO  ARBITRATE  CLAIMS,  WHICH  OTHERWISE
COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN COURT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH
MAY  BE  ENFORCED  IN  COURT,  REQUIRES  THAT  CLAIMS  COVERED  BY  THIS  ARBITRATION  AGREEMENT
BE  SUBMITTED  TO  ARBITRATION  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  ARBITRATION  AGREEMENT  RATHER  TO  A  JUDGE
OR  JURY  IN  COURT.  I  AFFIRM  THAT  I  HAVE  HAD  SUFFICIENT  TIME  TO  READ  AND  UNDERSTAND  THE
TERMS  OF  THIS  ARBITRATION  AGREEMENT  AND  THAT  I  HAVE  BEEN  ADVISED  OF  MY  RIGHT  TO  SEEK
LEGAL COUNSEL REGARDING THE MEANING AND EFFECT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PRIOR TO
SIGNING.

3.3 Termination of Service. Upon termination of employment (or other service) with the Employer for any reason on or prior to the last day of the

Vesting Period, the Performance Share Units shall be forfeited without any consideration; provided, however, that, (i) upon termination of employment by the
Employer without Employer’s Good Cause or by the Participant with Participant’s Good Cause, a pro-rata portion of the Performance Share Units, if any, that
would have become vested (but for such termination) under the schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein, shall vest, such proration determined based on the
number of days Participant was employed during the Vesting Period plus an additional twelve (12) months (or, if shorter, through the end of the Vesting Period
Period), and, together with any Dividend Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid on the same schedule determined in
Section 3.2 herein, (ii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s Retirement, so long as the date of termination is at least 6 months following the

in Section 3.1 herein, shall vest, such proration determined based on the number of days Participant was employed during the Vesting Period, and, together with
any Dividend Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid on the same schedule determined in Section 3.2 herein, and (iii) upon

the event the Participant breaches any post-termination covenant with the Company or its affiliate in an employment agreement or set forth in Section 3.11 below
(after taking into account any applicable cure period).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Participant qualifies at the time of termination of employment for both a termination of employment due to
Retirement (determined without regard to the 90-day notice requirement) and a termination by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause, Participant shall be
permitted to designate whether Participant’s employment is due to Participant’s Retirement or by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause.

3.4 Committee Discretion. The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the Target Award up to the maximum amount described in

Section 3.1 above, at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement and Section 409A. If so accelerated, the Performance Share Units will be
considered as having

5

vested as of the date specified by the Committee or an applicable written agreement, but the Committee will have no right to accelerate any payment under this
Agreement if such acceleration would cause this Agreement to fail to comply with, or give rise to any tax, penalty or interest under, Section 409A.

3.5 Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents.

Share Units have vested and Shares relating thereto have been issued and recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agent or registrars.

A.

Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to Performance Share Units until the Performance

B.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this award shall accrue dividend equivalents with respect to dividends that would otherwise be paid on

the Shares underlying the award during the period from the date of grant to the date such Performance Share Unit is earned and the underlying Shares delivered.
On each dividend payment date during such period, the award shall accrue a target number of dividend equivalents equal to (A) the sum of (i) the number of
Performance Share Units subject to the Target Award, plus (ii) the number of dividend equivalents previously accrued, multiplied by (B) the applicable per-share
dividend amount and divided by (C) the then-current Fair Market Value. The dividend equivalent shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other
conditions applicable to the Performance Share Units on which such dividend equivalents are accrued. As such, the determination of the number of dividend
equivalents which vest and are payable pursuant to the award shall be determined as the product of (a) the sum of all dividend equivalents determined in
accordance with this Section 3.5(ii) and (b) a fraction equal to (i) the number of Performance Share Units which vest in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement divided by (ii) the number of Performance Share Units subject to the Target Award.

3.6 Limits on Transferability. The Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be transferred solely to a trust in which the

Participant or the Participant’s spouse control the management of the assets. With respect to Performance Share Units, if any, that have been transferred to a trust,
references in this Agreement to vesting related to such Performance Share Units shall be deemed to include such trust. Any transfer of Performance Share Units
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement and the transferee shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as if it were the
Participant. No interest of the Participant under this Agreement shall be subject to attachment, execution, garnishment, sequestration, the laws of bankruptcy or any
other legal or equitable process.

3.7 Adjustments. If there is any change in the Shares by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-
up, combination or exchange of Shares, or any similar change affecting the Shares the Committee will make appropriate and proportionate adjustments (including
relating to the Shares, other securities, cash or other consideration which may be acquired upon vesting of the Performance Share Units) that it deems necessary to
the number and class of securities subject to the Performance Share Units and any other terms of this Agreement. Any adjustment so made shall be final and
binding upon the Participant.

3.8 No Right to Continued Performance of Services. The grant of the Performance Share Units does not confer upon the Participant any right to

continue to be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) nor may it interfere in any way with the
right of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) for which the Participant performs services to terminate the
Participant’s employment at any time.

3.9 Compliance With Law and Regulations. The grant and vesting of Performance Share Units and the obligation of the Company to issue Shares

under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including those related to disclosure of financial and other
information to the Participant and to approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver
any certificates for Shares prior to (A) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Shares may then be listed and (B) the completion of any
registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any rule or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

3.10 Corporate Transaction. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or similar transaction, unless otherwise
specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the applicable rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges,
the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Performance Share Units, including without limitation the
following (or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of the Performance Share Units by the Company (if it is the surviving company or
corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of an award with
substantially the same terms for the Performance Share Units; (iii) accelerated vesting with respect to the Performance Share Units immediately prior to the
occurrence of such event and payment to the Participant within

6

thirty (30) days thereafter; and (iv) cancellation of all or any portion of the Performance Share Units for fair value (in the form of cash or its equivalent (e.g., by
check), other property or any combination thereof) as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and which value may be zero (if the value of the
underlying stock is zero), and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days thereafter.

3.11 Participant Covenants. The Participant acknowledges that, in the course of performing his or her responsibilities to the Employer, the Participant

will form relationships and become acquainted with Confidential Information. The Participant further acknowledges that such relationships and the Confidential
Information are valuable to the Employer, and the restrictions on his or her future employment contained in this Section 3.11, if any, are reasonably necessary in
order for the Employer to remain competitive in its various businesses. In consideration of the benefits provided under this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, the potential vesting continuation or acceleration under Section 3.3 hereof), and in recognition of the Employer’s heightened need for protection from abuse of
relationships formed or Confidential Information garnered during the Participant’s employment with the Employer, Participant hereby agrees to the following
covenants as a condition of receipt of the benefits provided under this Agreement:

A.

Non-Competition. During the entire Restrictive Period, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly be employed by, provide

consultation or other services to, engage in, participate in or otherwise be connected in any way with any “Competitor” in any capacity that is the same,
substantially the same or similar to the position or capacity (irrespective of title or department) as that held at any time during Participant’s employment with the
Company. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant directly or indirectly becomes employed by, provides consultation or other services to, engages in,
participates in or otherwise becomes connected in any way with any “Competitor”, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will
immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date Participant
becomes employed by or otherwise associated in any way with a Competitor.

B.

Non-Solicitation. In addition, during the Restrictive Period under this Section 3.11: (A) the Participant will not call on, solicit, induce to

leave and/or take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer, and (B) the Participant will not
approach, solicit, contract with or hire any current Business Contacts of Employer or entice any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or
end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, in each and every instance, such consent to be within Company’s sole and
absolute discretion. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant (x) calls on, solicits, induces to leave and/or takes away, or attempts to call on, solicit,
induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer or (y) approaches, solicits, contracts with or hires any current Business Contacts of Employer
or entices any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of
Company, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding
Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date of such action.

C.

Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality. The Participant will not make known to any Competitor and/or any member, manager, officer,

director, employee or agent of a Competitor, the Business Contacts of Employer. The Participant further covenants and agrees that at all times during Participant’s
employment with the Company, and at all times thereafter, Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer or General Counsel in each and every instance—such consent to be within the Company’s sole and absolute discretion—use, disclose or make
known to any person, entity or other third party outside of the Employer any Confidential Information belonging to Employer or its individual members.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to Confidential Information: (A) that is required to be disclosed by law or by any
court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or legislative hearing,
with jurisdiction to order Participant to disclose or make accessible any information, provided, however, that Participant provides Company with ten (10) days’
advance written notice of such disclosure to enable Company to seek a protective order or other relief to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information; (B) that becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Participant’s or any third party’s violation of
this Section 3.11 or other obligation of confidentiality; or (C) that becomes available to Participant on a non-confidential basis from a source that is legally entitled
to disclose it to Participant.

D.

Forfeiture. It is a condition to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement that, in the event of any breach of the Participant’s

obligations under this Section 3.11, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of the Participant’s
then outstanding Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date the Company determines that such a breach has occurred.

7

Nothing contained in this Section 3.11 limits or otherwise prohibits the Participant from filing a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). Further, this Section 3.11 does not limit the Participant’s ability to
communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency,
including providing documents or other information (subject to the paragraph below), without notice to the Company. This Section 3.11 does not limit the
Participant’s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.11 or otherwise, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Company hereby advises the
Participant as follows: (A) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (i) is made (a) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (b) solely for the purpose of
reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made
under seal; and (B) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal;
and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
The Participant agrees to notify the Company immediately of any other persons or entities for whom he or she works or provide services within the Vesting Period
(excluding occasional consulting services for a non-Competitor, and similar activities), and to provide such information as the Company may reasonably request
regarding such work or services during the Vesting Period within a reasonable time following such request. If the Participant fails to provide such notice or
information, which failure is not cured by you within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the Company, any right to continued vesting under Section
3.3 shall immediately cease. The Participant further agrees to promptly notify the Company, within the Vesting Period, of any contacts made by any Competitor
which concern or relate to an offer to employ the Participant or for the Participant to provide consulting or other services during the Vesting Period.

4. Investment Representation. The Participant must, within five (5) days of demand by the Company furnish the Company an agreement satisfactory to the

Company in which the Participant represents that the Shares acquired upon vesting are being acquired for investment. The Company will have the right, at its
election, to place legends on the certificates representing the Shares so being issued with respect to limitations on transferability imposed by federal and/or state
laws, and the Company will have the right to issue “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent.

5. Participant Bound by Plan. The Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions

thereof as amended from time to time.

6. Withholding. The Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold, any applicable withholding taxes in
respect of the Performance Share Units awarded by this Agreement, their grant, vesting or otherwise, and to take such other action as may be necessary in the
opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes, which may include, without limitation, reducing the number of shares
otherwise distributable to the Participant by the number of Shares whose Fair Market Value is equal to the amount of tax required to be withheld by the Company
or a Parent or Subsidiary as a result of the vesting or settlement or otherwise of the Performance Share Units.

7. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company must be addressed to: MGM Resorts International, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada
89109, Attention: 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan Administrator, and any notice hereunder to the Participant must be addressed to the Participant at the Participant’s

deemed to have been duly given on personal delivery or three (3) days after being sent in a properly sealed envelope, addressed as set forth above, and deposited
(with first class postage prepaid) in the United States mail.

8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof and

shall supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied, and including, without limitation,
any employment agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) whether
previously entered into, currently effective or entered into in the future that includes terms and conditions regarding equity awards) which relate to the subject
matter hereof.

9. Waiver. No waiver of any breach or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or condition whether of like

or different nature.

time to time, and that this award shall be considered a bonus for purposes of such policy. In addition, the Participant agrees that such policy may be amended from
time to time by the Board in a manner designed to comply with applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements. The Participant also hereby agrees that
the award granted hereunder and any other compensation payable to the Participant shall be subject to recovery (in whole or in part) by the Company to the
minimum extent required by applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements.

15.

Amendment. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto; provided, that

the Company may alter, modify or amend this Agreement unilaterally if such change is not materially adverse to the Participant or to cause this Agreement to
comply with applicable law or avoid the imposition of any tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A.

19.

Tax Treatment; Section 409A. The Participant shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to the Performance Share Units. Notwithstanding the

forgoing or any provision of the Plan or this Agreement:

19.1 The parties agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan
contravenes Section 409A or could cause the Participant to incur any tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and
without the Participant’s consent, modify such provision in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy the conditions of any exception
therefrom, or otherwise to avoid the imposition of the additional income tax and interest under Section 409A, while maintaining, to the maximum extent
practicable, the original intent and economic benefit to the Participant, without materially increasing the cost to the Company, of the applicable provision.
However, the Company makes no guarantee regarding the tax treatment of the Performance Share Units and none of the Company, its Parent, Subsidiaries or
affiliates, nor any of their employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Participant with respect thereto.

19.2 A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment

of any amounts or benefits considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such
termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a
“termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a
“specified employee” within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is
considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such payment or benefit shall be made or
provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the
Participant, and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death (the “Delay Period”). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to
this Section 19.2 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed on
the first business day following the expiration of the Delay Period to the Participant in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this
Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.

19.3 For purposes of Section 409A, the Participant’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to
receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g.,
“payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole
discretion of the Company.

EXHIBIT A

ARBITRATION

This Exhibit A sets forth the methods for resolving disputes should any arise under the Agreement, and accordingly, this Exhibit A shall be considered a part

of the Agreement.

1.    Except for a claim by either Participant or the Company for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise authorized by law, any controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach hereof including without limitation any claim involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement
or the Plan, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the employment arbitration rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Service (“JAMS”), to the extent not inconsistent with this paragraph. This Exhibit A covers any claim Participant might have against any officer, director,
employee, or agent of the Company, or any of the Company’s subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, and all successors and assigns of any of them. The promises by
the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide consideration for each other, in addition to
other consideration provided under the Agreement.

2.    Claims Subject to Arbitration: This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only claims that are justiciable under
applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and all alleged violations of any state or federal law whether common law,
statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law, brought by any current or former employees.

3.    Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights: This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law. However, it does
waive Participant’s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By signing the Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A,
the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to arbitrate his or her claims covered by this Exhibit A.

4.    Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration; Initiation: To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiate arbitration within the statute of
limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim. The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such
claim. The parties understand that the Company and Participant are waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party
is encouraged to give written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly.
The parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a claim pursuant to Section 7 of the
Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall provide a copy of such notice of a claim to the Company’s Executive
Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall identify and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.

5.    Selecting an Arbitrator: This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) regarding
employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which
arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one arbitrator from among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to
agree on the arbitrator, each party shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected.

6.    Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures:

     a.    Participant may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.

     b.    The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its choice of law provisions) and/or
federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the broadest level of arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under
Nevada or applicable federal law. The arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.

     c.    The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is specifically authorized by an
applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such
relief is granted.

     d.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to compromise must be followed.

     e.    The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and to subpoena and/or request copies of
records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the
scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing and/or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to entertain a motion
to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment.

12

     f.    The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure. The arbitrator shall have subpoena power so that either
Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the Federal Rules of Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief.
Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.

     g.    Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

7.    Arbitrator’s Award: The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the
specific conclusions of

     law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if
requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision is final and
binding on both parties.. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

     a.    Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A and to enforce an arbitration award.

     b.    In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf of Participant which is subject to arbitration
under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action,
and Participant’s sole remedy with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.

8.    Fees and Expenses: The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator; provided, however, that if Participant is
the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which
Participant is (or was last) employed by the Company. Participant and the Company shall each pay for their own expenses, attorney’s fees (a party’s responsibility
for his/her/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy), and costs and
fees regarding witness, photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney’s fees and
costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing
party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim(s).

9.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant’s employment with the Company and the expiration of the Agreement.
These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by both parties and which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the
provisions of this Exhibit A.

10.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement.

11.    Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the same definition as in the Agreement to which this is Exhibit A.

12.    If any provision of this Exhibit A is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the
remainder of Exhibit A. All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Subject to Section 3.3 herein, a percentage of the Target Award shall vest at the end of the Vesting Period as set forth in the table below

based on the Company’s percentile rank of TSR against the Comparison Group over the Performance Period; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything

(iii)

If the Company’s percentile rank of TSR should fall between two of the percentiles set forth above, the percentage of the Target Award

without consideration.

(iv)

Any Performance Share Units that are not vested as of the last day of the Vesting Period shall immediately be forfeited and cancelled

3.2 Payment. Any Performance Share Units which vest in accordance with Section 3.1 (following application of Section 3.3), and any Dividend

Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid to the Participant in Shares, less applicable withholding taxes, within thirty (30) days
following the last day of the Vesting Period; provided, that any fractional Shares shall be paid in cash.

3.3 Termination of Service. Upon termination of employment (or other service) with the Employer for any reason on or prior to the last day of the

Vesting Period, the Performance Share Units shall be forfeited without any consideration; provided, however, that, (i) upon termination of employment by the
Employer without Employer’s Good Cause or by the Participant with Participant’s Good Cause, a pro-rata portion of the Performance Share Units, if any, that
would have become vested (but for such termination) under the schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein, shall vest, such proration determined based on the
number of days Participant was employed during the Vesting Period plus an additional twelve (12) months (or, if shorter, through the end of the Vesting Period),
and, together with any Dividend Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid on the same schedule determined in Section 3.2 herein,
(ii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s Retirement, so long as the date of termination is at least 6 months following the Effective Date, the
Performance Share Units, if any, that would have become vested (but for such termination) under the schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein, shall vest and,
together with any Dividend Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid on the same schedule determined in Section 3.2 herein, and
(iii) upon termination of employment due to the Participant’s death or Disability, the Performance Share Units, if any, that would have become vested under the
schedule determined in Section 3.1 herein if the Vesting Period ended on the date of termination (rather than the third anniversary of the Effective Date) shall vest,
and, together with any Dividend Equivalent Rights which vest as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be paid to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the
date of termination. Any continued vesting provided for in the preceding sentence shall immediately cease and unvested Performance Share Units shall be forfeited
in the event the Participant breaches any post-termination covenant with the Company or its affiliate in an employment agreement or set forth in Section 3.11
below (after taking into account any applicable cure period).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Participant qualifies at the time of termination of employment for both a termination of employment due to
Retirement (determined without regard to the 90-day notice requirement) and a termination by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause, Participant shall be
permitted to designate whether Participant’s employment is due to Participant’s Retirement or by the Employer without Employer’s Good Cause.

3.4 Committee Discretion. The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the Target Award up to the maximum amount described in

Section 3.1 above, at any time, subject to the terms of the Plan and

5

this Agreement and Section 409A. If so accelerated, the Performance Share Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Committee or
an applicable written agreement, but the Committee will have no right to accelerate any payment under this Agreement if such acceleration would cause this
Agreement to fail to comply with, or give rise to any tax, penalty or interest under, Section 409A.

3.5 Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents.

Share Units have vested and Shares relating thereto have been issued and recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agent or registrars.

A.

Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to Performance Share Units until the Performance

B.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this award shall accrue dividend equivalents with respect to dividends that would otherwise be paid on

the Shares underlying the award during the period from the date of grant to the date such Performance Share Unit is earned and the underlying Shares delivered.
On each dividend payment date during such period, the award shall accrue a target number of dividend equivalents equal to (A) the sum of (i) the number of
Performance Share Units subject to the Target Award, plus (ii) the number of dividend equivalents previously accrued, multiplied by (B) the applicable per-share
dividend amount and divided by (C) the then-current Fair Market Value. The dividend equivalent shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other
conditions applicable to the Performance Share Units on which such dividend equivalents are accrued. As such, the determination of the number of dividend
equivalents which vest and are payable pursuant to the award shall be determined as the product of (a) the sum of all dividend equivalents determined in
accordance with this Section 3.5(ii) and (b) a fraction equal to (i) the number of Performance Share Units which vest in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement divided by (ii) the number of Performance Share Units subject to the Target Award.

3.6 Limits on Transferability. The Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be transferred solely to a trust in which the

Participant or the Participant’s spouse control the management of the assets. With respect to Performance Share Units, if any, that have been transferred to a trust,
references in this Agreement to vesting related to such Performance Share Units shall be deemed to include such trust. Any transfer of Performance Share Units
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement and the transferee shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as if it were the
Participant. No interest of the Participant under this Agreement shall be subject to attachment, execution, garnishment, sequestration, the laws of bankruptcy or any
other legal or equitable process.

3.7 Adjustments. If there is any change in the Shares by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-
up, combination or exchange of Shares, or any similar change affecting the Shares the Committee will make appropriate and proportionate adjustments (including
relating to the Shares, other securities, cash or other consideration which may be acquired upon vesting of the Performance Share Units) that it deems necessary to
the number and class of securities subject to the Performance Share Units and any other terms of this Agreement. Any adjustment so made shall be final and
binding upon the Participant.

3.8 No Right to Continued Performance of Services. The grant of the Performance Share Units does not confer upon the Participant any right to

continue to be employed by the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) nor may it interfere in any way with the
right of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) for which the Participant performs services to terminate the
Participant’s employment at any time.

3.9 Compliance With Law and Regulations. The grant and vesting of Performance Share Units and the obligation of the Company to issue Shares

under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including those related to disclosure of financial and other
information to the Participant and to approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver
any certificates for Shares prior to (A) the listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Shares may then be listed and (B) the completion of any
registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law, or any rule or regulation of any government body which the Company shall, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

3.10 Corporate Transaction. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or similar transaction, unless otherwise
specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the applicable rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges,
the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Performance Share Units, including without limitation the
following (or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of the Performance Share Units by the Company (if it is the surviving company or
corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of an award with
substantially the same terms for the Performance Share Units; (iii) accelerated vesting with respect to the

6

Performance Share Units immediately prior to the occurrence of such event and payment to the Participant within thirty (30) days thereafter; and (iv) cancellation
of all or any portion of the Performance Share Units for fair value (in the form of cash or its equivalent (e.g., by check), other property or any combination thereof)
as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee and which value may be zero (if the value of the underlying stock is zero), and payment to the Participant
within thirty (30) days thereafter.

3.11 Participant Covenants. The Participant acknowledges that, in the course of performing his or her responsibilities to the Employer, the Participant

will form relationships and become acquainted with Confidential Information. The Participant further acknowledges that such relationships and the Confidential
Information are valuable to the Employer, and the restrictions on his or her future employment contained in this Section 3.11, if any, are reasonably necessary in
order for the Employer to remain competitive in its various businesses. In consideration of the benefits provided under this Agreement (including, but not limited
to, the potential vesting continuation or acceleration under Section 3.3 hereof), and in recognition of the Employer’s heightened need for protection from abuse of
relationships formed or Confidential Information garnered during the Participant’s employment with the Employer, Participant hereby agrees to the following
covenants as a condition of receipt of the benefits provided under this Agreement:

A.

Non-Competition. During the entire Restrictive Period, the Participant shall not directly or indirectly be employed by, provide

consultation or other services to, engage in, participate in or otherwise be connected in any way with any “Competitor” in any capacity that is the same,
substantially the same or similar to the position or capacity (irrespective of title or department) as that held at any time during Participant’s employment with the
Company. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant directly or indirectly becomes employed by, provides consultation or other services to, engages in,
participates in or otherwise becomes connected in any way with any “Competitor”, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will
immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date Participant
becomes employed by or otherwise associated in any way with a Competitor.

B.

Non-Solicitation. In addition, during the Restrictive Period under this Section 3.11: (A) the Participant will not call on, solicit, induce to

leave and/or take away, or attempt to call on, solicit, induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer, and (B) the Participant will not
approach, solicit, contract with or hire any current Business Contacts of Employer or entice any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or
end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of Company, in each and every instance, such consent to be within Company’s sole and
absolute discretion. During the entire Vesting Period, if the Participant (x) calls on, solicits, induces to leave and/or takes away, or attempts to call on, solicit,
induce to leave and/or take away, any Business Contacts of Employer or (y) approaches, solicits, contracts with or hires any current Business Contacts of Employer
or entices any Business Contact to cease his/her/its relationship with Employer or end his/her employment with Employer, without the prior written consent of
Company, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of such Participant’s then outstanding
Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date of such action.

C.

Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality. The Participant will not make known to any Competitor and/or any member, manager, officer,

director, employee or agent of a Competitor, the Business Contacts of Employer. The Participant further covenants and agrees that at all times during Participant’s
employment with the Company, and at all times thereafter, Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer or General Counsel in each and every instance—such consent to be within the Company’s sole and absolute discretion—use, disclose or make
known to any person, entity or other third party outside of the Employer any Confidential Information belonging to Employer or its individual members.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to Confidential Information: (A) that is required to be disclosed by law or by any
court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or legislative hearing,
with jurisdiction to order Participant to disclose or make accessible any information, provided, however, that Participant provides Company with ten (10) days’
advance written notice of such disclosure to enable Company to seek a protective order or other relief to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information; (B) that becomes generally known to the public or within the relevant trade or industry other than due to Participant’s or any third party’s violation of
this Section 3.11 or other obligation of confidentiality; or (C) that becomes available to Participant on a non-confidential basis from a source that is legally entitled
to disclose it to Participant.

D.

Forfeiture. It is a condition to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement that, in the event of any breach of the Participant’s

obligations under this Section 3.11, the continued vesting provided for under Section 3.3 of this Agreement will immediately terminate and all of the Participant’s
then outstanding Performance Share Units will immediately terminate and be forfeited as of the date the Company determines that such a breach has occurred.

7

Nothing contained in this Section 3.11 limits or otherwise prohibits the Participant from filing a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). Further, this Section 3.11 does not limit the Participant’s ability to
communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency,
including providing documents or other information (subject to the paragraph below), without notice to the Company. This Section 3.11 does not limit the
Participant’s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.11 or otherwise, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Company hereby advises the
Participant as follows: (A) an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret
that (i) is made (a) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (b) solely for the purpose of
reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made
under seal; and (B) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the
attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal;
and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
The Participant agrees to notify the Company immediately of any other persons or entities for whom he or she works or provide services within the Vesting Period
(excluding occasional consulting services for a non-Competitor, and similar activities), and to provide such information as the Company may reasonably request
regarding such work or services during the Vesting Period within a reasonable time following such request. If the Participant fails to provide such notice or
information, which failure is not cured by you within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the Company, any right to continued vesting under Section
3.3 shall immediately cease. The Participant further agrees to promptly notify the Company, within the Vesting Period, of any contacts made by any Competitor
which concern or relate to an offer to employ the Participant or for the Participant to provide consulting or other services during the Vesting Period.

4. Investment Representation. The Participant must, within five (5) days of demand by the Company furnish the Company an agreement satisfactory to the

Company in which the Participant represents that the Shares acquired upon vesting are being acquired for investment. The Company will have the right, at its
election, to place legends on the certificates representing the Shares so being issued with respect to limitations on transferability imposed by federal and/or state
laws, and the Company will have the right to issue “stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent.

5. Participant Bound by Plan. The Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions

thereof as amended from time to time.

6. Withholding. The Company or any Parent or Subsidiary shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold, any applicable withholding taxes in
respect of the Performance Share Units awarded by this Agreement, their grant, vesting or otherwise, and to take such other action as may be necessary in the
opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes, which may include, without limitation, reducing the number of shares
otherwise distributable to the Participant by the number of Shares whose Fair Market Value is equal to the amount of tax required to be withheld by the Company
or a Parent or Subsidiary as a result of the vesting or settlement or otherwise of the Performance Share Units.

7. Notices. Any notice hereunder to the Company must be addressed to: MGM Resorts International, 3600 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada
89109, Attention: 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan Administrator, and any notice hereunder to the Participant must be addressed to the Participant at the Participant’s
last address on the records of the Company, subject to the right of either party to designate at any time hereafter in writing some other address. Any notice shall be
deemed to have been duly given on personal delivery or three (3) days after being sent in a properly sealed envelope, addressed as set forth above, and deposited
(with first class postage prepaid) in the United States mail.

8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof and

shall supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied, and including, without limitation,
any employment agreement between the Participant and the Company or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Parent or Subsidiary) whether
previously entered into, currently effective or entered into in the future that includes terms and conditions regarding equity awards) which relate to the subject
matter hereof.

8

9. Waiver. No waiver of any breach or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or condition whether of like

or different nature.

10.

Participant Undertaking. The Participant agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional documents the Company may

deem necessary or advisable to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions imposed on either the Participant or the Performance Share Units
pursuant to this Agreement.

11.

Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and its successors and

assigns and upon the Participant, the Participant’s assigns and the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of the Participant’s estate, whether or not any such
person shall have become a party to this Agreement and agreed in writing to be joined herein and be bound by the terms hereof.

12.
state of Nevada.

Governing Law. The parties hereto agree that the validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the

13.

Arbitration. Except as otherwise provided in Exhibit A to this Agreement (which constitutes a material provision of this Agreement), disputes

relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Exhibit A hereto.

14.

Clawback Policy. By accepting this award the Participant hereby agrees that this award and any other compensation paid or payable to the

Participant is subject to Company’s Policy on Recovery of Incentive Compensation in Event of Financial Restatement (or any successor policy) as in effect from
time to time, and that this award shall be considered a bonus for purposes of such policy. In addition, the Participant agrees that such policy may be amended from
time to time by the Board in a manner designed to comply with applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements. The Participant also hereby agrees that
the award granted hereunder and any other compensation payable to the Participant shall be subject to recovery (in whole or in part) by the Company to the
minimum extent required by applicable law and/or stock exchange listing requirements.

15.

Amendment. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto; provided, that

the Company may alter, modify or amend this Agreement unilaterally if such change is not materially adverse to the Participant or to cause this Agreement to
comply with applicable law or avoid the imposition of any tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A.

16.

Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any portion of this Agreement is declared contrary to any law, regulation or is

otherwise invalid, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.

17.

Execution. Each party agrees that an electronic, facsimile or digital signature or an online acceptance or acknowledgment will be accorded the

18.

Variation of Pronouns.. All pronouns and any variations thereof contained herein shall be deemed to refer to masculine, feminine, neuter,

singular or plural, as the identity of the person or persons may require.

19.

Tax Treatment; Section 409A. The Participant shall be responsible for all taxes with respect to the Performance Share Units. Notwithstanding the

forgoing or any provision of the Plan or this Agreement:

19.1 The parties agree that this Agreement shall be interpreted to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, and all provisions of this Agreement
shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A. If any provision of this Agreement or the Plan
contravenes Section 409A or could cause the Participant to incur any tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A, the Committee may, in its sole discretion and
without the Participant’s consent, modify such provision in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy the conditions of any exception
therefrom, or otherwise to avoid the imposition of the additional income tax and interest under Section 409A, while maintaining, to the maximum extent
practicable, the original intent and economic benefit to the Participant, without materially increasing the cost to the Company, of the applicable provision.
However, the Company makes no guarantee regarding the tax treatment of the Performance Share Units and none of the Company, its Parent, Subsidiaries or
affiliates, nor any of their employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Participant with respect thereto.

9

19.2 A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment

of any amounts or benefits considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such
termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a
“termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.” If the Participant is deemed on the date of termination to be a
“specified employee” within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is
considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such payment or benefit shall be made or
provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such “separation from service” of the
Participant, and (ii) the date of the Participant’s death (the “Delay Period”). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to
this Section 19.2 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed on
the first business day following the expiration of the Delay Period to the Participant in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this
Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.

19.3 For purposes of Section 409A, the Participant’s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to
receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g.,
“payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole
discretion of the Company.

EXHIBIT A

ARBITRATION

This Exhibit A sets forth the methods for resolving disputes should any arise under the Agreement, and accordingly, this Exhibit A shall be considered a part

of the Agreement.

1.    Except for a claim by either Participant or the Company for injunctive relief where such would be otherwise authorized by law, any controversy or claim
arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach hereof including without limitation any claim involving the interpretation or application of the Agreement
or the Plan, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the employment arbitration rules then in effect of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Service (“JAMS”), to the extent not inconsistent with this paragraph. This Exhibit A covers any claim Participant might have against any officer, director,
employee, or agent of the Company, or any of the Company’s subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates, and all successors and assigns of any of them. The promises by
the Company and Participant to arbitrate differences, rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies, provide consideration for each other, in addition to
other consideration provided under the Agreement.

2.    Claims Subject to Arbitration: This Exhibit A contemplates mandatory arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. Only claims that are justiciable under
applicable state or federal law are covered by this Exhibit A. Such claims include any and all alleged violations of any state or federal law whether common law,
statutory, arising under regulation or ordinance, or any other law, brought by any current or former employees.

3.    Non-Waiver of Substantive Rights: This Exhibit A does not waive any rights or remedies available under applicable statutes or common law. However, it does
waive Participant’s right to pursue those rights and remedies in a judicial forum. By signing the Agreement and the acknowledgment at the end of this Exhibit A,
the undersigned Participant voluntarily agrees to arbitrate his or her claims covered by this Exhibit A.

4.    Time Limit to Pursue Arbitration; Initiation: To ensure timely resolution of disputes, Participant and the Company must initiate arbitration within the statute of
limitations (deadline for filing) provided for by applicable law pertaining to the claim. The failure to initiate arbitration within this time limit will bar any such
claim. The parties understand that the Company and Participant are waiving any longer statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply, and any aggrieved party
is encouraged to give written notice of any claim as soon as possible after the event(s) in dispute so that arbitration of any differences may take place promptly.
The parties agree that the aggrieved party must, within the time frame provided by this Exhibit A, give written notice of a claim pursuant to Section 7 of the
Agreement. In the event such notice is to be provided to the Company, the Participant shall provide a copy of such notice of a claim to the Company’s Executive
Vice President and General Counsel. Written notice shall identify and describe the nature of the claim, the supporting facts and the relief or remedy sought.

5.    Selecting an Arbitrator: This Exhibit A mandates Arbitration under the then current rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) regarding
employment disputes. The arbitrator shall be either a retired judge or an attorney experienced in employment law and licensed to practice in the state in which
arbitration is convened. The parties shall select one arbitrator from among a list of three qualified neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS. If the parties are unable to
agree on the arbitrator, each party shall strike one name and the remaining named arbitrator shall be selected.

6.    Representation/Arbitration Rights and Procedures:

     a.    Participant may be represented by an attorney of his/her choice at his/her own expense.

     b.    The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Nevada (without regard to its choice of law provisions) and/or
federal law when applicable. In all cases, this Exhibit A shall provide for the broadest level of arbitration of claims between the Company and Participant under
Nevada or applicable federal law. The arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or law of remedies.

     c.    The arbitrator shall have no authority to award non-economic damages or punitive damages except where such relief is specifically authorized by an
applicable state or federal statute or common law. In such a situation, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the specific statute or other basis under which such
relief is granted.

     d.    The applicable law with respect to privilege, including attorney-client privilege, work product, and offers to compromise must be followed.

     e.    The parties shall have the right to conduct reasonable discovery, including written and oral (deposition) discovery and to subpoena and/or request copies of
records, documents and other relevant discoverable information consistent with the procedural rules of JAMS. The arbitrator shall decide disputes regarding the
scope of discovery and shall have authority to regulate the conduct of any hearing and/or trial proceeding. The arbitrator shall have the right to entertain a motion
to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment.

12

     f.    The parties shall exchange witness lists at least 30 days prior to the trial/hearing procedure. The arbitrator shall have subpoena power so that either
Participant or the Company may summon witnesses. The arbitrator shall use the Federal Rules of Evidence. Both parties have the right to file a post hearing brief.
Any party, at its own expense, may arrange for and pay the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings.

     g.    Any arbitration hearing or proceeding shall take place in private, not open to the public, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

7.    Arbitrator’s Award: The arbitrator shall issue a written decision containing the specific issues raised by the parties, the specific findings of fact, and the
specific conclusions of

     law. The award shall be rendered promptly, typically within 30 days after conclusion of the arbitration hearing, or the submission of post-hearing briefs if
requested. The arbitrator may not award any relief or remedy in excess of what a court could grant under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision is final and
binding on both parties.. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

     a.    Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Exhibit A and to enforce an arbitration award.

     b.    In the event of any administrative or judicial action by any agency or third party to adjudicate a claim on behalf of Participant which is subject to arbitration
under this Exhibit A, Participant hereby waives the right to participate in any monetary or other recovery obtained by such agency or third party in any such action,
and Participant’s sole remedy with respect to any such claim shall be any award decreed by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of this Exhibit A.

8.    Fees and Expenses: The Company shall be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator; provided, however, that if Participant is
the party initiating the claim, Participant will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which
Participant is (or was last) employed by the Company. Participant and the Company shall each pay for their own expenses, attorney’s fees (a party’s responsibility
for his/her/its own attorney’s fees is only limited by any applicable statute specifically providing that attorney’s fees may be awarded as a remedy), and costs and
fees regarding witness, photocopying and other preparation expenses. If any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorney’s fees and
costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorney’s fees and/or costs, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and/or costs to the prevailing
party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim(s).

9.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A shall survive the termination of Participant’s employment with the Company and the expiration of the Agreement.
These arbitration provisions can only be modified or revoked in a writing signed by both parties and which expressly states an intent to modify or revoke the
provisions of this Exhibit A.

10.    The arbitration provisions of this Exhibit A do not alter or affect the termination provisions of this Agreement.

11.    Capitalized terms not defined in this Exhibit A shall have the same definition as in the Agreement to which this is Exhibit A.

12.    If any provision of this Exhibit A is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the
remainder of Exhibit A. All other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

13

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

BOTH PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT: THEY HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS EXHIBIT A IN ITS ENTIRETY, THEY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS,
EXHIBIT A CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL TERM AND CONDITION OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES
TO WHICH IT IS EXHIBIT A, AND THEY AGREE TO ABIDE BY ITS TERMS.

The parties also specifically acknowledge that by agreeing to the terms of this Exhibit A, they are waiving the right to pursue claims covered by this Exhibit A in a
judicial forum and instead agree to arbitrate all such claims before an arbitrator without a court or jury. It is specifically understood that this Exhibit A does not
waive any rights or remedies which are available under applicable state and federal statutes or common law. Both parties enter into this Exhibit A voluntarily and
not in reliance on any promises or representation by the other party other than those contained in the Agreement or in this Exhibit A.

Participant further acknowledges that Participant has been given the opportunity to discuss this Exhibit A with Participant’s private legal counsel and that
Participant has availed himself/herself of that opportunity to the extent Participant wishes to do so.

DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION AND LICENSING

Exhibit 99.1

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject
to extensive regulation under the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws and regulations generally concern the responsibility,
financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could
result  in  disciplinary  action  in  other  jurisdictions.  Any  material  changes,  new  laws  or  regulations,  or  material  differences  in  interpretations  by  courts  or
governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.

In addition to gaming regulations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which we
operate. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters,
employment  and  immigration,  currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  land  use,  marketing  and  advertising,  lending,  privacy,  telemarketing,
regulations  applicable  under  the  Office  of  Foreign  Asset  Control,  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  the  various  reporting  and  anti-money  laundering
regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any material
changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating
results.

Gaming Regulation Overview

In the jurisdictions in which we operate, gaming laws and regulations require, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures;

the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum internal control procedures for
internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;

reliable record keeping and the filing of periodic reports with our gaming regulators;

the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices;

the qualification,  licensing  or registration  of certain employees,  vendors and other persons with a financial interest  in or control or influence  over
gaming operations;

the payment of gaming taxes, licensing fees and other regulatory fees;

• maintenance of responsible gaming programs; and

•

compliance with community benefits agreements in our host and surrounding communities, where applicable.

Typically,  regulatory environments  in the jurisdictions  in which we operate are established by legislation  and are administered  by a regulatory agency or
agencies  with  the  authority  to  interpret  their  gaming  enabling  legislation  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder  and  have  broad  discretion  and  authority  to
regulate  the affairs  of owners, managers,  and persons  with financial  interests  in gaming operations.  Gaming regulators  in the various  jurisdictions  in which we
operate, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

adopt regulations under their gaming enabling legislation;

investigate and enforce gaming laws and regulations;

impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;

review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;

grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;

collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;

review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants, securities offerings and debt
transactions engaged in by such participants; and

establish and collect taxes and fees.

Any changes in the laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of a gaming jurisdiction in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business

and operating results.

Licensing, Suitability and Qualification Determinations

Gaming laws and regulations require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some
cases, certain of our shareholders and holders of our debt securities, to obtain licenses or findings of suitability or qualification from gaming regulators. Licenses or
findings  of  suitability  or  qualification  typically  require  a  determination  that  the  applicant  satisfies  specific  criteria  set  forth  in  the  applicable  gaming  laws  and
regulations. Gaming regulators have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable or qualified. Subject
to certain administrative proceeding requirements, gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any
license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed
reasonable  by  the  gaming  regulator.  The  criteria  used  in  determining  whether  to  grant  or  renew  a  license  or  finding  of  suitability  or  qualification  vary  from
jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction but generally include such factors as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant;

the  financial  stability,  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the  applicant,  including  whether  the  gaming  operation  in  the  jurisdiction  is  adequately
capitalized to pay winning wagers as and when due, meet ongoing operating expenses, pay all local, state and federal taxes as and when due, make
necessary capital and maintenance expenditures in a timely manner, and make all long-term and short-term debt payments and satisfy capital lease
obligations as and when due;
the quality of the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;

the total amount of the investment in the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;

the effect on competition and the general impact on the host and surrounding communities;

the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable jurisdiction through the operation of the applicant’s gaming facility; and

the applicant’s practices with respect to minority and local hiring and training of its workforce.

In evaluating individual applicants, gaming regulators consider, among other things, the individual’s good character, honesty and integrity, financial stability,

criminal and financial history, and the character of those with whom the individual associates.

Many  jurisdictions  limit  the  number  of  licenses  granted  to  operate  gaming  facilities  within  the  jurisdiction,  and  some  jurisdictions  limit  the  number  of
licenses granted to any one gaming operator. For example, in Maryland, state law allows us to hold an interest in only one video lottery operation. Licenses under
gaming laws are generally not transferable, although some jurisdictions permit a transfer with the prior approval of the jurisdiction’s gaming regulator(s). Licenses
in  many  of  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  conduct  gaming  operations  are  granted  for  limited  durations  and  require  renewal  from  time  to  time.  There  can  be  no
assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed.

A gaming license is generally a revocable privilege. Many jurisdictions have statutory or regulatory provisions that govern the required action that may be
taken  in  the  event  that  a  license  is  revoked  or  not  renewed.  For  example,  under  New  Jersey  gaming  laws,  a  conservator  may  be  appointed  by  the  New  Jersey
Casino  Control  Commission  (“NJCCC”)  to  assume  complete  operational  control  of  the  casino  and  the  approved  hotel  facility  upon  the  revocation  of  a  casino
license, and the conservator may, at the direction of the NJCCC and after appropriate prior consultation with the former licensee as to the reasonableness of such
terms  and  conditions,  endeavor  to  and  be  authorized  to  sell,  assign,  convey  or  otherwise  dispose  of  in  bulk,  subject  to  any  and  all  valid  liens,  claims,  and
encumbrances, all the property of a former licensee relating to the casino and the approved hotel.

In addition to us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming regulators may investigate any individual or entity having a
material relationship to, or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business
associate of a gaming licensee. Certain jurisdictions require that any change in our directors or officers, including the directors or officers of our subsidiaries, must
be approved by the requisite gaming regulator(s). Our officers, directors and certain key employees must also file applications with gaming regulators and may be
required  to  be  licensed  or  be  found  suitable  or  qualified  in  many  jurisdictions.  Gaming  regulators  have  broad  discretion  to  deny  an  application  for  licensing.
Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough background investigation.
The applicant has the burden of demonstrating suitability or qualification for licensure, and the applicant ordinarily must pay all the costs of the investigation. In
addition to a gaming regulator’s authority to deny an application

2

for licensure or a finding of suitability or qualification, gaming regulators also generally have the authority to condition or limit licensure or a finding of suitability
or qualification, or disapprove of a change in an individual’s corporate position.

If  a  gaming  regulator  finds  that  an  officer,  director  or  key  employee  fails  to  qualify  or  is  unsuitable  for  licensing  or  unsuitable  to  continue  having  a
relationship  with  us,  we  would  ordinarily  have  to  sever  all  relationships  with  such  person.  In  addition,  gaming  regulators  may  require  us  to  terminate  the
employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.

In many jurisdictions, any of our shareholders or holders of our debt securities may be required to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have his,
her or its suitability determined. For example, under Nevada gaming laws, any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned,
may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if either the Nevada
Gaming Commission (the “NGC”) has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada, or
the  person  engages  in  certain  statutorily  proscribed  activities  which  influence  or  affect  the  affairs  of  a  holding  company  of  a  Nevada  gaming  licensee.  The
applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the NGC and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (“NGCB”) in conducting any such investigation.

Furthermore,  any person required  by a gaming regulator to be found suitable,  who is found unsuitable  by the gaming regulator,  shall not be able to hold
directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security or any debt security of any
public corporation which is registered with the gaming regulator (or otherwise subject to a finding of suitability or qualification as holding company of a gaming
licensee),  such as MGM Resorts International,  beyond the  time  prescribed  by the  gaming regulator.  A finding  of unsuitability  by a particular  gaming  regulator
impacts  that  person’s  ability  to  associate  or  affiliate  with  gaming  licensees  in  that  particular  jurisdiction  and  could  impact  the  person’s  ability  to  associate  or
affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions.

Many  jurisdictions  also  require  any  person  who  acquires  beneficial  ownership  of  more  than  a  certain  percentage  of  our  voting  securities  and,  in  some
jurisdictions, our non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming regulators, and gaming regulators may require such holders to apply for
qualification or a finding of suitability. For example, Nevada gaming laws require any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to
report the acquisition to the NGC. Additionally, Nevada gaming laws require that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to
the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chair of the NGCB mails the written notice requiring such filing.

However, many jurisdictions permit an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver that allows the “institutional investor” to acquire, in many cases, up to
15% of our voting securities without applying for qualification or a finding of suitability. The gaming laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction typically
define who may be considered an “institutional investor,” and typically provide particular categories of persons who may be considered such an investor, e.g., a
retirement fund administered by a public agency for the exclusive benefit of federal, state, or local public employees; investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.); licensed life insurance company or property and casualty insurance company; banking and other
chartered or licensed lending institution; and investment advisor registered under The Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80b-1 et seq.). Additionally, a
person satisfying the applicable “institutional investor” definition must also generally have acquired and hold the securities in the ordinary course of business as an
institutional investor, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors, any change in
our  corporate  charter,  bylaws,  management,  policies  or  operations,  or  those  of  any  of  our  gaming  affiliates,  or  the  taking  of  any  other  action  which  gaming
regulators find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. An application for a waiver as an institutional investor generally
requires the submission of detailed information about the company and its regulatory filings, the name of each person that beneficially owns more than 5% of the
institutional investor’s securities or other equivalent and a certification made under oath or penalty for perjury, that the securities were acquired and are held for
investment purposes only. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was
granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations. A change in the investment intent of an institutional investor
must be reported to certain gaming regulators immediately if such investment intent changes.

Generally, any person who beneficially owns our voting securities and fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or qualification within the time
prescribed by applicable law after being ordered to do so, or who refuses or fails to cooperate with any regulatory investigation or fails to pay the investigative
costs incurred in connection with investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable or not qualified. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the
record  owner,  after  request,  fails  to  identify  the  beneficial  owner.  Any  security  holder  found  unsuitable  and  who  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  beneficial
ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming regulators may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will
be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our
subsidiaries, we or any of our subsidiaries:

•

•

•

•

pay that person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;

allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;

pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchase
of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

Gaming  regulators  may,  either  as  required  by  applicable  law  or  in  their  discretion,  also  require  the  holder  of  any  debt  security  to  file  an  application,  be
investigated, and be found suitable or qualified to hold the debt security. In such cases, some jurisdictions permit the holder to seek an institutional investor waiver
in accordance with applicable law. If a gaming regulator determines that a person is unsuitable or not qualified to own the debt security, the gaming regulator may,
either  as  required  by  applicable  law  or  in  its  discretion,  limit  the  ability  of  the  issuer  to  pay  any  dividend,  interest,  or  any other distribution whatsoever to the
unsuitable or not qualified person.

Many  jurisdictions  also  require  that  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  gaming  equipment  and  suppliers  of  certain  goods  and  services  to  gaming  industry
participants  be  registered  or  licensed  and  require  us  to  purchase  and  lease  gaming  equipment,  supplies  and  services  only  from  properly  registered  or  licensed
suppliers.

Additionally, the ability of a lender to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with applicable gaming laws. For
example,  under  New  Jersey  gaming  laws,  generally,  no  person  is  permitted  to  hold  an  ownership  interest  in  or  manage  a  casino  or  own  any  gaming  assets,
including  gaming  devices,  without  being  licensed.  Consequently,  any  lender  who  desires  to  enforce  a  security  interest  must  file  the  necessary  applications  for
licensure, be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJCCC or obtain interim casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest.
Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or of gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and
either found qualified by the NJCCC or obtain ICA prior to obtaining any ownership interest or gaming assets.

Violations of Gaming Laws

If we or our subsidiaries violate applicable gaming laws or regulations, our gaming licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by gaming
regulators, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. Additionally, a trustee, conservator or other person can be appointed by
gaming regulators to operate our gaming properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our gaming assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances,
earnings generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable jurisdictions, or even sell the gaming assets if the gaming license for that property
is  revoked  or  not  renewed.  Violations  of  gaming  laws  or  regulations  in  one  jurisdiction  could  result  in  disciplinary  action  in  other  jurisdictions.  As  a  result,
violations by us of applicable gaming laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.

Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements

We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries which gaming
regulators may require. In some jurisdictions, regulators have authority to compel the production of documents or inspect records maintained on the premises of the
casino.  Under  federal  law,  we  are  required  to  record  and  submit  detailed  reports  of  currency  transactions  involving  greater  than  $10,000  at  our  casinos  and
Suspicious Activity Reports if the facts presented so warrant. Some jurisdictions also require the maintenance of a log that records aggregate cash transactions in
particular  amounts. We are required to maintain  a current stock ledger which may be examined  by gaming regulators at any time. We may also be required to
disclose to gaming regulators upon request the identities of the holders of our equity, debt or other securities. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a
nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming regulators. Failure to make such disclosure may be grounds
for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming regulators may also require certificates for our stock or that of one or more of our subsidiaries to bear a legend
indicating  that  the  securities  are  subject  to  specified  gaming  laws  or  transfer  restrictions.  In  certain  jurisdictions,  gaming  regulators  have  the  power  to  impose
additional restrictions on the holders of our securities at any time.

Review and Approval of Transactions

Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to, or approved by,
gaming regulators. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming regulators if the
securities or the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in such jurisdictions, or to retire or extend obligations
incurred  for  such  purposes.  Such  approval,  if  given,  does  not  constitute  a  recommendation  or  approval  of  the  investment  merits  of  the  securities  subject  to  the
offering. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise, require prior approval
of gaming regulators in certain jurisdictions. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy gaming regulators with respect to a
variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming regulators may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a
material  relationship  or  involvement  with  the  entity  proposing  to  acquire  control  to  be  investigated  and  licensed  as  part  of  the  approval  process  relating  to  the
transaction.

Certain  gaming  laws  and  regulations  in  jurisdictions  we  operate  in  establish  that  certain  corporate  acquisitions  opposed  by  management,  repurchases  of
voting securities and corporate defensive tactics affecting us or our subsidiaries may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming, and as a result, prior
approval may be required before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities (such as repurchases which treat holders differently) above the current
market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. In certain jurisdictions, the gaming regulators also require prior
approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the board of directors of a publicly traded corporation which is registered with the gaming

4

authority in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the registered corporation.

Because licenses under gaming laws are generally not transferable, we may not grant a security interest in our gaming licenses, and our ability to grant a
security interest in any of our gaming assets is limited and may be subject to receipt of prior approval from gaming regulators. A pledge of the stock or other equity
interest in a subsidiary holding a gaming license and the foreclosure of such a pledge may be ineffective without the prior approval of gaming regulators in certain
jurisdictions. Moreover, our subsidiaries holding gaming licenses may be unable to guarantee a security issued by an affiliated or parent company pursuant to a
public offering, or pledge their assets to secure payment of the obligations evidenced by the security issued by an affiliated or parent company, without the prior
approval of certain gaming regulators.

Some  jurisdictions  also  require  us  to  file  a  report  or  notice  with  the  gaming  regulator  within  a  prescribed  period  of  time  following  certain  financial
transactions or the transfer or offering of certain securities. Were they to deem it appropriate, certain gaming regulators reserve the right to order such transactions
rescinded.

Certain jurisdictions require the establishment of a compliance committee with one or more independent members and the implementation of a compliance
review and reporting system or plan created for the purpose of monitoring activities related to our continuing qualification. These plans generally require periodic
reports to senior management of our company and to our gaming regulators.

Certain jurisdictions require that an independent audit committee oversee the functions of surveillance and internal audit departments at our casinos.

License Fees and Gaming Taxes

We pay substantial license fees, contributions to responsible gaming programs, and taxes in many jurisdictions, including the counties, cities, and any related
agencies, boards, commissions, or authorities, in which our operations are conducted, in connection with our casino gaming operations, computed in various ways
depending on the type of gaming or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either daily, monthly,
quarterly or annually. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as:

•    a percentage of the gross revenues received;

•    the number of gaming devices and table games operated; and

•    the particular county in which the casino is located.

A live entertainment tax is also paid in certain jurisdictions by casino operations where entertainment is furnished in connection with the selling or serving of

food or refreshments or the selling of merchandise. The tax rates applicable to our business and operations are subject to change.

Operational Requirements

In many jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our gaming operations. In some jurisdictions, we are
required  to  make  a  good  faith  effort  to  procure  goods  and  services  from  local  suppliers  and  minority-owned,  women-owned  and  veteran-owned  businesses  in
connection with our construction projects.

Some jurisdictions also require us to make a good faith effort to meet workforce diversity and local labor participation goals in our operations and to procure

goods and services from local suppliers and minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses.

Some of our gaming operations are subject to hours of operations restrictions. Additionally, some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the number

of gaming positions we may have.

In 1994, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s
plan include a 500-car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost.
Amendments to the Mississippi gaming regulations impose additional non-gaming infrastructure requirements on new casino projects in Mississippi. To the extent
applicable, our Mississippi casinos are in compliance with these regulations.

Racetracks

We operate Yonkers Raceway, a standardbred harness racing track, and Empire City Casino, a video lottery gaming operation, in Yonkers, New York. The
operations are regulated by the New York State Gaming Commission. We also operate Northfield Park, a standardbred harness racing track, and MGM Northfield
Park,  a  video  lottery  gaming  operation,  in  Northfield,  Ohio.  The  racing  operations  are  regulated  by  the  Ohio  State  Racing  Commission,  and  the  video  lottery
gaming operations are regulated by the Ohio Lottery Commission. In addition to laws and regulations affecting the video lottery operations at these tracks, there
exist extensive laws and regulations governing the operation of racetracks, the horse races that are run at those tracks, and pari-mutuel wagering

5

conducted at the tracks. Regulation of horse racing is typically administered separately from our other gaming operations, with separate licenses and license fee
structures. Racing regulations may limit or dictate the number of days on which races may be or must be held. Additionally, in both New York and Ohio, the video
lottery operations are contingent upon us holding a valid license to hold live horse racing meets at each racing track.

Online Gaming and Sports Betting

In  2013,  Nevada  legalized  real  money  online  poker  within  the  State.  The  NGC  then  adopted  regulations  and  established  licensing  requirements  for  the
operation  of  real  money  online  poker  within  the  State.  In  2013,  New  Jersey  also  legalized  real  money  online  casino  gaming  within  the  State.  The  New  Jersey
Division  of  Gaming  Enforcement  (“NJDGE”)  then  adopted  regulations  and  established  licensing  requirements  for  the  operation  of  real  money  online  casino
gaming in the State. Marina District Development Company, LLC (“MDDC”), our New Jersey subsidiary that operates Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic
City, has been issued an Internet Gaming Permit for real money online gaming in New Jersey.

In  2017,  Mississippi  legalized  on-premises  sports  betting  at  licensed  casinos  subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Mississippi
Gaming Commission (“MGC”). In June 2018, the MGC adopted regulations for the operation of sports books at licensed casinos in Mississippi. The regulations
also  permit  mobile  betting  if  the  player  is  physically  located  within  a  casino  and  hotel  facility  approved  by  the  Executive  Director.  In  July  2018,  our  two
Mississippi operating subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC and MGM Resorts Mississippi, LLC, obtained approval from the Executive Director to offer sports
betting at their respective casino properties, and their respective sports books began operations on August 1, 2018.

In 2018, New Jersey legalized on-premises and online sports betting conducted by licensed casinos and existing and certain former horse race tracks. The
regulation of sports betting in New Jersey is similar to the manner in which the NJDGE regulates online casino gaming and casinos. The NJDGE regulates the
types of wagers that may be placed, but in-play wagering may be permitted. However, wagering on certain events, such as collegiate events in which New Jersey
colleges participate, is prohibited. A casino licensed to offer online sports betting currently may offer no more than three individually branded websites. MDDC
has been issued a Sports Wagering License for on-premises sports betting at Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and online sports betting in New Jersey.

In 2019, Michigan legalized real money online casino gaming and online sports betting for commercial and Indian casinos within the State. On-premises
sports betting commenced on March 11, 2020 under regulations promulgated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board. Online sports betting and casino gaming
commenced on January 22, 2021.

The  gaming  and  other  laws  and  regulations  to  which  we  are  subject  could  change  or  could  be  interpreted  differently  in  the  future,  or  new  laws  and
regulations could be enacted. Any such material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities
could adversely affect our business and operating results. For example,  in 2018, the U.S. Department  of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion
published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of
the  Wire  Act  of  1961 (“Wire  Act”).  The  DOJ’s updated  opinion  concluded  instead  that  the  Wire  Act  was not  uniformly  limited  to  gaming  relating  to  sporting
events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that
the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In January 2021, the Court of Appeals largely affirmed the district court’s decision finding that the Wire Act applies only to
interstate wire communications related to “sporting events or contests”.

Macau S.A.R. Laws and Regulations

MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  regulated  as  a  gaming  operator  under  applicable  Macau  law  and  our  ownership  interest  in  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to
continuing regulatory scrutiny. We are required to be approved by the Macau government (gaming authorities) to own an interest in a gaming operator. Authorized
gaming operators must pay periodic fees and taxes, and gaming rights are not transferable, unless approved by the Macau government. MGM Grand Paradise must
periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authorities
may  require.  No  person  may  acquire  any  rights  over  the  shares  or  assets  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  without  first  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  Macau  gaming
authorities. The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating to
such shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons or entities other than the original owners, would require the
approval of the Macau government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macau gaming authorities. The stock of MGM Grand Paradise
and its casinos, assets and equipment shall not be subject to any liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any
of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount
that is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise. Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement  does not apply to
securities  that  are  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market.  Since  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  securities  are  not  listed  and  tradable  on  a  stock  market  this  approval
requirement  applies  to  transfers  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  shares.  The  Macau  government  must  also  give  their  prior  approval  to  changes  in  control  of  MGM
Grand Paradise through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he
or she obtains control. Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered corporation must satisfy the Macau government concerning a variety of stringent standards
prior to assuming control.

6

The subconcession contract requires the Macau gaming authorities’ prior approval of any recapitalization plan, any increase of the capital stock by public
subscription, any issue of preferential shares or any creation, issue or transformation of types or series of shares representative of MGM Grand Paradise capital
stock, as well as any change in the constituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise. The Chief Executive of Macau could also require
MGM Grand Paradise to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary.

The Macau gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material  involvement with, MGM Grand Paradise to
determine whether MGM Grand Paradise’s suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by that individual. MGM Grand Paradise shareholders with 5% or more
of the share capital and directors must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, and
accept the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macau government. MGM Grand Paradise is required to immediately notify the
Macau government should MGM Grand Paradise become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5%
or more of the share capital, or any director or key employee. Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities. The
Macau gaming authorities have jurisdiction to deny an application for a finding of suitability.

The Macau gaming authorities also have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and

their affiliates.

MGM Macau and MGM Cotai were constructed and are operated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract. This subconcession excludes the
following gaming activities: mutual bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling
activities  on  ships  or  planes.  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  is  exclusively  governed  by  Macau  law.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of Macau in case of any potential dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, the casino area premises and
gaming related equipment subject to reversion in MGM Macau and MGM Cotai will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation
to  MGM  Grand  Paradise  and  MGM  Resorts  International  will  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  these  operations.  Beginning  on  April  20,  2017,  the  Macau
government may redeem the subconcession by giving MGM Grand Paradise at least one year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity.

The  amount  of  such  compensation  or  indemnity  will  be  determined  based  on  the  amount  of  gaming  and  non-gaming  revenue  generated  by MGM Grand
Paradise,  excluding  the  convention  and  exhibition  facilities,  during  the  taxable  year  prior  to  the  redemption,  before  deducting  interest,  depreciation  and
amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession.

The Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon the
occurrence  of  fundamental  non-compliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  the
subconcession contract. If the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though no
specific cure period for that purpose is provided.

Under the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R. an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable
portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas
(approximately  $3.7  million,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December  31,  2021).  The  variable  portion  is  equal  to  300,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  reserved
exclusively for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine,
including slot machines (approximately $37,364, $18,682 and $125, respectively, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2021), subject to a minimum of forty-
five million patacas (approximately $5.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2021). MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special gaming
tax of 35% of gross gaming revenues and applicable withholding taxes. It must also contribute 1.6% and 2.4% (a portion of which must be used for promotion of
tourism in Macau) of its gross gaming revenue to a public foundation designated by the Macau S.A.R. government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as special
levy.

Currently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for
credit losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has to
pay taxes on its winnings from these customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables.

MGM Grand Paradise has received from the Macau government a concession to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau Land
Contract”), and a concession to use an approximately 17.75 acre site parcel of land for MGM Cotai (the “MGM Cotai Land Contract”). The land concessions will
expire on April 6, 2031 and on January 8, 2038, respectively, and are renewable. MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM
Macau  Land  Contract  and  of  the  MGM  Cotai  Land  Contract.  The  rent  amounts  may  be  revised  every  five  years  by  the  Macau  government,  according  to  the
provisions of the Macau Land law.

MGM  Grand  Paradise  received  an  exemption  from  Macau’s  corporate  income  tax  on  profits  generated  by  the  operation  of  casino  games  of  chance  for  a
period of five-years starting at January 1, 2007. In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.
The exemption was further extended on September 7, 2016 through March 31, 2020, and further extended again on March 24, 2020 effective from April 1, 2020
through June 26, 2022.
