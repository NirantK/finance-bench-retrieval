PART I

Item 1. - Business

The Company

        Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July
2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited company
incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.

Bemis Company, Inc. Merger

        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the
"Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor
shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDI's representing our shares on the
Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC." In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE.

Business Strategy

Strategy

        Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are
determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.

Focused portfolio

        Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:

• A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•
•
• multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.

good industry structure,
attractive relative growth, and

        These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.

Differentiated capabilities

        "The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership,
Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.

Shareholder value creation

        Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of
our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends
and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.

Segment Information

        Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set
forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons,
and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to
Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments.

Flexibles Segment

        The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the
Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s
consolidated net sales.

Rigid Packaging Segment

        The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2020, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000
employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2020, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Marketing, Distribution, and Competition

        Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America,
Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design
technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization.

        We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0%
of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these
business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.

         The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors
include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper
Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies.

        We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not
reasonably determinable.

Backlog

        Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between
obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a
significant factor in the industries in which we operate.

Raw Materials

        Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are
not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw
material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate.

7

Intellectual Property

        We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a
number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks
collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our
reporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.

Sustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations

        We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products, and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of
products. It extends shelf life and reduces food
and other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers want cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe
responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation.

        Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our
packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world.

        We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and
with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely
positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the
most important growth opportunities for Amcor.

        Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of
certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment. We believe that
we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of
those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future, incur liability, with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to
contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials,
which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A.
"Risk Factors".

Employees

        As of June 30, 2020, we employed approximately 47,000 people worldwide, with approximately 42% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relations with
employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years. For more on collective
bargaining and labor disputes, see "Item 1A - Risk Factors."

Seasonal Factors

        The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent.

Research and Development

        Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies.

Item 1A. - Risk Factors

        The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or, that we presently believe are not material, could also
affect our business operations and financial results.

Strategic Risks

Changes in Consumer Demand — We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries.

        Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that
we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result
in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining
sales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to
many factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely
and cost-effective manner.

        Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand
for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Key Customers and Customer Consolidation — The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse
impact on our sales revenue and profitability.

        Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers. From time to time, a
single customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer
accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other
customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods.

        Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production
requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.

        There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms of packaging, begin
manufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.

        Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which
effect may be material.

        In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business
with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a
price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our
customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition — We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.

        We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures and competitive behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing
business in the industries and regions in which

10

we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness.

        The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, our competitors may
develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. No assurance can be given that the actions of
established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Expanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, or acquisitions.

        Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets, product
innovation, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control. Our ability to grow organically may be
limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic
priorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences.
Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

        Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Bemis in 2019. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable
acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the
industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that
competition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible, price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their
historical averages. If, as a result of these and other factors, we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential
for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting
expected financial benefits.

Integration — We may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition.

        We may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and
challenges with integrating the business cultures. In addition, the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations.

        We generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. For example, we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will
generate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement, manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies. While
we are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergies, we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained. If we are not able to
successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than
expected or involve more costs to do so.

Intellectual Property — Challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.

        Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. We own a number of patents on
our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and we own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the
packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our
intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements.
However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with
us. Furthermore, many of

11

the countries in which we operate, particularly the emerging markets, do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in
which we operate, such as the United States and the European Union. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive
advantages, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business. Similarly, while we
have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in
the future. If we were held liable for a claim of infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. Intellectual property litigation, which
could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of
the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any
necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial
condition and results of operations.

Operational Risks

Global Health Outbreaks — Our business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak or other similar outbreaks.

        Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in
December 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the
virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude
essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing
essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand
for our products in the future. We have also impaired an equity method investment by $25.6 million in the fourth quarter, in part, partially due to general market declines associated with the
pandemic. See Note 7, "Equity Method Investments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment.

        The outbreak has in the past, and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities, the facilities of our suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. In limited cases to date,
certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities, which has impacted their demand, and we may continue to experience the volatility in
demand from temporary customer shutdowns. In addition, the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries, including
negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn,
such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to
manage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect
could be material.

Global Operations — Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.

        Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and
other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The current global
economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and
related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies.

        When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have
difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in a loss of business. Weakened
global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business,
cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.

12

        Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union has
resulted in uncertainty regarding the long-term nature of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct
of market participants. Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers
and employees, and adversely impact profitability.

International Operations — Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.

        We have operations throughout the world, including facilities located in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 74% of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26%
came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future, particularly in the emerging markets.

        Management of global operations is extremely complex, particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural, political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we
operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India and other emerging markets, have underdeveloped or developing legal, regulatory or
political systems, which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest.

        The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things:

•
•
•
•

•
•

changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;
changes in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, local laws and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws;
nullification, modification or renegotiation of, or difficulties or delays in enforcing, contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law;
reversal of current political, judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade, or relating to the use of local agents, representatives or partners in
the relevant jurisdictions;
pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting various regions of the world unequally; or
changes in exchange rates and inflation, including hyperinflation, which may be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        Further, sustained periods of legal, regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and
results of operations, which effect may be material.

        The international scope of our operations, which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of
Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations (collectively,
‘‘Sanctions’’), and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to Sanctions, also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures. Failure to do so could result in
breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those relating to money laundering, corruption, export control, fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition and economic
sanctions, whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise. Any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business,
which effect may be material.

Raw Materials — Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business.

        As a manufacturer of packaging products, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs, including energy. All of the raw
materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films, inks and solvents, aluminum and fiber-based carton board. Prices for these raw materials
are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), currency and commodity price
fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Increases in
costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including by entering into contracts with certain customers
which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw

13

material costs, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements, there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw
material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may
be material.

Commercial Risks — We are subject to production, supply and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn.

        We face a number of commercial risks, including (i) operational disruption, such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic),
each of which could, in turn, lead to production loss and/or increased costs, (ii) shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and (iii) risks
associated with development projects (such as cost overruns and delays). In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by
natural disasters, including earthquakes, snowstorms, hurricanes, forest fires and flooding. Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that
could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime.

        Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other natural
disasters, could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers. Such
disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain
facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to
prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution
or other business activities.

        Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our customers, suppliers and financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers, may have a significant adverse effect
on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility (such as economic volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), either globally or in the
geographies and industries in which our customers operate. If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these
outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a
replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or, alternatively, fulfill those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive. The occurrence of any of these risks, including any default by our
counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage.

Information technology — A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data and could
negatively affect our business.

        We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions, and on various
technologies to process, store and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. In addition, our information systems increasingly
rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third
party vendors on market standards. As with all large systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption, information loss or shutdown due to power outages,
failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access
and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality.

        We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to
protect such information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, misplaced or lost data and programming
and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information. Information system damages, disruptions, shutdowns or compromises could result in
production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers and business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or
intervention, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow,
financial condition and results

14

of operations, which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks,
products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.

Attracting and retaining key personnel — If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be adversely affected.

        Our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas. Losing the services of key
employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives. There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate and retain employees in the future
who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture.

Operational hazards — We are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.

        We are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws, rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business. Many of our products come into contact with
the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require
significant expenditure of financial and employee resources.

        In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in
the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators
in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate
change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not
be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot
predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance.

        Federal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate
change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the
costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own, used or operate (including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future). Legal
proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditure.

        The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business. A number of governmental bodies have introduced, or are contemplating introducing, regulatory
change to address the impacts of climate change, which, where implemented, may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results.

        We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating to the damage of natural resources, lost property
values and toxic tort claims. Provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential environmental damage, and the extent of our
liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the
currently provisioned amount. Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position, which may be material.

Labor disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which could adversely affect our business.

        Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future, including protests and strikes,
which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be good, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future.

15

Financial Risks

LIBOR Indexed Borrowings — The expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase.

        A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates
Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by
short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.

        Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate some financing
agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest
rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of
such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Exchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.

        We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance. Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from
exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are denominated, which may affect our business input
costs and proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to U.S. dollars, consistent with
our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses. In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the
exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement.

        Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly. For instance, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns,
including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have weighed on the Mexican and Brazilian economies, respectively. In addition, we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the
currency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting.

        To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which
would adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow,
financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.

Interest rates — An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.

        Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount
of interest we pay. Refer to Note 13, "Debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates.

Credit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

        In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper, drawdown bank loans and issue long-term bonds to meet our funding needs. Credit rating agencies rate
our debt securities on many factors, including our financial results, their view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the global economy. Actions taken by
the rating agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade. If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, or
place us on a watch list, the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper market, an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an
increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets.

16

Refer to "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," for more information on our credit rating profile.

Hedging — Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.

        We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floating-rate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our board of directors has
approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates. The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any
time. If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks, if we are under-hedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging
arrangements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Goodwill and other intangible assets — A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net
worth.

        As of June 30, 2020, we had $7.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a
discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill
and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes
in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or
intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of
operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate. See "Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," "Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Internal Controls — If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.

        As a newly listed NYSE public company in 2019, we elected the transition period for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to furnish a report by
management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our
management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation
from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, during our transition period, we were exempt from Section 404
compliance until we filed our second Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 (which is this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

        Amcor Limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in Australia including the preparation of its financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards ("AAS") as adopted by
the Australian Accounting Standards Board and other relevant companies law. Amcor Limited was not required to comply with U.S. GAAP. Following the consummation of the Bemis acquisition, we
now prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS
financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting
in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020, see "Item 9A, Controls and
Procedures," for further information.

        We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process. Specifically,
we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information.

17

        We are currently in the process of remediating the second material weakness through a process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of
segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and
implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on segregation of duties. Given that we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest
locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021. We believe that these enhanced resources and processes, including the implementation of
new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the second material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period
of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively.

        Failure to remediate the material weakness described above at all or within our expected timeframe, or any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a
misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.

Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face.

        We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with third-
party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover property damage and business interruption, public and products liability and directors' and officers' liability. Although we believe
the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice, they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will
ultimately be paid.

        Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in Singapore. Our captive insurance company collects
annual premiums from our business groups, and assumes specific risks relating to property damage, business interruption and liability claims. The captive insurance company may be required to
make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captive's reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.

Legal and Compliance Risks

Litigation — Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.

        We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Given
our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal
proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require
substantial payments. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation
against us. Refer to "Item 3. - Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental, health, and safety regulations — Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters may adversely affect our company.

        Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about Greenhouse Gas emissions and climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that
utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material
cost, as well as energy and freight costs. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring
and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated
markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Patents and proprietary technology — Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop, acquire and retain intellectual property rights.

        Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and
licensing arrangements, to establish our

18

proprietary rights. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer. Our pending patent applications, and our pending trademark registration
applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. In addition, our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not
provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect
infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing
competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share
and could result in lost revenues.

Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares

Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. jurisdiction
and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S. corporations.

        We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European
Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law, including
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and by the Amcor Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time. These rights differ in some respects from the rights of other
shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect
investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.

U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us.

        A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a
result, it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the United States upon those non-U.S. directors and officers, or to enforce judgments realized in the United States.

        Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S., including those in Australia and Jersey, may be
subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., including Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the
securities laws of the U.S. Additionally, our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us, the Royal Court
of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers, actions arising out of Companies (Jersey) Law
1991, as amended, or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder
actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. However, there is
uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.

Overview

        Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other products. Amcor works with
leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging,
specialty cartons, closures, and services. The company is focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled
content. During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries.

Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented

Impact of COVID-19

        The 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor’s operations have been largely recognized as 'essential' by governments
and authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and
suppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles
focusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities.

Health and Safety

        Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that
maintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms,
frequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is
adequately contained for our business.

Operations and Supply Chain

        To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response,
return to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have
experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance,
in April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and Latin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and on-the-go channels.
Our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the
essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including
temporary closures of our facilities.

        We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain to date and continue to monitor the risk of customer, raw material and other supply chain disruptions.

Contributions to Our Communities

        To support our local communities, we launched a global program to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by donating food and healthcare packaging products and by funding local community
initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education or food and other essential products.

Looking Ahead

        We believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact
on the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across
the supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.

The Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.

        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the United
States, for the purchase price of $5.2 billion in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of debt.

2019 Bemis Integration Plan

        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As previously
announced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year
2022.

        Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring
and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in
fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration
costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were
payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year
2022.

        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs
are not linked to restructuring. We believe the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs
relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities.

Other Restructuring Plans

        On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.
The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost
reductions.

        Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing
facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments.
We estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging
Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.

        On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was
designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost
base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.

        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8
million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment
and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million.
The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.

26

Impairment in Equity Method Investment

        Due to impairment indicators present for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we performed impairment tests by comparing the carrying value of its investment in AMVIG Holdings
Limited ("AMVIG") at the end of each period, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. We recorded impairment
charges in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $25.6 million, $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, as the fair value of the investment was below its carrying value. Refer to Note 7, "Equity
Method Investments" for more information about our equity method investments.

Highly Inflationary Accounting

        We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentinean subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional
currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. The transition to highly inflationary accounting resulted in a negative impact of $27.7 million and $30.2 million that was reflected on the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

        Income tax expense increased by $15.4 million, or 9.0%, to $186.9 million for fiscal year 2020, from $171.5 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the higher overall
profit of the total Company with a full year of Bemis’ results having been included compared to three weeks in fiscal year 2019.

        The effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 reduced relative to 2019 mainly due to the decrease in non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of Bemis. The current year
effective tax rate is reflective of a greater proportion of the business in the U.S. as a result of the Bemis acquisition.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information

        This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP"): adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing operations, adjusted net income from continuing operations, and net debt. These non-GAAP financial
measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reform, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,
acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses
on sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, pension settlements and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses,
professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments.

        This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined under U.S. GAAP. Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating
performance and believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company.

        A reconciliation of reported net income attributable to Amcor plc to Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations and adjusted net income for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, commercial paper, borrowings from banks and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We
periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for
debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of
access to funding sources.

        Based on our current and expected cash flow from operating activities and available cash, we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under
our credit facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures and other commitments, including dividends, into the foreseeable future.

        Net cash inflows provided by operating activities increased by $608.1 million, or 78.4%, to $1,384.2 million for fiscal year 2020, from $776.1 million for fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to impacts from the Bemis acquisition.

        Cash Flow from Investing Activities

        Net cash inflows provided by investing activities increased by $27.7 million, or 271.6%, to $37.9 million for fiscal year 2020, from a $10.2 million inflow for fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the EC Remedy related to the Bemis acquisition as compared to the U.S. Remedy in the fiscal year 2019, partially offset by higher capital expenditures
as a result of the Bemis acquisition.

        Capital expenditures were $399.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $67.3 million compared to $332.2 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily
due to the increased capital spending following the Bemis acquisition.

        Cash Flow from Financing Activities

        Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $471.5 million, or 61.6%, to $1,236.4 million for fiscal year 2020, from a $764.9 million outflow for fiscal year 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the $500 million on-market share buy-back program, partially offset by net inflows from long and short-term debt sources.

Net Debt

        We borrow money from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed
and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.

        Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we
have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of the long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance
sheet date.

35

        Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to a range between 7.5% to
15.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt require us to comply with certain financial
covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of June 30, 2020, we are in
compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities and U.S. private placement debt.

        Our net debt as of both June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 was $5.5 billion.

Available Financing

        As of June 30, 2020, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $1.8 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, growth capital expenditures and
refinancing obligations and are provided to us by five separate bank syndicates. On September 25, 2019 and December 15, 2019, we canceled $250.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of the
$750.0 million term loan facility.

        During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company extended the maturity of a 364-day syndicated facility by an additional six months to October 2020 and reduced the facility size from
$1,050.0 million to $840 million. This facility was canceled on June 29, 2020 following the issuance of a $500.0 million 10 year senior unsecured note on June 19, 2020 and a €500.0 million 7 year
senior unsecured note on June 23, 2020.

        As of June 30, 2020, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $4.2 billion, of which $2.4 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper
programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Our senior facilities mature between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, with an option to extend.

Dividend Payments

        In fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid $761.1 million, $679.7 million and $526.8 million, respectively, in dividends.

Credit Rating

        Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our
ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various tenors and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets and from global
financial institutions.

Share Repurchases

        On August 21, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an on-market buy-back of $500 million of ordinary shares and Chess Depositary Instruments ("CDIs"). During the twelve months ended
June 30, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately $500.0 million, excluding transaction costs, or 53.9 million shares. The shares repurchased as part of the program were canceled upon
repurchase.

        We had cash outflows of $67.0 million, $20.2 million and $35.7 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as treasury shares
to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards and shares purchased for shareholder settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As of June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
we held treasury shares at cost of $67.0 million, $16.1 million and $10.7 million, representing 6.7 million, 1.4 million and 0.9 million shares, respectively.

(2) Variable interest rate commitments are based on the current contractual maturity date of the underlying facility, calculated on the existing drawdown at June 30, 2020, after allowing for increases/(decreases) in

projected bank reference rates.

(3) We lease certain manufacturing sites, office space, warehouses, land, vehicles and equipment under operating leases. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. Not included in the
above commitments are contingent rental payments which may arise as part of the rental increase indexed to the consumer price index or in the event that units produced by certain leased assets exceed a
predetermined production capacity.

(4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

        Other than as described under "Contractual Obligations" as of June 30, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet contractual obligations or other commitments.

Liquidity Risk and Outlook

        In 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. However, our access was temporarily restricted in March both in the U.S. and Europe due to
the impact from COVID-19 on financial markets. We refinanced these maturities with drawings under our committed bank facilities. As a precautionary measure to maximize liquidity, in March
2020, we also extended our 364-day syndicated facility by an additional six months to October 2020 while reducing the facility size from $1,050.0 million to $840.0 million. This facility was
canceled on June 29, 2020 following the issuance of a $500.0 million 10-year senior unsecured note on June 19, 2020 and a €500.0 million 7-year senior unsecured note on June 23, 2020. The
Company also filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on June 10, 2020, which enabled the Company to issue the two notes in June 2020 and will enable the Company to issue debt securities in
the future when market conditions are favorable and on a timely basis.

        Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we might encounter difficulty in settling our debts or otherwise meeting our obligations related to financial liabilities. We manage our liquidity risk
centrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our
business, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, commercial paper and factoring. The following
guidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:

regularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activities;
generally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;

• maintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;
•
•
• maintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;
• managing credit risk related to financial assets;

only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
to the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.

        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $1,976.5 million and $221.2 million, respectively, was drawn under our commercial paper programs. However, such programs
are backstopped by committed bank syndicated loan facilities with maturities in April 2022 ($750.0 million), April 2023 ($1.5 billion) and April 2024 ($1.5 billion), with an option to extend, under
which we had $1.8 billion in unused capacity remaining as of June 30, 2020.

        We expect long-term future funding needs to primarily relate to refinancing and servicing our outstanding financial liabilities maturing as outlined above and to finance our growth capital
expenditure and payments for acquisitions that may be completed. We expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow
provided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis. We
decide on discretionary growth capital expenditures and acquisitions individually based on, among other factors, the return on investment after related financing costs and the payback period of
required upfront cash investments in light of our mid-term liquidity planning covering a period of four years post the current financial year. Our long-term access to liquidity depends on both our
results of operations and on the availability of funding in financial markets.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

        Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to
retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, equity method investments and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

        We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill;
calculation of deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions;
calculation of equity method investments; and
calculation of acquisition fair values.

Considerations Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic

        The impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated operations is uncertain. While the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material, we have
experienced volatility in customer order patterns. We have considered the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020 and
will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations.

Pension Costs

        Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Net periodic pension cost recorded in fiscal year 2020 was $9.9 million, compared to pension cost of $12.5 million in fiscal year 2019 and $7.7 million in fiscal year 2018. We expect pension expense
before the effect of income taxes for fiscal year 2021 to be approximately $12.7 million.

        For our sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to
determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to

38

our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions
and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends
performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.

        The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset, in the case of an
overfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information
about the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date
recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined
benefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statement of income separately from the service cost component and outside
operating income.

        We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond
yield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate
bonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields. Additionally,
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term
return assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.

        Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or
when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting
unit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have six reporting units, of which five are included in our
Flexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reporting segment is Rigid Packaging.

        Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during
the year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the
reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.

        In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or
elect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches. The most

39

significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the estimated net sales and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, discount
rate and terminal values.

        Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining fair value amounts, including undiscounted projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually.
Factors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the need for more frequent
assessments.

        Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks and software and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,
which range from one to 20 years. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The
test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and discount rates. These estimates and projections require judgments as to
future events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.

Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions

        We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of
whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant
estimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit. Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax
assets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we
do not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the
feasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future
changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

Equity Accounted Investments

        Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid. The
assessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decline requires significant estimates.

        We review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For example, we tested our
investment in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") for impairment at March 31, 2020 given that the quoted share price had experienced a significant decline in the month of March associated with
general market declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of March, we concluded that the decline was temporary, and the investment was not impaired given our intention to hold the
investment. However, the quoted share price did not recover in our fiscal fourth quarter and we determined that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of
$25.6 million. We also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.

Acquisitions

        We record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-
controlling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the
net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,
especially with respect to intangible assets.

40

        We use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions. The fair value
measurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Critical estimates in valuing
intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired developed technology, corporate trade name and brand names; the period of time we expect
to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.

        In estimating the future cash flows, we consider demand, competition, other economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans. We utilize common valuation techniques such
as discounted cash flows and market approaches, including the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired developed technology, trade names and brand names. Customer relationships are valued
using the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method. We believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.

        In connection with a given business acquisition, we may identify pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition
contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities
assumed and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.

        In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly
based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period.

        We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business acquisition. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is
recognized and measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the liability is incurred. We reflect acquired operations that we intend to dispose of as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income and as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet.

Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Overview

        Our activities expose us to a variety of market risks and financial risks. Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on Amcor's financial
performance. From time to time, we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, commodity fixed price swaps (on behalf of customers) and interest rate
swaps to manage these risks. Our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities, which provide guidelines for control,
counterparty risk and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices and to fixed
and variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility. However, we do not trade in
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entity's functional currency to economically
hedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non U.S. subsidiaries, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility.

        There have been no material changes in the risks described below, other than increased volatility in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 related to
interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk.

Interest Rate Risk

        Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating
interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps.

        A hypothetical but reasonably possible increase of 1% in the floating rate on the relevant interest rate yield curve applicable to both, derivative and non-derivative instruments denominated in
U.S. dollars, the currency with the largest interest rate sensitivity, outstanding as of June 30, 2020, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income
(loss) of affiliated companies of $17.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.

Foreign Exchange Risk

        We operate in over 40 countries across the world.

        For the year ended June 30, 2020, a hypothetical but reasonably possible adverse change of 1% in the underlying average foreign currency exchange rate for the Euro would have resulted in an
adverse impact on our net sales of $22.3 million.

        During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 49% and 36% of our net sales, respectively, were effectively generated in U.S. dollar functional currency entities. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 18% and
24% of net sales, respectively, were generated in Euro functional currency entities with the remaining 33% and 40% of net sales, respectively, being generated in entities with functional currencies
other than U.S. dollars and Euros. The impact of translating Euro and other non-U.S. dollar net sales and operating expenses into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes will vary depending on the
movement of those currencies from period to period.

Raw Material and Commodity Price Risk

        The primary raw materials for our products are resins, film, aluminum, and liquids. We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and are exposed to commodity
price risk from a number of commodities and certain other raw materials and energy price risk.

        Changes in prices of our key raw materials and commodities, including resins, film, aluminum, inks, solvents, adhesives and liquids and other raw materials, may result in a temporary or
permanent reduction in income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies depending on the level of recovery by material type. The level of recovery depends both on the
type of material and the market in which we operate. Across our business, we have a number of contractual provisions that allow for passing on of raw material price fluctuations to customers within
predefined periods.

        A hypothetical but reasonably possible 1% increase on average prices for resins, film, aluminum and liquids, not passed on to the customer by way of a price adjustment, would have resulted in
an increase in cost of sales and hence an

42

adverse impact on income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 of $56.9 million and $41.4 million, respectively.

Credit Risk

        Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. We are exposed to credit risk arising from financing activities including
deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments, as well as from over-the-counter raw material and commodity related derivative
instruments.

        We manage our credit risk from balances with financial institutions through our counterparty risk policy, which provide guidelines on setting limits to minimize the concentration of risks and
therefore mitigating financial loss through potential counterparty failure and on dealing and settlement procedures. The investment of surplus funds is made only with approved counterparties and
within credit limits assigned to each specific counterparty. Financial derivative instruments can only be entered into with high credit quality approved financial institutions. As of June 30, 2020 and
2019, we did not have a significant concentration of credit risk in relation to derivatives entered into in accordance with our hedging and risk management activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amcor plc

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amcor plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves
for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the design and operating effectiveness of internal
controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, management did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT
systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the June 30, 2020 consolidated financial
statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2020.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal

44

control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America Reporting Units within the Flexibles Segment

As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $5,339.3 million at June 30, 2020, and the goodwill associated with the
Flexibles Segment was $4,369.1 million, which includes goodwill associated with the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units. Management conducts an impairment
analysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Management performed a quantitative assessment for
goodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
management would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount
of the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s projected future cash flows for the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units included significant judgments and
assumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting
units within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led
to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth,
projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these
procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the
effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units.
These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the
completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including

45

revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, and
terminal values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with
external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used
to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow models and certain significant assumptions, including the terminal values and discount rates.

Note 1 - Business Description

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

        Amcor plc ("Amcor" or the "Company") is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick
of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited
company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. On June 11, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"). The combination of Amcor and Bemis
has created a global packaging leader. See Note 4, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," for more information on the Bemis acquisition.

        The Company develops and produces a broad range of packaging products including flexible packaging, rigid packaging containers, specialty cartons, and closures. The Company employs
approximately 47,000 individuals and has 231 principal manufacturing facilities in more than 40 countries.

        The Company's business activities are organized around two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The Company has a globally diverse operating footprint, selling to customers in
Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales made to the defensive food, beverage,
pharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality and service.

53

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP").

Business Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition
date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the net of the
acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has the ability to
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of
assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.

Discontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a discontinued
operation in fiscal 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European Commission. See Note 5, "Discontinued Operations," for more information on
discontinued operations. The plants were divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Estimates and Assumptions Required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

        These estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and
adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their impacts cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. In the opinion of
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presented.

        The impact that the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic will have on the Company's consolidated operations is uncertain. The Company has considered the potential impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic when developing the Company's estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020, and will continue to evaluate the extent of the impact on the Company's business and
consolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and the change could be material in future periods.

Translation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the local currency of such entity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies
other than the entity’s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to
short-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), net, in the consolidated statement of income. The Company recorded such foreign currency transaction net loss of
$0.4 million, net gain of $1.1 million and net loss of $82.7 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income. These foreign currency transaction net gains amounted to $21.4 million, $8.9 million and $1.0 million during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

        Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are translated using average exchange rates in effect
during each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, while equity balances are
translated at historical rates. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders’ equity.

Highly Inflationary Accounting: A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period. If a
country's economy is classified as highly inflationary, the financial statements of the foreign entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the parent. As of July 1,
2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency for the Company's
subsidiaries in Argentina. The impact of

54

highly inflationary accounting was $27.7 million and $30.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the consolidated statement of income.

Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible and rigid packaging serving a variety of markets including food, consumer products and healthcare
end markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with customers, including quality agreements, pricing agreements and master supply agreements which outline the terms under which
the Company does business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Company has concluded for the vast majority of its revenues,
that its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combination of a purchase order with a master supply agreement. All revenue recognized in the consolidated statement of income is
considered to be revenue from contracts with customers.

        The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred to customers. Revenue is recognized net of
allowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company does not have any material contract
assets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20, "Segments".

Significant Judgments

        Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The
Company identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from
the supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.

        The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates
or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume. The Company
accounts for variable consideration using the most likely amount method. The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement and updates its
judgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.

        The Company enters into long term agreements with certain customers, under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for which it expects to receive a benefit in excess of the
cost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheet.
Contract incentives are typically recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement.

Practical Expedients

        The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any external sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. External sales
commission expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income.

        The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of products sold while amounts
billed to customers are classified as a component of net sales.

        The Company excluded from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing
transaction and collected from the customer, including sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes and use taxes. Accordingly, the tax amounts are not included in net sales.

        The Company does not adjust the promised consideration for the time value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of payment and performance is one year or less.

Research and Development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.

Restructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company calculates severance obligations based on its standard customary practices. Accordingly, the
Company records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard customary

55

practice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are recognized when incurred. If fixed assets are to be disposed of as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, the assets are written
off when the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in use. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time the asset continues to be used until the asset ceases
to be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate equipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the service is provided. See Note 6, "Restructuring Plans," for more
information on the Company’s restructuring plans.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
include certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value.

Trade Receivables, Net: Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated losses resulting from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. When determining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of factors are evaluated, including: customer creditworthiness,
past transaction history with the customer and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends and a review of
the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $35.3 million
and $34.4 million recorded at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in trade receivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheet. The current year expense to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts
is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.

        The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sales of receivables are accounted for in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ("ASC 860"). Agreements which result in true sales of the
transferred receivables, as defined in ASC 860, which occur when receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the
consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Agreements that allow the Company to maintain
effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale, as defined in ASC 860, are accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statement of income primarily as a reduction of net sales.
Factored receivables not qualifying as a true sale were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, amounts factored recorded under trade receivables, net and short-term
debt, were zero and $152.7 million, respectively.

Inventories: Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. Inventory values using the FIFO method of
accounting approximate replacement cost.

        Inventories are summarized at June 30, 2020 and 2019 as follows:

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net: Property, plant and equipment ("PP&E"), net is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and includes expenditures for new facilities and
equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period.
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.

        PP&E, including assets held under finance leases, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets or, in the case of leasehold improvements and leased
assets, over the period of the lease or useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter, as described below. The Company periodically reviews these estimated useful lives and, when appropriate, changes
are made prospectively.

        For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided for as deferred income
taxes.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily PP&E and certain identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment when facts or circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value
of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as applicable.

        Impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income were as follows:

Leasing: The Company has operating leases for certain manufacturing sites, office space, warehouses, land, vehicles and equipment. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at
the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term, which includes renewal periods the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company
reevaluates its leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising lease renewal options. Short term leases with a term of twelve months or less, including
reasonably certain holding periods, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. As the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing
rate as of the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the
consolidated statement of income. Certain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons. Variable lease payments that do not
depend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and recognized as expense in the period in which the obligation for the
payments occur.

Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested annually or whenever events and
circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporting unit’s operating results significantly declining
relative to its operating plan or historical performance, and competitive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operates. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global
impacts, the Company considered the potential for goodwill impairment of its reporting units in the third fiscal quarter of 2020. The review did not indicate an impairment triggering event as of
March 31, 2020.

        All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the operating segment. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in
the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. With this change, the Company has
six reporting units with goodwill that are assessed for potential impairment.

        In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill
impairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The
Company's quantitative assessment utilizes present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill. Determining fair value using discounted cash
flows requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and market factors. Key assumptions relate to revenue growth, projected

57

operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, or if market factors outside of Amcor’s control, such as factors
impacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or political conditions in key markets, change significantly, then goodwill allocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired.

        The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year.

        A quantitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fiscal quarter for all reporting units for the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2018, while a qualitative analysis was performed for the
fiscal year ended 2019. The Company’s annual impairment analysis for all three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company’s quantitative goodwill analysis in fiscal years
2020 and 2018 concluded that the fair values substantially exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit.

        Although no reporting units failed the assessments noted above in the annual impairment analysis for 2020, during the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at June 30, 2020, the
Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting
units may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no such events have occurred.

Other Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,
with original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the
amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value
may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.

        Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer software within other intangible assets.

Fair Value Measurements: The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company determines fair value based on a three-tiered fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of:

•

•

•

Level 1: fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date;
Level 2: fair value measurements are determined using input prices that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with
observable market data; and
Level 3: fair value measurements are determined using unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity
for the asset or liability.

Financial Instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these
instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through income. Depending on the nature of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are either offset against the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders’ equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized.
Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings over the life of the hedging relationship.

        See Note 11, "Derivative Instruments," for more information regarding specific derivative instruments included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, such as forward foreign currency
exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements, among other derivative instruments.

Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans to which it makes contributions on behalf of employees. The expense under such plans was $63.5 million, $39.9
million and $39.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

58

        The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit plans that provide benefits to current and former employees. For the company-sponsored plans, the relevant accounting guidance requires
that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation
rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to
change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical
trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by the Company’s actuaries. However, actual results may differ
substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.

        The Company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan in the consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is
recognized as a liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals
covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the
average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined benefits are included in
operating income. The other components of net benefit cost other than service cost are recorded within other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated statement of income

Equity Method Investments: Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which the Company believes it exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of
acquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. The fair value of the investment then becomes the
new cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Impairment losses have been recognized for the Company's equity investment in AMVIG Holdings
Limited ("AMVIG") in the last three fiscal years. See Note 7, "Equity Method Investments," for more information regarding the Company's equity method investments.

Share-based Compensation: Amcor has a variety of equity incentive plans. For employee awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period on
a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. For awards with a performance condition, the Company must reassess
the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation cost based on its probability assessment. The Company also has cash-settled share-based compensation plans which are
accounted for as liabilities. Such share-based awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates forfeitures based on employee level, economic conditions, time
remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience.

Income Taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported
in the consolidated financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense
included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.

        Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that
any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from
various tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions.
Accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. See Note 16, "Income Taxes," for more information on the Company's income
taxes.

Note 3 - New Accounting Guidance

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

        In March 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, "Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a
Registrant's Securities" that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registered securities under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The rule replaces the requirement to provide condensed
consolidating financial information with a requirement to present summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors in either a note to the financial statements or in management's
discussion and analysis. The effective date of the amendment is January 4, 2021 with earlier voluntary compliance permitted. The Company elected to adopt the amended rules effective with our third
fiscal quarter of 2020 and has included the required disclosures as a component of "Part II, Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance that requires the Company to disclose a description of the Company’s accounting policy for releasing
income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income and whether the Company elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act"), along
with information about other income tax effects that are reclassified. For all entities, the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Entities can choose whether to apply the amendments retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Act is recognized or to apply the amendments in the period of adoption.
This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019. The Company adopted the new guidance effective July 1, 2019 and did not elect the optional reclassification as the impact was not
material.

        In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the
financial statements. For public business entities, the amendments in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12 were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, with the exception of
presentation and disclosure guidance which is adopted prospectively. Implementation of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

        In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that required lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to past
accounting guidance. The guidance also eliminates the previous real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs
for all entities. Lease classification will determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. The Company adopted the new lease standard at July 1, 2019 using a simplified transition
option that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and therefore did not restate prior periods. The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients
which allows for existing operating leases to continue to be classified as operating leases under the new guidance without reassessing whether the contracts contain a lease under the new guidance or
whether classification of the operating lease would be different under the new standard. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient but did adopt the practical expedient
pertaining to land easements which provides the option not to reassess whether land easements not previously accounted for as leases under prior leasing guidance would be leases under the new
guidance.

        Adoption of the new leasing standard resulted in the following impacts to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date: the establishment of a lease liability
of $590.5 million, including current portion, a corresponding right-of-use asset of $569.8 million, and the reclassification of approximately $58.2 million (net of tax) of deferred gains on sale
leaseback transactions.

        The complete impact of the changes made to the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new leasing guidance were as follows:

        Due to the adoption of the guidance using the simplified transition option, there are no changes to the Company's previously reported results prior to July 1, 2019. Lease expense is not expected
to change materially as a result of adoption of the new guidance. The Company changed its disclosures related to leasing beginning in fiscal year 2020. Refer to Note 14, "Leases".

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

        In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires financial assets, or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected
when finalized. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected
to be collected on the financial asset. This guidance affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables and any other
financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2020 and will be adopted using the modified retrospective
approach. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

        In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and improving the consistent application of U.S. GAAP in
other tax accounting areas. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2020 with early adoption
permitted. Accordingly, the guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.

        In March 2020, the FASB issued optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform related to contract modifications, hedging relationships,
and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. The Company is
currently evaluating whether to elect the adoption of this optional guidance.

        The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB and SEC. The Company determined that all other ASUs not yet adopted to be either not applicable or are
expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements at this time.

Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures

Year ended June 30, 2019

Bemis Company, Inc.

        On June 11, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in
the United States. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2018, each outstanding share of Bemis common stock that was issued and outstanding upon completion of the
transaction was converted into the right to receive 5.1 ordinary shares of the Company traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

        The acquisition of Bemis positioned the Company as a global leader in consumer packaging with a comprehensive global footprint in flexible packaging and greater scale in key regions of North
America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, along with industry-leading research and development capabilities.

        The acquisition of Bemis was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," which required allocation of the purchase price to the estimated
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were finalized upon completion of the
measurement period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. The allocation was subject to change within the measurement period, up to one year from the acquisition date, as additional information
concerning final asset and liability valuations was obtained. The measurement period adjustments resulted in a $229.9 million increase to goodwill, which includes a $210.6 million decrease to
property, plant and equipment, a $99.0 million decrease to finite lived intangible assets, a $184.1 million decrease to deferred tax liabilities, a $97.9 million increase in other non-current liabilities,
along with other adjustments to assets held for sale and working capital.

        The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $3,367.6 million of goodwill for the Flexibles Segment, which is not tax deductible. The goodwill on acquisition represents the future economic
benefit expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce and non-contractual relationships, as well as expected future
synergies.

        The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair
value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals and market comparables.

Divestitures

        Closing of the Bemis acquisition was conditional upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders, and satisfaction of other customary conditions. In
order to satisfy certain regulatory approvals, the Company was required to divest three of Bemis' medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") and three
Amcor medical packaging facilities in the United States ("U.S. Remedy"). The U.S. Remedy was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the Company received $214.2 million
resulting in a gain of $159.1 million. The EC Remedy was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the Company received $397.1 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million
which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings from discontinued operations upon sale of
the EC Remedy.

        In addition, the Company sold an equity method investment acquired through the Bemis acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for proceeds of $27.7 million. There was no gain on sale as
the investment was recorded at fair value upon acquisition.

Note 5 - Discontinued Operations

        On February 11, 2019, the Company received approval from the European Commission ("EC") for the acquisition of Bemis. A condition of the approval was an agreement to divest three Bemis
medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy"). Upon completion of the Bemis acquisition on June 11, 2019, the Company determined that the EC Remedy
met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations." The sale of the EC Remedy closed on August 8, 2019. The Company
recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million, which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings
from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC Remedy.

        The assets and liabilities of the EC Remedy, which is within the Company's Flexibles Segment, are reflected as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2019. Assets and
liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

Note 6 - Restructuring Plans

2019 Bemis Integration Plan

        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As
previously announced, the Company continues to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the
end of fiscal year 2022.

        The Company's total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of
restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses,
$25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200
million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of
which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed
by the end of fiscal year 2022.

        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs
are not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring
related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics and train new employees on relocated equipment.

2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan

        On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the
footprint. The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost
reductions.

        The Company's total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit
manufacturing facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash
impairments. The Company estimates that approximately $65 to $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million.
The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.

2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan

        On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative
was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the
cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.

        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total pre-tax restructuring
costs were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to
dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million total costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4
million. The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.

Other Restructuring Plans

        The Company entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). The Company's restructuring charge related to these Plans was approximately $17.9
million, $18.8 million and $25.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Note 7 - Equity Method Investments

        Investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, with usually not more than 50% voting
interest, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in investments in affiliated companies. Investments in affiliated companies as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 include an interest in AMVIG
Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") of 47.6% and other individually immaterial investments.

        AMVIG is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $0.18 (HKD 1.40) and $0.24 (HKD 1.85), respectively. The value of Amcor's
investment in AMVIG based on its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $77.7 million and $104.8 million, respectively.

        During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company received dividends of $9.8 million, $8.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, from AMVIG.

        The Company reviews its investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Due to
impairment indicators present in each of the years presented, the Company performed an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of its investment in AMVIG to its fair value, which was
determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. The fair value of the investment dropped below its carrying value during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, and therefore the Company recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment of $25.6 million, $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, to bring the value of its investment to fair value. The impairment charge was included in equity in
income (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of income.

Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements

        The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

        The Company's non-derivative financial instruments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term debt and long-term debt. At June 30, 2020 and
2019, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

        Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarchy. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," for information about the Company's fair value hierarchy.

        The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its carrying value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if
available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.

        The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding finance leases) were as follows:

        The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and observed market forward prices discounted at a currency-
specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market-based swap yield curves, considering current interest rates.

        The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities was determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value was determined using the income approach with significant
inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted financial projections. The expected
outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities.

        The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities:

        The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The change in fair value of
the contingent purchase consideration liabilities, which was included in other income, net is due to the passage of time and changes in the probability of achievement used to develop the estimate.

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

        In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S. GAAP.
The Company measures certain assets, including the Company’s equity method investments, technology intangible assets, other intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and
may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.

        The Company tests for impairment of its equity method investments when impairment indicators are present. Impairment tests were performed by comparing the carrying value of the
Company’s investment in AMVIG at the end of each

73

period, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price which is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

        Based on the Company’s evaluation of AMVIG’s current financial condition and the Company’s intent and ability to hold its investment in AMVIG to recover the carrying value, the Company
concluded that the decline in fair value was temporary at March 31, 2020, and therefore no impairment was recorded. However, the quoted share price did not recover in the fiscal fourth quarter and
the Company determined that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of $25.6 million. The Company also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG
investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.

        The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. The
Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million in the fiscal year 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an indefinite-lived technology intangible asset to its fair value. During fiscal
year 2020 and 2018, there were no indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges recorded.

Note 11 - Derivative Instruments

        The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rates, commodity and currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge
or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective.

Interest Rate Risk

        The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging
floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and
interest rate locks.

        For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in
interest expense. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income under other
non-operating income (loss), net.

        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $837.1 million and $841.1 million, respectively.

        At June 30, 2020, the Company had a notional amount of $100 million (equivalent to €89.0 million) cross-currency interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not designate the swaps as
a hedging instrument and thus changes in fair value were immediately recognized in earnings.

        During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into six Treasury lock agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to the highly probable issuance of
long-term debt. The total notional amount of the Treasury lock of $250.0 million was designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction and deemed these agreements to be highly
effective.

        The associated unsecured senior note was issued on June 19, 2020, and the Company has settled these Treasury lock agreements with a $19.8 million cash payment to the counterparties. The loss
associated with the settlement was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the unsecured senior notes, which is 10 years.

Foreign Currency Risk

        The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

        To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into
earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings over
the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated statement of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated
as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

        The Company manages its currency exposure related to the net assets of its foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant currency. Foreign currency gains and
losses from the remeasurement of external borrowings designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in AOCI, to the extent that the hedge is effective. The ineffective
portion is immediately recognized in other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated

75

statement of income. When a hedged net investment is disposed of, a percentage of the cumulative amount recognized in AOCI in relation to the hedged net investment is recognized in the condensed
consolidated statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

        At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, the carrying value of commercial paper issued which is designated as a net investment hedge was $67.0 million. During the three months ended December
31, 2019, the Company settled $67.0 million of U.S. commercial paper issued by a non-U.S. entity, which was previously designated as a net investment hedge in its U.S. subsidiaries. The net
investment hedges recorded through the point of settlement are included in AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the related subsidiaries. The Company did
not have any net investment hedges in place as of June 30, 2020.

Commodity Risk

        Certain raw materials used in the Company's production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable
factors. The Company's policy is to minimize exposure to price volatility by passing through the commodity price risk to customers, including the use of fixed price swaps. The Company purchases
on behalf of customers fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exposure of price volatility on the underlying sales contracts, these instruments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost
or benefit is passed through to customers. Information about commodity price exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and these exposures are hedged by a central treasury
unit. Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the forecast transaction
is realized.

        At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases:

        Where funded, the Company and, in some countries, the employees make cash contributions into the pension fund. In the case of unfunded plans, the Company is responsible for benefit
payments as they fall due. Plan funding requirements are generally determined by local regulation and/or best practice and differ between countries. The local statutory funding positions are not
necessarily consistent with the funded status disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet. For any funded plans in deficit (as measured under local country guidelines), the Company agrees with the
trustees and plan fiduciaries to undertake suitable funding programs to provide additional contributions over time in accordance with local country requirements. Contributions to the Company's
defined benefit pension plans, not including unfunded plans, are expected to be $24.2 million over the next fiscal year.

        The following benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years and thereafter, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

        The ERISA Benefit Plan Committee in the United States, the Pension Plan Committee in Switzerland and the Trustees of the pension plans in Canada, Ireland and UK establish investment
policies and strategies for the Company's pension plan assets and are required to consult with the Company on changes to their investment policy. In developing the expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets' historical returns, asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of
the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return.

Exchange of Notes Related to Bemis Acquisition

        On June 13, 2019, pursuant to terms and conditions of the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, dated as of May 8, 2019, Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. and Bemis Company,
Inc. settled the exchange of various Senior and Guaranteed Senior Notes for new Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Issuers.

        Consent was received from Note holders who tendered approximately 91.7% of Notes across five notes (U.S. dollar notes due 2026 and 2028, and the Bemis Notes due 2019, 2021 and 2026). In
return for the debt exchange, certain indenture terms and conditions were amended and/or removed relating to Bemis Company, Inc.

        Subsequently on April 23, 2020, 99.9% of these Notes were tendered by Note holders and exchanged under a Form S-1 Statement filed March 9, 2020. These Notes have been registered under
the Securities Act, as described in an Exchange Offer Prospectus of the Company dated March 23, 2020.

Guarantees and Financial Covenants

        All the notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain existing subsidiaries that guarantee its
other indebtedness.

        The Company is required to satisfy certain financial covenants pursuant to its bank loans and notes, which are tested as of the last day of each quarterly and annual financial period, including: a)
a leverage ratio, which is calculated as total net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA and b) an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net interest expense, as
defined in the related debt agreements. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

Short-Term Debt

        Short-term debt, which primarily consists of bank loans and bank overdrafts, is generally used to fund working capital requirements. The Company has classified commercial paper as long-term
at June 30, 2020 in accordance with the Company’s ability and intent to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

        The following table summarizes the carrying value of short-term debt at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Forward contracts to purchase own shares

        The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exercised. The Company currently acquires shares on the
open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments. This exposes the Company to market price risk.

        To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has entered into forward contracts
that mature in June 2021 to purchase 2.0 million shares at an average price of $10.68. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding forward contracts for 1.0 million shares at a price of $11.00
that matured in June 2020.

        The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares are classified as a current liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying
value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contract.

        Amcor operates in over forty different jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. The tax expense from operating in non-UK jurisdictions in excess of the UK statutory tax rate is
included in the line "Foreign tax rate differential" in the above tax rate reconciliation table. For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective tax rate was 22.6% as compared to the effective tax rates of
28.4% and 16.4% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal year 2020 foreign tax rate differential reflects a benefit related to Swiss tax law changes, which was mostly offset by current
period tax charges related to true-up adjustments. Refer to the section "Swiss Tax Reform" in this footnote for a discussion of the benefit realized for Swiss tax law changes which the Company
recognized in fiscal year 2020.

        For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective tax rate for the year was higher than its UK statutory tax rate primarily due to pretax income being earned in jurisdictions outside of the UK where
the applicable tax rates are higher than the UK statutory tax rate.

        Deferred tax liabilities relating to other intangible assets is shown net of a deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and
reflected in the balance as at June 30, 2020. A valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset to bring the net amount recorded to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Refer
to the section titled "Swiss Tax Reform" for more information.

        The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in jurisdictions for which it does not believe it is more likely than not to realize those deferred
tax assets based upon all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance, carry-back periods, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies
and earnings expectations. The Company's valuation allowance increased by $72.9 million, increased by $20.4 million and increased by $5.3 million for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform.

        The decrease in deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020 includes the tax impact of the EC Remedy sale of $82.5 million.

        As of June 30, 2020, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effected) and tax credits of approximately $2.9 million that do not expire. The Company has non-UK net operating losses (tax
effected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $50.9 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with these net
operating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which they arose.

        The Company considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements
of the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short term; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings of any subsidiary. The Company has not provided
deferred taxes on approximately $968.2 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Upon distribution of such
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of

95

foreign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liability of $26.9 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely
reinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision
for income or withholding taxes on these earnings.

        The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." At June 30, 2020 and 2019, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $101.1 million and $102.6
million, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

        The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's
accrual for interest and penalties for these uncertain tax positions was $7.1 million, $13.8 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company does not currently anticipate that the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits will result in material changes to its financial position within the next 12 months.

        A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years presented is as follows:

        The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions and, as such, is required to file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions globally. The years 2016 through 2019 remain open
for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the year 2019 remains open for examination by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs ("HMRC") and the years 2011 through
2019 are currently subject to audit or remain open for examination in various U.S. states and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

        The Company believes that its income tax reserves are adequately maintained taking into consideration both the technical merits of its tax return positions and ongoing developments in its
income tax audits. However, the final determination of the Company's tax return positions, if audited, is uncertain and therefore there is a possibility that final resolution of these matters could have a
material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

Swiss Tax Reform

        During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Swiss tax laws were changed in order to remove certain tax regimes and replace these with new measures that are hereafter referred to as "Swiss Tax
Reform." In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company obtained confirmation from local authorities as to the methodology to calculate the future benefits and recorded the impact. The net
impact was a benefit of $21.7 million, which consisted of a reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes.

Note 17 - Share-based Compensation

        The Company's equity incentive plans include grants of share options, restricted shares/units, performance shares, performance rights and share rights to directors, officers and employees. In
certain countries and in selected cases, cash equivalent awards are provided in the event that the issuance of equity awards is not compliant with local legislation and tax laws.

Cash-Settled Awards

        Cash-settled awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company in lieu of, or in addition to, participation in other programs.

        Such awards are accounted for as liabilities and are remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.

        Liabilities for cash-settled share-based compensation are as follows:

        During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company paid $1.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.6 million in cash, respectively, to settle these plans.

Equity-Settled Awards

Share Options

        In fiscal year 2020, share options were granted to officers and employees. The exercise price for shares options was set at the time of grant. There were no share options granted in fiscal year
2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis.

        The requisite service period for outstanding share options in fiscal year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are also subject to performance and market conditions. At vesting, share
options can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to payment of the exercise price. The maximum contractual term of the share options in fiscal year 2020
ranges from five to seven years from the grant date.

        The fair value of the share options granted in fiscal year 2020 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table to produce a
Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of share options granted was estimated using the following assumptions:

Expected dividend yield (%) (1)

Expected share price volatility (%) (2)

Risk-free interest rate (%) (3)

Expected life of options (in years) (4)

(1) Determined assuming no change in dividend payout during the expected term of the option.
(2) Determined based on the observed historical volatility for the Company's ordinary share price.
(3) Determined based on the yields on U.S. Treasury Bonds in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the share options' expected term.
(4) Determined considering the options' contractual terms, historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns.

        The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts compensation expense based on its probability assessment.

$12.3 million on the exercise of stock options during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the intrinsic value

Performance Rights and Performance Shares

        In fiscal year 2020, performance rights or performance shares (awarded to U.S. participants in place of performance rights) were granted to officers and employees. There were no performance
rights or performance shares granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis.

        The requisite service period for outstanding performance rights or performance shares in fiscal year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are also subject to performance and market
conditions. At vesting, performance rights can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Performance shares vest automatically and convert to ordinary shares on a one-
for-one basis. There is no amount payable by the participant.

        The fair value of the performance rights and performance shares granted in fiscal year 2020 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the

Note 18 - Earnings Per Share Computations

        The Company applies the two-class method when computing its earnings per share ("EPS"), which requires that net income per share for each class of share be calculated assuming all of the
Company's net income is distributed as dividends to each class of share based on their contractual rights.

        Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after excluding the ordinary shares to be
repurchased using forward contracts. Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options, restricted shares, performance rights, performance shares and share rights, if dilutive.

Note 19 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings

Contingencies - Brazil

        The Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company will vigorously
defend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to
any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the
liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties
and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of
the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these
matters may differ from the Company's estimates.

        As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 million, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases
referenced above.

Contingencies - Environmental Matters

        The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and
regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially,
cover the total potential exposures. The Company has recorded $17.1 million aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation costs as these sites.

        In addition to the matters described above, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $46.6 million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations
that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.

        While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless,
based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial
condition.

Legal Proceedings

        On April 18, 2019, prior to the closure of the Amcor and Bemis transaction, litigation funding firm, Burford Capital, notified Bemis on behalf of two shareholder funds (BCIM Strategic Value
Master Fund LP and BCIM SV SMA I LLC) that the funds would not accept the fixed exchange ratio for Amcor shares and instead intended to file a case asking a Missouri state court to appraise the
value of their Bemis shares and compensate them accordingly. On June 24, 2019, the Burford funds sent a formal written demand for payment of the fair value of the funds’ shares. On September 6,
2019, the Burford funds filed a Petition for Appraisal of Stock in the Missouri court. On November 4, 2019, Bemis filed an Answer to the Petition for Appraisal of Stock. On June 24, 2020, the
parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release of all claims and two days later the case was dismissed with prejudice.

        Two lawsuits brought by purported holders of Bemis stock against Bemis and Bemis directors and officers are pending in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, in which plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.
Plaintiffs allege a failure to disclose adequately information in the proxy statement issued in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger. The cases are: Dixon, et al. v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al. and
Stein v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al., which were instituted on April 15, 2019 and April 17, 2019, respectively. On March 10, 2020 the federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York consolidated the two pending cases into a single class action.

102

        In addition, a purported holder of Bemis stock filed a putative derivative suit in the Cole County Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial District of Missouri, against Bemis directors and Amcor,
alleging that the directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger and that Amcor aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duty. The case is Scarantino, et al. v. Amcor
Limited, et al., which was instituted on April 19, 2019.

        The Company intends to defend the claims made in the pending actions. It is too early for the Company to provide any reliable assessment of the likely quantum of any damages that may
become payable if its defense is unsuccessful in whole or in part. Although it is not possible at present to establish a reliable assessment of damages, there can be no assurance that any damages that
may be awarded will not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

103

Note 20 - Segments

        The Company's business is organized and presented in the two reportable segments outlined below:

Flexibles: Consists of operations that manufacture flexible and film packaging in the food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, fresh produce, snack food, personal care, and other industries.

Rigid Packaging: Consists of operations that manufacture rigid plastic containers for a broad range of predominantly beverage and food products, including carbonated soft drinks, water, juices,
sports drinks, milk-based beverages, spirits and beer, sauces, dressings, spreads and personal care items and plastic caps for a wide variety of applications.

        Other consists of the Company's equity method investments, including AMVIG, undistributed corporate expenses, intercompany eliminations and other business activities.

        Operating segments are organized along the Company's product lines and geographical areas. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting
structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. The five Flexibles
operating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North America, Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles
reporting segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characteristics and future prospects, similarity in the products they offer, their production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of
their service delivery models, and their regulatory environments.

        In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating income to adjusted
earnings before interest and tax ("Adjusted EBIT") from continuing operations. The Company's chief operating decision maker, the Global Management Team ("GMT"), evaluates performance and
allocates resources based on Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations. The Company defines Adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company
does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies. The GMT consists of the Managing Director and Chief Executive
Officer and his direct reports and provides strategic direction and management oversight of the day to day activities of the Company.

        The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements and are discussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies." The Company
also has investments in operations in AMVIG that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment net sales.

Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

        Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020.
The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal
executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30,
2020 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was identified in our prospectus filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019 and is still being remediated, as described
below.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the "COSO framework" (2013)).

        Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:

•
•

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in
accordance with management and directors of the Company's authorization; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

        A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even
effective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design
and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were
appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information. This control deficiency did not result in a misstatement of our consolidated financial
statements. However, the control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that may have not been prevented or
detected on a timely basis.

113

        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2020 given a previously identified material weakness had not been remediated as of fiscal 2020 year end.

        The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on "Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness

        We are currently in the process of remediating the material weakness related to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over period end reporting through a
process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes the implementation of new
security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on
segregation of duties. Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in
fiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered
remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the
remediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the
severity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19
limitations on travel, meetings and on-site work.

Completed Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness

        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in
technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing requirements. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes
and to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic
registrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced
staff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented
steps and found them to be effective. As a result, we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of June 30, 2020.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

        Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The authorized share capital of Amcor is $100,000,000, divided into 9,000,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.01 par value each and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares of $0.01 par value each, which may be
issued in such class or classes or series as the our board of directors (“board”) may determine in accordance with our Articles of Association. As of August 25, 2020, we had 1,568,481,519 ordinary
shares issued and outstanding.

All ordinary shares have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed income and carry the right to receive dividends that have been declared by Amcor. The holders of ordinary shares have the right to
receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Amcor. The rights and obligations attaching to any preferred shares will be determined at the time of issue by our board in its
absolute discretion and must be set forth in a statement of rights. Any preferred shares that are issued may have priority over the ordinary shares with respect to dividend or liquidation rights or both.
We do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.

Our board may issue ordinary shares or preferred shares without further shareholder action, unless shareholder action is required by applicable law or by the rules of the NYSE, ASX or other stock
exchange or quotation system on which any class or series of our ordinary shares may be listed or quoted.

Subject to our Articles of Association and the rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares, if Amcor is wound up and the property of Amcor available for distribution among the
shareholders is more than sufficient to pay (i) all the debts and liabilities of Amcor and (ii) the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up, the excess must be divided among the shareholders in
proportion to the number of shares held by them, irrespective of the amounts paid or credited as paid on the shares. If Amcor is wound up, the directors or liquidator (as applicable) may, with the
sanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Amcor and any other sanction required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (the “Jersey Companies Law”), divide among the shareholders the
whole or any part of the assets of Amcor and determine how the division will be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.

CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian law which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system. For further information regarding the CDIs, see "—
CHESS Depositary Interests" below. All references to shares in this summary will be deemed, where the context permits, also to be references to the CDIs.

Amcor's registered office address and the address where Amcor's register of members is maintained is 3rd Floor 44 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey JE4 9WG.

Organizational Documents; Governing Law

The rights of Amcor shareholders are governed by, among other things, our Articles of Association and the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, including the Jersey Companies Law.

Voting Rights

Each ordinary share entitles the holder to one vote per share at any general meeting of shareholders. An ordinary resolution requires approval by the holders of a majority of the voting rights
represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. A special resolution requires approval by the holders of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at a meeting, in person or by
proxy, and voting thereon (or such greater majority as the Articles of Association may prescribe).

Voting rights with respect to any class of preferred shares (if any) will be determined by our board and set out in the relevant statement of rights for such class.

Neither Jersey law nor the Articles of Association restrict non-resident shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of our ordinary shares. There are no provisions in the Jersey
Companies Law relating to cumulative voting.

No Preemptive Rights

Amcor shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued ordinary shares.

Variation of Rights

The rights attached to any class of ordinary shares, such as voting, dividends and the like, may, unless their terms of issue state otherwise, be varied by a special resolution passed at a separate
meeting of the holders of shares of such class.

Certificated and Uncertificated Shares

Ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Every holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to have a certificate for the shares that it owns executed under
Amcor's seal or in such other manner as provided by the Jersey Companies Law.

Transfer of Shares

Generally, fully paid ordinary shares are issued in registered form and may be freely transferred pursuant to the Articles of Association unless the transfer is restricted by applicable securities laws or
prohibited by another instrument.

Dividends

Our board may declare and pay any dividends from time to time as it may determine. Our board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it decides, before the payment date, that Amcor's financial
position no longer justifies the payment. The payment of a dividend does not require shareholder confirmation or approval at a general meeting of the shareholders.

Holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to receive equally, on a per share basis, any dividends that may be declared in respect of ordinary shares by our board.

Our board may direct that a dividend will be satisfied from any available source permitted by law, including wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, including paid up shares or securities of
another company. If Amcor declares cash dividends, such dividends will be declared in U.S. dollars.

Under the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source permitted by law (other than from nominal capital account and capital redemption reserve), subject to a requirement for the
directors who are to authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statutory solvency statement.

Our Articles of Association permit our board to require that all dividend payments will be paid only through electronic transfer into an account selected by the shareholder rather than by a bank
check.

No dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share will bear interest as against Amcor (unless the terms of the share specify otherwise).

If any dividend is unclaimed for 11 calendar months after issuance, our board may stop payment on the dividend or otherwise make use of the unclaimed amount for the benefit of Amcor until
claimed or otherwise disposed of according to the laws relating to unclaimed monies.

Alteration of Share Capital

Under the Jersey Companies Law, Amcor may, by special resolution of its shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divide; convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of
its shares into another currency or reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve or share premium account in any way.

Redeemable Shares

Our ordinary shares will not initially be redeemable. Pursuant to the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, our board may issue redeemable shares or convert existing non-
redeemable shares, whether issued or not, into redeemable shares, which shares will be, in each case, redeemable in accordance with their terms or at the option of Amcor and/or at the option of the
holder (provided that an issued non-redeemable share may only be converted into a redeemable share with the agreement of the holder or pursuant to a special resolution).

Purchase of Own Shares

Subject to the provisions of the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, Amcor may purchase its own shares or CDIs and either cancel them or hold them as treasury shares.

Under Jersey law, Amcor's purchase of its own shares must be sanctioned by a special resolution of Amcor's shareholders. If the purchase is to be made on a stock exchange, the special resolution
must specify the maximum number of shares or CDIs to be purchased, the maximum and minimum prices which may be paid, and the date on which the authority to purchase is to expire (which may
not be more than five years after the date of the resolution). If the purchase is to be made otherwise than on a stock exchange, the purchase must be made pursuant to a written purchase contract
approved in advance by a resolution of shareholders (excluding the shareholder from whom Amcor proposes to purchase shares or CDIs).

Shareholder Meetings

Annual Meetings of Shareholders

Under Jersey law, Amcor must hold an annual general meeting once every calendar year and not more than 18 months may elapse between two successive annual general meetings, at such date, time
and place as may be determined by our Board.

A general shareholder meeting may only be called by a resolution of the board or as otherwise provided in the Jersey Companies Law.

Special Meetings of Shareholders

The board may, and upon request of shareholders as required by Jersey law (and as described below) must, convene an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders.

Under the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Amcor holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant meeting may legally require the directors to call a
meeting of shareholders. Upon receiving a requisition notice from shareholders, the board must call a special meeting as soon as practicable but in any case not later than two months after the date of
the requisition. If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of
them representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting so called may not be held after three months from that date.

Notice of Meetings; Record Date

Under the Articles of Association and applicable stock exchange listing rules, the notice for a general meeting must be sent to all shareholders. The content of a notice of a general meeting called by
the board is to be decided by the board, but it must designate the meeting as an annual or extraordinary general meeting and must state the general nature of the business to be transacted at the
meeting and any other matters required by the Jersey Companies Law.

For the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a shareholder to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes such person may cast, Amcor may specify in the notice a date not more
than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date fixed for the meeting, as the date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, attend or vote at the meeting or appoint a
proxy. Amcor may specify a separate time by which a CDI holder must be on the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee (as defined herein) to vote or appoint a proxy.

Quorum

Under the Articles of Association, no business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of shares representing at least the majority of total voting rights of all
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting) is present in person or by proxy at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.

Action by Written Consent

The Articles of Association prohibit actions to be taken by unanimous written consent. Under the Articles of Association, any action required or permitted to be taken by shareholders or any class of
them must be effected at a general meeting of Amcor or of the class in question and may not be effected by any consent or resolution in writing of the shareholders.

Shareholder Proposals

Under Articles of Association, a shareholder of record who has the right to vote at an annual general meeting may, on giving notice to Amcor no more than 120 days and no less than 90 days before
the date which is one year after the date of the previous annual general meeting, require Amcor to include a resolution to be proposed at the annual general meeting. Any proposed business must be a
proper matter for shareholder action.

In addition, a shareholder of record who has the right to vote at general meetings may propose persons for nomination as directors subject to complying with the applicable requirements to be set
forth in the Articles of Association, including delivery to Amcor of specified information on director nominees. Shareholder nominations must be made on notice of (i) in the case of annual general
meetings, no more than 120 calendar days and no less than 90 days (in each case from the anniversary date of the preceding annual general meeting), or (ii) in the case of extraordinary general
meetings called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the 10th day following the day on which notice of the date of such meeting was mailed.

Conditions of Admission

Under the Articles of Association, the board and the chairperson of any general meeting may make any arrangement and impose any requirement or restriction it or he or she considers appropriate to
ensure the safety of persons attending and the orderly conduct of a general meeting including, without limitation, requirements for identification to be produced by those attending the meeting,
searches and the restriction of items that may be taken into the meeting place. The board and, at any general meeting, the chairperson are entitled to refuse entry to a person who refuses to comply
with these arrangements, requirements or restrictions.

Board of Directors

Election of Directors

Amcor directors are appointed by Amcor's board of directors and shall hold office until the next annual general meeting following such appointment. Under the Articles of Association, all directors
are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Directors will hold office until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting following his or her appointment, unless such director is re-elected
at the general meeting.

Where the number of persons validly proposed for election or re-election as a director is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the persons receiving the most votes (up to the number of
directors to be elected) will be elected as directors and an absolute majority of votes cast will not be a pre-requisite to the election of such directors.

Removal of Directors

Under the Articles of Association, a director may only be removed from office by ordinary resolution of Amcor shareholders as a result of:

•

•

the director's conviction (with a plea of nolo contendere deemed to be a conviction) of a serious felony involving moral turpitude or a violation of U.S. federal or state securities law, but
excluding a conviction based entirely on vicarious liability; or
the director's commission of any material act of dishonesty (such as embezzlement) resulting or intended to result in material personal gain or enrichment of the director at the expense of the
Company or any subsidiary and which act, if made the subject to criminal charges, would be reasonably likely to be charged as a felony.

For these purposes nolo contendere, felony and moral turpitude have the meaning given to them by the laws of the United States of America or any relevant state thereof and shall include equivalent
acts in any other jurisdiction.

Vacancies

The Articles of Association provide that any vacancy occurring on the Amcor board (whether caused by increase in size of the Amcor board, or by death, disability, resignation, removal or otherwise)
shall only be filled by a majority of the Amcor board then in office, even though fewer than a quorum.

Any directors appointed by the Amcor board to fill a vacancy will hold office until the next annual general meeting following his or her appointment.

Business Combinations with Interested Shareholders

Under the Articles of Association, Amcor is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with any "interested shareholder" for a period of three years following the time that such
shareholder became an interested shareholder (subject to certain specified exceptions), unless (in addition to other exceptions) prior to such business combination the board approved either the
business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an "interested shareholder."

An "interested shareholder" is (subject to certain specified exceptions) any person (together with its affiliates and associates) that (i) owns more than 15% of Amcor's voting stock or (ii) is an affiliate
or associate of Amcor and owned more than 15% of Amcor's voting stock within three years of the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an "interested shareholder."

Disclosure of Shareholding Ownership

Holders of beneficial interests in Amcor ordinary shares must comply with the beneficial ownership disclosure obligations contained in section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder.

Under the Articles of Association, Amcor may, by written notice, require any person whom Amcor knows or has reasonable cause to believe to hold an interest in Amcor ordinary shares or to have
held an interest at any time during the three years prior, to confirm whether that is the case and give further information as to their interest as requested.

Where a person fails to comply with such notice within the reasonable time period specified in the notice or has made a statement which is false or inadequate, then, unless the Amcor board
determines otherwise, the following restrictions will apply to the applicable shares and to any new shares issued in right of those shares for so long as such person remains in default under the notice:

•

•

•

no voting rights will be exercisable in respect of those shares;

any dividend or other distribution payable in respect of those shares will be withheld by Amcor without interest; and

no transfer of those shares will be registered except for an "excepted transfer".

An "excepted transfer" means a transfer:

•

pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer under the Jersey Companies Law;

• made through the NYSE, ASX or any other stock exchange on which Amcor ordinary shares are normally traded; or

•

of the whole of a person's beneficial interest in the shares to an unaffiliated third party.

CHESS Depositary Interests

CDIs are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by ASX. Ordinary shares are not traded on the financial market operated by the ASX. This is because ASX's electronic settlement system,
known as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issuers, such as Amcor, incorporated in countries whose laws do not recognize CHESS as a system to record uncertificated
holdings or to electronically transfer legal title. CDIs have been created to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for companies in this situation.

CDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultimate beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Amcor. The legal title to these ordinary shares is held by Cede
& Co., with CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd (ABN 75 071 346 506), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASX, which we refer to as the “Depositary Nominee,” holding the beneficial title to those
ordinary shares on behalf of CDI holders.

Each CDI represents a beneficial interest in one ordinary share and, unlike ordinary shares, each CDI can be held, transferred and settled electronically through CHESS.

CDIs are traded electronically on the financial market operated by the ASX. However, there are a number of differences between holding CDIs and ordinary shares. The major differences are that:

•

•

•

CDI holders do not have legal title in the underlying ordinary shares to which the CDIs relate (the chain of title in the ordinary shares underlying the CDIs is summarized above);

CDI holders are not able to vote personally as shareholders at a meeting of Amcor. Instead, CDI holders are provided with a voting instruction form which will enable them to instruct the
Depositary Nominee in relation to the exercise of voting rights. In addition, a CDI holder is able to request the Depositary Nominee to appoint the CDI holder or a third party nominated by
the CDI holder as its proxy so that the proxy so appointed may exercise the votes attaching to the ordinary shares; and

CDI holders will not be directly entitled to certain other rights conferred on holders of ordinary shares, including the right to apply to a Jersey court for an order on the grounds that the affairs
of Amcor are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Amcor shareholders; and the right to apply to the Jersey Financial Services Commission to have an
inspector appointed to investigate the affairs of Amcor.

Alternatively, CDI holders can convert their CDIs into Amcor ordinary shares in sufficient time before the relevant meeting, in which case they will be able to vote personally as shareholders of
Amcor.

Application of Standard Table

The "standard table" of provisions under the Jersey Companies Law does not apply.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

The following description of the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”) issued by Amcor UK Finance plc, a subsidiary of Amcor (the “Issuer”) summarizes certain material terms of the Notes.
This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.26 is a part.

The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 23, 2020 among the Issuer, Amcor, AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis, as guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by an officer's certificate, dated as of June 23, 2020. We refer to the original indenture, as supplemented, as the indenture. The terms of the Notes include
those stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"). A copy of the indenture may be obtained from the Issuer or
the Trustee.

The Issuer issued the Notes in fully registered form in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes were issued in the form of one or more global note,
without coupons, which were deposited initially with, or on behalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, for, and in respect of interests held
through, Euroclear and Clearstream. There is no security register for the Notes in the United Kingdom or

Australia. The Trustee acts as paying agent, transfer agent and registrar for the Notes. The Notes may be presented for registration of transfer and exchange at the offices of the registrar. The Issuer
may change the paying agent, transfer agent and registrar without notice to holders of the Notes, and may change the paying agent upon notice to the Trustee.

General

Unless earlier redeemed in the circumstances set out below, the Notes will mature on June 23, 2027 at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount.

The Notes were offered in the principal amount of €500,000,000.

In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal amount of, or any premium or interest with respect to, the Notes or the date fixed for redemption of the Notes, shall not be a Business
Day, then payment of the principal amount, premium, if any, or interest, including any Additional Amounts (as defined below) payable in respect thereto may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.

The Notes are not entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. The Notes are subject to defeasance as described under "—Defeasance and covenant defeasance.”

Interest

The Notes bear interest from the date of issuance, payable annually on June 23 of each year, beginning June 23, 2021, to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business
on the date that is (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, the clearing system business day (for this purpose, a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear settle payments in euro)
immediately preceding the relevant interest payment and (ii) in all other cases, 15 calendar days prior to the relevant interest payment date (whether or not a Business Day) (for the purposes of clauses
(i) and (ii), such day, the "Record Date"). Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of
days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes (or June 23, 2020, if no interest has been paid on the applicable Notes), to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest
payment date. This payment convention is referred to as Actual/Actual (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.

If any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such interest payment date will be postponed to the next date that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue on the
amounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next Business Day. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from
and after such date to the next Business Day.

Issuance in euro

All payments of interest, premium, if any, and principal, including payments made upon any redemption or repurchase of the Notes, will be made in euro; provided that if the euro is unavailable to us
due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have
adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made
in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, if the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has
not announced a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant
payment date or, in the event The Wall Street Journal has not published such exchange rate, the rate will be determined in our sole discretion on the basis of the most recently available market
exchange rate for the euro. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the indenture). Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent
shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing.

As of August 14, 2020, the rate published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate was €1 = U.S. $1.1833.

Further issues

The indenture provides that the Notes may be issued from time to time without limitation as to aggregate principal amount. Therefore, in the future, the Issuer may, without the consent of the holders
of the Notes, create and issue under the indenture additional debt securities having the same terms and conditions as the Notes (except for the issue date and, under certain circumstances, the first date
of interest accrual, the first interest payment date and terms relating to restrictions on transfer or registration rights), provided that if such additional debt securities are not fungible with the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional debt securities will have a different CUSIP number from the Notes. We refer to any such additional debt securities, as "Additional Notes". Any
Additional Notes of a series will form a single series of debt securities with the Notes.

Guarantee

Under the Guarantee, each of Amcor, Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. (“AFUI”), Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis Company, Inc. (“Bemis,” and collectively, the “Guarantors”) will fully and unconditionally
guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest, premium (if any) and all other amounts due under the indenture and on the Notes when the Notes become due and payable, whether
at maturity, pursuant to optional redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, in each case after any applicable grace periods or notice requirements, according to the terms of the Notes.

The obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantee are unconditional, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be discharged until all obligations under the Notes and the
indenture are satisfied. Holders of the Notes may proceed directly against the Guarantors under the Guarantee if an event of default affecting the Notes occurs without first proceeding against the
Issuer.

Additional subsidiary guarantors

Amcor has covenanted and agreed under the indenture that it will cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer and any Subsidiary that is already a Guarantor under the indenture) that at any
time has outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Indebtedness, or is otherwise an obligor, a co-obligor or jointly liable with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor with respect to any
Specified Indebtedness, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture within 30 days of such Subsidiary guaranteeing, or otherwise becoming an obligor, a co-obligor or jointly liable
with the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor in respect of, such Specified Indebtedness, pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee the Notes issued under the indenture on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions and limitations as set forth in the indenture.

Any supplemental indenture entered into in accordance with the indenture in connection with the provision of a Guarantee by an additional Subsidiary Guarantor may include a limitation on such
Subsidiary Guarantee that is required under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is incorporated or organized, provided that such limitation shall also be contained in any other
guarantee provided by such Subsidiary in respect of any Specified Indebtedness.

Release of subsidiary guarantors

As more fully described in the indenture, any Subsidiary of Amcor that provides a Guarantee in respect of the Notes (a "Subsidiary Guarantor") may be released at any time from its Guarantee
without the consent of any holder of the Notes if, at such time, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and either (a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer, or at the time of
release will no longer be, a Subsidiary of Amcor or (b) such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have outstanding a guarantee with respect to any Specified Indebtedness or otherwise be an obligor, co-
obligor or jointly liable with respect to any Specified Indebtedness (or shall be released with respect to its Guarantee under the indenture simultaneously with its release under guarantees or other
obligations with respect to all Specified Indebtedness).

Ranking

The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank on a parity basis with all of the Issuer's other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, and each of the Guarantees are an unsecured
obligation of the applicable Guarantor and rank on a parity basis with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor except, in each case, indebtedness mandatorily preferred
by law.

The Notes are effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing any such obligations, and since the Notes are
unsecured obligations of the Issuer, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, the Issuer's secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral securing the obligations owed to them.
Each of the Guarantees are effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations, and
since each of the Guarantees is an unsecured obligation of the corresponding Guarantor, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, each such Guarantor's secured lenders will have a prior secured
claim to any collateral securing the obligation owed to them. As of June 30, 2020, the Issuer and the Guarantors had no secured indebtedness outstanding.

The Notes and each of the related Guarantees are also be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, whether or not secured, of any Subsidiary of Amcor
(other than Amcor UK) that does not guarantee such Notes (including any subsidiaries that Amcor may in the future acquire or establish to the extent they do not guarantee such Notes). Amcor,
AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis are the initial Guarantors of the Notes. See "—Guarantees."

As of June 30, 2020, (i) the Issuer and the Guarantors had $6,129.8 million in aggregate principal amount of total indebtedness, other than intercompany indebtedness (of which none was secured)
and (ii) the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including joint ventures, had $104.8 million of total indebtedness (of which $30.5 million was secured). For the year ended June 30, 2020, the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, including joint ventures, represented 93% of Amcor's sales revenue.

Registration of transfer and exchange

General

Subject to the limitations applicable to global notes, the Notes may be presented for exchange for other Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like tenor and aggregate principal amount or
for registration of transfer by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing and, if so required by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee, with the form of transfer thereon duly
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Registrar (as defined below) duly executed, at the office of the Registrar or at the
office of any other transfer agent designated by the Issuer or such Guarantors for such purpose. No service charge will be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of the Notes, but the Issuer
or the Guarantors may require payment of a sum by the holder of a Note sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Such transfer or exchange will be effected upon the Registrar or such transfer agent, as the case may be, being satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person making the request. The
Registrar may decline to accept any request for an exchange or registration of transfer of any Note during the period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment of interest on, principal of or
any other payments on or in respect of the Notes. The Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed the Trustee as Registrar (the "Registrar"). The Issuer and the Guarantors may at any time designate
additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts; provided, however, that there shall at all times be a
transfer agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.

Payment of additional amounts

All payments of, or in respect of, principal of, and any premium and interest on, the Notes, and all payments pursuant to the Guarantees, shall be made without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the United States (including the District of Columbia and
any state, possession or territory thereof), Jersey, Australia, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or the Guarantors becomes a resident for tax purposes (whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise) or through which the Issuer or any Guarantor makes payment on the Notes or any Guarantee (each, a "Relevant Jurisdiction") or any political subdivision or taxing
authority of any of the foregoing, unless such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges are required by the law of the Relevant Jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein to be withheld or deducted. In that event, the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges and any additional taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges payable in respect of such Additional Amounts) in the payment to the holder
of the Notes of the amounts which would have been payable in respect of such Notes or Guarantee had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no Additional Amounts shall be so
payable for or on account of:

(1) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the fact that such holder or beneficial owner of the Notes:

(a) is or was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment or is or was physically present in, the United States, Jersey, Australia, the
United Kingdom, or other Relevant Jurisdiction or otherwise had some connection with the United States, Jersey, Australia, the United Kingdom, or other Relevant Jurisdiction other than the
mere ownership of, or receipt of payment under, such Notes or Guarantee;

(b) presented such Note or Guarantee for payment in any Relevant Jurisdiction, unless such Note or Guarantee could not have been presented for payment elsewhere;

(c) presented such Note or Guarantee (where presentation is required) more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the payment in respect of such Note or Guarantee first became due
and payable or provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts if it had presented such Note or Guarantee for
payment on any day within such period of thirty (30) days; or

(d) with respect to any withholding or deduction of taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed by the United States, or any of its territories or any political subdivision
thereof or any taxing authority thereof or therein, is or was with respect to the United States a citizen or resident of the United States, treated as a resident of the United States, present in the
United States, engaged in business in the United States, a person with a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States, a "ten percent shareholder" of the Issuer or the
Guarantors, a passive foreign investment company, or a controlled foreign corporation, or has or has had some other connection with the United States (other than the mere receipt of a
payment or the ownership of holding a Note;

(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any withholding or deduction on account of such tax, assessment or other
government charge;

(3) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments of (or in respect of) principal of, or any premium and interest
on, the Notes or the Guarantees thereof;

(4) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to comply in a timely manner by the holder of such Note or, in
the case of a global security, the beneficial owner of such Global Note, with a timely request of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any Paying Agent addressed to such holder or beneficial
owner, as the case may be, (a) to provide information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of such holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to make any declaration or other similar claim or
satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which, in the case of (a) or (b), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of any Relevant Jurisdiction or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge
(including without limitation the filing of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-9);

(5) any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is imposed or withheld by or by reason of the Australian Commissioner of Taxation giving a notice under
section 255 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) of Australia or section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) of Australia or under a similar provision;

(6) any taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes to comply with (a) the requirements of Sections 1471 through 1474 (commonly known as
"FATCA") of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as of the date hereof (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more
onerous to comply with), the U.S. Treasury regulations issued thereunder or any official interpretation thereof or any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471 of the Code, (b) any treaty, law,
regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction or relating to any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction, which, in either case,
facilitates the implementation of clause (a) above and (c) any agreement pursuant to the implementation of clauses (a) and (b) above with the IRS, the U.S. government or any governmental or
taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; or

(7) any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6);

nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any such Note or Guarantee to any such holder who is a
fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such Note or Guarantee would, under the laws of any Relevant Jurisdiction or any political

subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, be treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a
beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had it been the holder of the Note or Guarantee.

Whenever there is mentioned, in any context, any payment of or in respect of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Notes (or any payments pursuant to the Guarantees thereof), such
mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in the indenture to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the indenture, and any express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts in any provisions of the indenture shall not be construed as excluding Additional
Amounts in those provisions of the indenture where such express mention is not made.

Certain other additional amounts may be payable in respect of Notes and Guarantees as a result of certain consolidations or mergers involving, or conveyances, transfer or leases of properties and
assets by, the Issuer or the Guarantors. See "—Certain covenants—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets.”

Amcor's obligations to pay Additional Amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indenture and the payment of all other amounts in respect of the Notes.

Redemption for changes in withholding taxes

If, as the result of (a) any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations, published practice or published tax rulings of any Relevant Jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation, or (b) any change in the official administration, application, or interpretation by a relevant court or tribunal, government or government authority of any
Relevant Jurisdiction of such laws, regulations, published practice or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Notes or the Guarantees, which change or amendment becomes
effective on or after the later of (x) the original issue date of the Notes or the Guarantees or (y) the date on which a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction (whether by consolidation, merger or
transfer of assets of the Issuer or any Guarantor, change in place of payment on the Notes or any Guarantee or otherwise) or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall
not have been available to the public prior to such later date, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors would be required to pay any Additional Amounts pursuant to the indenture or the terms of any
Guarantee in respect of interest on the next succeeding interest payment date (assuming, in the case of the Guarantors, a payment in respect of such interest was required to be made by the applicable
Guarantor under the Guarantee thereof on such interest payment date and the applicable Guarantor would be unable, for reasons outside their control, to procure payment by the Issuer), and the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all
(but not less than all) of the corresponding Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' written notice as provided in the indenture (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, to and
through Euroclear or Clearstream for communication by them to the holders of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the case of definitive Notes, to each holder of record of the Notes to
be redeemed at its registered address, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that:

(1) no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were
a payment in respect of the Notes or the applicable Guarantee thereof then due; and

(2) at the time any such redemption notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts must remain in effect.

Prior to any such redemption, the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or any Person with whom the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor has consolidated or merged, or to whom the Issuer or the applicable
Guarantor has conveyed or transferred or leased all or substantially all of its properties and assets (the successor Person in any such transaction, a "Successor Person"), as the case may be, shall
provide the Trustee with an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conditions precedent to such redemption have occurred and a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by taking measures that the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or the Successor Person, as the case may be, believes are commercially reasonable.

Optional redemption

The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Issuer at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and
(2) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined

below), the sum of (a) the present value of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (b) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest thereon (not including any
portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) from the redemption date to the maturity date of the Note being redeemed, in each case, discounted to the date of redemption
on an annual basis (Actual/Actual ICMA) at the Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points (0.300%), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
date of redemption; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer redeems any of the Notes on or after the Par Call Date (as defined below), such Notes are redeemable at the
Issuer's option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of such Notes being redeemed to such
date of redemption.

The principal amount of any Note remaining outstanding after a redemption in part shall be €100,000 or a higher integral multiple of €1,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on
Notes that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders of Notes as of the close of
business on the relevant record date according to the Notes and the indenture.

"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us (the "Quotation
Agent"), a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the par call date, or if such Quotation Agent in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German
government bond as such Quotation Agent may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining
the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

"Comparable Government Bond Rate" means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the
Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such Business Day
of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by
the Quotation Agent selected by us.

"Par Call Date" means April 23, 2027.

Notice of any redemption will be provided at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed (i) in the case of Notes represented by a
global note, to and through Euroclear or Clearstream for communication by them to the holders of interests in the Notes to be so redeemed, or (ii) in the case of definitive Notes, by mail to each
holder of record of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price and accrued interest, on and after the redemption date, interest will
cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

If less than all of the Notes are being redeemed, the Notes for redemption will be selected as follows:

•

•

if the Notes are held through Euroclear or Clearstream, in compliance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream; or

if the Notes are not held through any clearing system, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.

The Trustee may select for redemption the Notes and portions of the Notes in amounts of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Governing law

The indenture and the Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Concerning our relationship with the trustee

The Issuer and the Guarantors have commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, or "Deutsche Bank," and may have borrowed money from
Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the normal course of business. The Issuer and the Guarantors may enter into similar or other banking relationships with Deutsche Bank or its affiliates in the future in
the normal course of business. Deutsche Bank may also act as trustee with respect to other debt securities issued by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

Offers to purchase; open market purchases

Neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors is required to make any sinking fund payments or any offers to purchase with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees. The Issuer or the Guarantors may at
any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

Certain covenants

Pursuant to the indenture, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors have covenanted and agreed as follows.

Offer to repurchase upon change of control triggering event

The indenture provides that, upon the occurrence of a Change Of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes in accordance with their terms, each holder of
the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date.

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, or at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the
pending Change of Control, the Issuer will be required to send, by first class mail, a notice to each holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of
Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be
required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned
on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Holders of Notes electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender their Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Trustee at the address specified in the notice, or transfer
their Notes to the Trustee by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Trustee, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment
Date.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer
made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all corresponding Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of our assets and the assets of
our subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that the Issuer offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another "person" (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) may be uncertain.

Limitation on liens

Pursuant to the indenture, for so long as any of the Notes or any of the Guarantees are outstanding, Amcor will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur, issue or otherwise
have outstanding any Lien upon, or with respect to, any of the present or future business, property, undertaking, assets or revenues (including, without limitation, any Equity Interests and uncalled
capital), whether now owned or hereafter acquired (together, "assets") of Amcor or such Subsidiary, to secure any Indebtedness, unless the Notes and applicable Guarantees are secured by such Lien
equally and ratably with (or prior to) such Indebtedness, except for the following, to which this covenant shall not apply:

(a) Liens on assets securing Indebtedness of Amcor or such Subsidiary outstanding on the date of the indenture;

(b) Liens on assets securing Indebtedness owing to Amcor or any Subsidiary (other than a Project Subsidiary);

(c) Liens existing on any asset prior to the acquisition of such asset by Amcor or any Subsidiary after the original issue date of the Notes, provided that (i) such Lien has not been created in
anticipation of such asset being so acquired, (ii) such Lien shall

not apply to any other asset of Amcor or any Subsidiary, other than to proceeds and products of, and, in the case of any assets other than Equity Interests, after-acquired property that is affixed or
incorporated into, the assets covered by such Lien on the date of such acquisition of such assets, (iii) such Lien shall secure only the Indebtedness secured by such Lien on the date of such acquisition
of such asset and (iv) such Lien shall be discharged within one year of the date of acquisition of such asset or such later date as may be the date of the maturity of the Indebtedness that such Lien
secures if such Indebtedness is fixed interest rate indebtedness that provides a commercial financial advantage to Amcor and the Subsidiaries;

(d) Liens on any assets of a Person that becomes a Subsidiary (or of any Person not previously a Subsidiary that is merged or consolidated with or into a Subsidiary) after the original issue date of the
Notes that existed prior to the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary (or is so merged or consolidated), provided that (i) such Lien has not been created in anticipation of such Person becoming a
Subsidiary (or such merger or consolidation), (ii) such Lien shall not apply to any other asset of Amcor or any Subsidiary, other than to proceeds and products of, and, in the case of any assets other
than Equity Interests, after-acquired property that is affixed or incorporated into, the assets covered by such Lien on the date such Person becomes a Subsidiary (or is so merged or consolidated), (iii)
such Lien shall secure only the Indebtedness secured by such Lien on the date such Person becomes a Subsidiary (or is so merged or consolidated) and (iv) such Lien shall be discharged within one
year of the date such Person becomes a Subsidiary (or is so merged or consolidated) or such later date as may be the date of the maturity of the Indebtedness that such Lien secures if such
Indebtedness is fixed interest rate indebtedness that provides a commercial financial advantage to Amcor and the Subsidiaries;

(e) Liens created to secure Indebtedness, directly or indirectly, incurred for the purpose of purchasing Equity Interests or other assets (other than real or personal property of the type contemplated by
clause (f) below), provided that (i) such Lien shall secure only such Indebtedness incurred for the purpose of purchasing such assets, (ii) such Lien shall apply only to the assets so purchased (and to
proceeds and products of, and, in the case of any assets other than Equity Interests, any subsequently after-acquired property that is affixed or incorporated into, the assets so purchased) and (iii) such
Lien shall be discharged within two years of such Lien being granted;

(f) Liens created to secure Indebtedness incurred for the purpose of acquiring or developing any real or personal property or for some other purpose in connection with the acquisition or development
of such property, provided that (i) such Lien shall secure only such Indebtedness,

(ii) such Lien shall not apply to any other assets of Amcor or any Subsidiary, other than to proceeds and products of, and after-acquired property that is affixed or incorporated into, the property so
acquired or developed and (iii) the rights of the holder of the Indebtedness secured by such Lien shall be limited to the property that is subject to such Lien, it being the intention that the holder of
such Lien shall not have any recourse to Amcor or any Subsidiaries personally or to any other property of Amcor or any Subsidiary;

(g) Liens for any borrowings from any financial institution for the purpose of financing any import or export contract in respect of which any part of the price receivable is guaranteed or insured by
such financial institution carrying on an export credit guarantee or insurance business, provided that (i) such Lien applies only to the assets that are the subject of such import or export contract and
(ii) the amount of Indebtedness secured thereby does not exceed the amount so guaranteed or insured;

(h) Liens for Indebtedness from an international or governmental development agency or authority to finance the development of a specific project, provided that (i) such Lien is required by
applicable law or practice and (ii) the Lien is created only over assets used in or derived from the development of such project;

(i) any Lien created in favor of co-venturers of Amcor or any Subsidiary pursuant to any agreement relating to an unincorporated joint venture, provided that (i) such Lien applies only to the Equity
Interests in, or the assets of, such unincorporated joint venture and (ii) such Lien secures solely the payment of obligations arising under such agreement;

(j) Liens over goods and products, or documents of title to goods and products, arising in the ordinary course of business in connection with letters of credit and similar transactions, provided that
such Liens secure only the acquisition cost or selling price (and amounts incidental thereto) of such goods and products required to be paid within 180 days;

(k) Liens arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business of Amcor or any Subsidiary;

(l) Liens created by Amcor or any Subsidiary over a Project Asset of Amcor or such Subsidiary, provided that such Lien secures only (i) in the case of a Lien over assets referred to in clause (a) of the
definition of Project Assets, Limited Recourse

Indebtedness incurred by Amcor or such Subsidiary or (ii) in the case of a Lien over Equity Interests referred to in clause (b) of the definition of Project Assets, Limited Recourse Indebtedness
incurred by the direct Subsidiary of Amcor or such Subsidiary;

(m) Liens arising under any netting or set-off arrangement entered into by Amcor or any Subsidiary in the ordinary course of its banking arrangements for the purpose of netting debit and credit
balances of Amcor or any Subsidiary;

(n) Liens incurred in connection with any extension, renewal, replacement or refunding (together, a "refinancing") of any Lien permitted in clauses (a) through (m) above and any successive
refinancings thereof permitted by this clause (n) (each an "Existing Security"), provided that (i) such Liens do not extend to any asset that was not expressed to be subject to the Existing Security, (ii)
the principal amount of Indebtedness secured by such Liens does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness that was outstanding and secured by the Existing Security at the time of such
refinancing and (iii) any refinancing of an Existing Security incurred in accordance with clauses (c) through (e) above (and any subsequent refinancings thereof permitted by this clause (n)) will not
affect the obligation to discharge such Liens within the time frames that applied to such Existing Security at the time it was first incurred (as specified in the applicable clause);

(o) any Lien arising as a result of a Change in Lease Accounting Standard; and

(p) other Liens by Amcor or any Subsidiary securing Indebtedness, provided that, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence or assumption of any such Lien or the incurrence of any
Indebtedness secured thereby, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Indebtedness of Amcor and any Subsidiary secured by any Liens pursuant to this clause (p) shall not exceed 10% of
Total Tangible Assets at such time.

There are no restrictions in the indenture limiting the amount of unsecured Indebtedness that Amcor or any of its Subsidiaries may have outstanding at any time.

Consolidation, merger and sale of assets

The indenture provides that for so long as any of the Notes of any series issued thereunder or Guarantees thereunder are outstanding, neither the Issuer nor any applicable Guarantor may consolidate
with or merge into any other Person that is not the Issuer or an applicable Guarantor, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person that is not the Issuer or
an applicable Guarantor, unless:

(1) any Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is merged or to whom the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, has conveyed,
transferred or leased all or substantially all of its properties and assets is a corporation, partnership or trust organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and such
Person either is the Issuer or any other applicable Guarantor or assumes by supplemental indenture the Issuer's or such Guarantor's obligations, as the case may be, on such Notes or such Guarantees,
as applicable, and under the indenture (including any obligation to pay any Additional Amounts);

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any applicable Guarantor as a result of such transaction as having
been incurred at the time of such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be
continuing;

(3) any such Person not incorporated or organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, Jersey, the Commonwealth of Australia or the
United Kingdom or any state or territory thereof shall expressly agree by a supplemental indenture,

(a) to indemnify the holder of each such Note and each beneficial owner of an interest therein against (X) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on such holder or
beneficial owner or required to be withheld or deducted from any, payment to such holder or beneficial owner as a consequence of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease,
and (Y) any costs or expenses of the act of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, and

(b) that all payments pursuant to such Notes or such Guarantees in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Notes, as the case may be, shall be made without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the
jurisdiction of organization or residency of such Person or any political subdivision or taxing authority

thereof or therein, unless such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges are required by such jurisdiction or any such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which
case such Person will pay such additional amounts ("Successor Additional Amounts") as will result (after deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges and any
additional taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges payable in respect of such) in the payment to each holder or beneficial owner of a Note of such series of the amounts which
would have been received pursuant to such Notes or such Guarantees, as the case may be, had no such withholding or deduction been required, subject to the same exceptions as would apply
with respect to the payment by the applicable Issuer or the applicable Guarantors of Additional Amounts in respect of such Notes or such Guarantees (substituting the jurisdiction of
organization of such Person for any Relevant Jurisdiction) (see "—Payment of additional amounts"); and

(4) certain other conditions are met.

The foregoing provisions would not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of highly leveraged or other transactions involving the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors that may
adversely affect holders of the Notes.

Modification and waiver

There are three types of changes the Issuer can make to the indenture and the Notes.

Changes requiring unanimous approval

First, there are the following changes, which the Issuer cannot make to the Notes or the indenture without the specific consent of the holder of each Note affected thereby:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Change the stated maturity of, or any installment of, the principal, premium (if any) or interest on the Notes or the rate of interest on the Notes or change the Issuer’s obligation to pay
Additional Amounts on the Notes, as described above under the section entitled "—Payment of additional amounts."

Change the place or currency of payment on the Notes.

Impair the ability of any holder of the Notes of such series to sue for payment.

Reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Notes following an Event of Default.

Reduce any amounts due on the Notes.

Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the holders of which is needed to modify or amend the indenture.

Reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes the consent of the holders of which is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the indenture or to waive certain defaults.

• Modify in a way that adversely affects holders any other aspect of the provisions dealing with modification or waiver under the indenture.

• Modify in a way that adversely affects holders the terms and conditions of the applicable Guarantors' payment obligations (including with respect to Additional Amounts) under the Notes.

• Waive a default or an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a

majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration).

•

•

Subordinate the Notes or the Guarantees thereof to any other obligation of the Issuer or any of the applicable Guarantors.

Release any applicable Guarantee (other than in accordance with the indenture).

•

Change any of the provisions set forth above requiring the consent of the holders of the Notes.

Changes requiring majority approval

With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding the Notes affected thereby, the Issuer and the Trustee may modify the indenture or the
Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such
Notes; provided that the Issuer cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or any change in respect of the indenture or the Notes listed under "—Changes requiring unanimous approval" without the
consent of each holder of the Notes to such waiver or change.

Changes not requiring approval

The third type of change does not require any vote or consent by holders of the Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other changes as specified in the indenture that would not
adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect.

Further details concerning voting / consenting

When taking a vote or obtaining a consent, the Issuer will use the principal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date, if the maturity of the corresponding Notes were accelerated to
that date because of an Event of Default.

Notes will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if the Issuer has deposited or set aside in trust for you money for their payment or redemption, or if such Notes have been
cancelled by the Trustee or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

The Issuer will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding Notes that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indenture. In
certain limited circumstances, the Trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders of the Notes. If the Issuer or the Trustee sets a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by
holders of the Notes, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of such Notes on the record date and must be taken within 180 days following the record date or a shorter
period that the Issuer may specify (or as the Trustee may specify, if it set the record date). The Issuer may shorten or lengthen (but not beyond 180 days) this period from time to time.

Satisfaction and discharge

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all debt securities issued thereunder, when:

•

either:

◦

◦

all debt securities under the indenture that have been authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed debt securities under the indenture that have been replaced or paid
and applicable series of debt securities for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the applicable issuer or discharged from such trust, have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

In addition, the applicable issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate of one of its responsible officers and an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

Defeasance and covenant defeasance

The indenture provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors, at the Issuer’s or the applicable Guarantor(s)'s option with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees:

(1) will be deemed to have been discharged from their respective obligations in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations to register the transfer of or exchange the Notes, to replace stolen,
lost, destroyed or mutilated Notes upon satisfaction of certain requirements (including, without limitation; providing such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors
may require) and except obligations to pay all amounts due and owing to the Trustee under the indenture), to maintain paying agents and to hold certain moneys in trust for payment); or

(2) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the indenture (including those described under "—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens" and "—certain Covenants—Consolidation,
merger and sale of assets"),
in each case if the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors deposit in trust with the Trustee (i) money in an amount, (ii) U.S. Government Obligations that through the scheduled payment of principal and
interest in respect of the Notes in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case
sufficient to pay all the principal of, and any premium and interest (and any Additional Amounts then known) on the Notes, on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the
indenture.
In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (1) above, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that (a) the Issuer or
the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, has received from, or there has been published by, the IRS, a ruling or (b) since the original issue date of the Notes, there has been a change in the
applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that the holders of the Notes will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise of the
option under clause (1) above and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been
exercised. In the case of discharge pursuant to clause (2) above, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantors, as the case may be, is required to deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the
holders of the Notes will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise of the option under clause (2) above and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had not been exercised.

Guarantees

Under each Guarantee, each Guarantor unconditionally guaranteed the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest (if any), premium (if any) and all other amounts due on the Notes and under
the applicable indenture when the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, pursuant to mandatory or optional redemption or repayments, by acceleration or otherwise, in each case
after any applicable grace periods or notice requirements, according to the terms of the Notes.
The obligations of each Guarantor under the Guarantees are unconditional, regardless of the enforceability of the Notes, and will not be discharged until all obligations under the Notes and the
applicable indenture are satisfied. Holders of the applicable Notes may proceed directly against the applicable Guarantor under the applicable Guarantee if an event of default affecting those Notes
occurs without first proceeding against the Issuer.

Fraudulent conveyance or transfer considerations

England and wales

Under English insolvency law, if a company enters administration or goes into liquidation, then the administrator or liquidator, as applicable, has certain powers to, among other things, apply to the
court for such order as the court sees fit (including an

order to set aside any transaction) to restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into a transaction with any person at an "undervalue" (as described in the UK
Insolvency Act 1986) if the transaction was entered into at a time in the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction might be at an "undervalue" if the company makes a gift
to or otherwise receives no consideration from another party or receives consideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly lower than the value of the consideration given
by the company. A court generally will not intervene, however, if the company entered into a transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and, at the time it did so, there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company.

Additionally, if the liquidator or administrator can show that a "preference" was given by a company at a time in the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (or two years if the
preference is to a connected person), a court can make such order as it see fits to restore the position to what it would have been had the preference not been given (including an order to set aside any
transaction). Generally, a company gives a preference to a person if it does anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting a person who is one of the company's creditors,
sureties or guarantors in a position which, in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have been in had that thing not been done.

A court will only make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue or a preference if, at the time of the relevant transaction or preference, the company was insolvent within the meaning of
the UK Insolvency Act 1986 or became insolvent as a consequence of the transaction or preference. Further, a court will not make an order in respect of a preference to a person unless the company
was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to improve that person's position in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation than if that thing had not been done, though this
desire is presumed where the preference is to a connected person.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach, or otherwise prejudicing the
interests, of persons who might claim against it, then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been had the transaction not been entered into
(including an order to set aside any transaction) and for protecting the interests of "victims" of the transaction. Any person who is such a "victim" of the transaction (with the leave of the court), as
well as the administrator or liquidator of the company, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made, other than relevant limitation periods, and the
company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction or in liquidation or administration.

Australia

Under Australian insolvency laws, a guarantee may not be enforceable against a guarantor if a court were to find, in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (a) that the guarantor was insolvent
(unable to pay its debts as they become due) at the time it provided its guarantee or was rendered insolvent by virtue of giving such guarantee and (b) upon application of a liquidator, where the
winding up has begun within four years of the issuance of such guarantee, that the issuance of such guarantee was an "uncommercial transaction" under the Australian Act, which determination
would be based upon a conclusion that a reasonable person in such guarantor's circumstances would not have issued such guarantee after consideration of (i) the benefits, if any, realized by such
guarantor of issuing such guarantee, (ii) the detriment to such guarantor of issuing such guarantee, (iii) the respective benefits realized by other parties to the transaction, and (iv) any other fact that a
reasonable person would consider relevant in connection with making such determination.

United States

Under United States bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee can be voided, or claims under a guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that
guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:

•

intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the guarantee;

• was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

• was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor's remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

•

intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature.

In addition, any payment by that guarantor under a guarantee could be voided and required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the governing law. Generally, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets;

the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required, to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

it could not pay its debts as they become due.

Jersey

Under Article 17 of the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the "Jersey Bankruptcy Law") and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on the application of the
Viscount of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property has been declared "en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding up, a procedure which is instigated by shareholders not
creditors), set aside a guarantee entered into by a company with any person at an undervalue. There is a five year look back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of
"désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the Viscount of Jersey or liquidator to demonstrate that the
Jersey company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person or associate of the company, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person
must demonstrate the Jersey company was not insolvent when it entered the transaction in such proceedings.

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on the application of the Viscount of Jersey (in the case of a company whose property
has been declared "en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding up), set aside a preference (including a guarantee) given by the company to any person. There is a 12 month look
back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of "désastre" during which guarantees are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule.

A guarantee will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Jersey company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company's debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the
event of the company going into an insolvent winding up) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that
the guarantee constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given. However, for the court to do so,
it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Jersey company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the Viscount of Jersey or
liquidator to demonstrate that the Jersey company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the
guarantee was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in
such proceedings that the company was not influenced by such a desire.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention
of defeating creditors' claims may be set aside.

Following the stock purchase of Schmalbach-Lubeca Plastic Containers USA, Inc. by Amcor Limited and Twinpack (USA) Inc. on October 24, 2002, the name of the company was changed to Amcor PET Packaging USA, Inc. and this plan became known as the Amcor PET Packaging Deferred Compensation Plan. The Plan was amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2005 to comply with Section 409A of the Code and to make various other Plan design changes. It is the intent of the Company that all contributions described in Section 4 hereunder and allocated to a Participant’s Accounts in accordance with Section 5 that are attributable to services performed for the Employer on and after January 1, 2005 will be subject to, and comply with, Section 409A of the Code. Amounts deferred under the Plan that are attributable to services performed for the Employer prior to January 1, 2005 will be grandfathered and will be governed by the Plan provisions in effect prior to January 1, 2005. On March 5, 2010, Amcor PET Packaging USA, Inc. changed its name to Amcor Rigid Plastics USA, Inc. On January 1, 2011, the Plan changed its name to the Amcor Rigid Plastics Deferred Compensation Plan. The Plan as set forth herein is an amendment and restatement effective as of January 1, 2013. 1.2 Purpose The Plan is maintained for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management and highly compensated key employees of the Company.

SECTION 3 Eligibility and Participation 3.1 Eligibility Each Plan Year, the Committee will determine those Employees who are Eligible Employees. Eligible Employee generally means an Employee of an Employer whose annualized base compensation and bonus is expected to exceed the limitations of Section 414(q) of the Code ($105,000, as adjusted from time to time) in the current year and who is considered part of key management personnel. An Employee may be an Eligible Employee to make Employee Contributions, to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions, to receive Employer Special Contributions, or to receive Employer 10% Target Contributions, as the Committee determines. 3.2 Participation An Eligible Employee who is selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan shall commence participation in the Plan as of the later of the Eligible Employee’s designation as an Eligible Employee or the date an Eligible Employee elects to make Employee Contributions. An Eligible Employee may elect to make Employee Contributions to the Plan by filing an election with the Committee in accordance with Section 4. Once an Eligible Employee makes an election, the election remains in effect in accordance with Section 4. An Eligible Employee who is selected to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions, Employer Special Contributions, and/or Employer 10% Target Contributions shall commence participation in the Plan as of the Eligible Employee’s designation as an Eligible Employee. The fact that a Participant is eligible to make Employee Contributions or to receive Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions, Employer Special Contributions, and/or Employer 10% Target Contributions (or a certain level of Employer Contributions) in one Plan Year does not
guarantee the Participant the right to make or receive such Employee Contributions or Employer Contributions (or level of Employer Contributions) in any other Plan Year. The Committee may terminate or suspend the participation of any Eligible Employee at any time. However, except as provided in subsections 5.1 and 5.2, a Participant’s suspension or termination from the Plan shall not reduce the Account balances of a Participant. An Eligible Employee shall cease to be a Participant when the Eligible Employee’s employment is terminated with all Employers and their Affiliates and the Eligible Employee’s vested Account balance is distributed to the Eligible Employee or the Eligible Employee’s Beneficiaries. -7-

SECTION 4 Contributions 4.1 Long-Term Incentive Plan Contributions Prior to January 1, 2005, the Employers maintained the Amcor PET Packaging USA, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). An Eligible Employee who received long-term incentive awards from the LTIP may have elected to defer all or a portion of such awards into the Plan on or after the Plan’s Original Effective Date. An Eligible Employee also may have elected to defer into the Plan, by September 30, 2000, a stock appreciation rights payment from the LTIP received as a result of a change in control. Any such long-term incentive or stock appreciation rights contributions are part of a Participant’s Grandfathered Account. 4.2 Salary Deferral Contributions The Plan permits Salary Deferral Contributions of between 1% and 50% of an Eligible Employee’s Compensation. A newly designated Eligible Employee who is selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan may elect to make Salary Deferral Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures within 30 days of such eligibility, which election shall be effective on a prospective basis beginning with the payroll period that occurs as soon as administratively feasible following completion of the election. All other Eligible Employees may elect Salary Deferral Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures by the December 15th prior to the beginning of a Plan Year, which election shall be effective beginning the following January 1. All elections are effective for one Plan Year and are irrevocable for a Plan Year once made. However, if a Participant receives a hardship distribution under the Savings Plan, such Participant’s Salary Deferral Contribution election shall automatically be cancelled for the remainder of the calendar year in which the hardship distribution is received. Such Participant’s Salary Deferral Contributions shall be suspended
automatically for a period of six months following receipt of the hardship distribution and such Participant may not resume making Salary Deferral Contributions until the January 1 following the expiration of the six-month suspension period. 4.3 Bonus Contributions The Plan permits Bonus Contributions of between 1% and 100% of an Eligible Employee’s bonus paid from an Employer’s U.S. payroll. A newly designated Eligible Employee who is selected as eligible to make Employee Contributions to the Plan may elect to make Bonus Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures within 30 days of such eligibility, which election shall be effective on a prospective basis beginning with the payroll period that occurs as soon as administratively feasible following completion of the election. All other Eligible Employees may elect Bonus Contributions by making an election in accordance with the Committee’s procedures by December 15th, which election shall be effective for bonuses earned during any Employer’s fiscal year that ends after such date, provided that such election is made no later than six months prior to the end of the service period to which it relates. If an Eligible Employee is -8-

awarded a bonus or incentive pay or an award under the Amcor PET Packaging Management Incentive Plan, the Eligible Employee may elect to defer all or a portion of such award, provided that such election is made in the manner prescribed by the Committee. Such election will be irrevocable once made. Beginning on the January 1, 2005, a Participant’s election to defer all or a portion of a performance-based bonus attributable to services performed over a period of twelve months or more must be made no later than six months prior to the end of such 12-month period. 4.4 Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2005, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees in the amount necessary to provide such Participants with the employer matching contributions they will not receive under the Savings Plan due to: (i) the limitation of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (iii) the fact that a Participant’s Employee Contributions into this Plan are not included as compensation for purposes of determining contributions under the Savings Plan (“Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions”). However, to receive Employer Make- Up Matching Contributions in a Plan Year, an Eligible Employee must contribute the maximum amount allowable by law or the Employer under the Savings Plan. 4.5 Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2012, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees in the amount necessary to provide such Participants with the approximate benefits they will not receive under the Pension Plan due to: (i) the limitations of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (iii) the fact that a Participant’s Employee Contributions into this Plan are not included as compensation
for purposes of benefit accruals under the Pension Plan (“Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions”). The Employer may, in its sole discretion, choose not to make such a contribution in any Plan Year for some or all Participants. The Employer may, in its sole discretion, chose to make a contribution in any Plan Year for some or all Participants of less than the full amount necessary to make up the Pension Plan benefits due to items (i) through (iii) above. The following provisions and assumptions shall govern the determination of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions: (a) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions each Plan Year, the Employer shall assume that the Participant will terminate employment and begin receiving benefits from the Pension Plan at the later of age 60 or the Participant’s attainment of five years of service (as defined in the Pension Plan), which benefits shall be assumed to be reduced for early commencement unless the Participant has attained age 65 and completed 5 years of service. If a Participant terminates employment after age 55 and completion of 5 years of service but prior to age 60, the Participant will receive a lesser amount of Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions than if the Participant had remained employed until age 60. If a Participant who is eligible for Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions remains employed by -9-

an Employer until age 60 and completion of 5 years of service, the Participant will continue to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions past such date to account for the Participant’s service after such date. (b) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contribution each Plan Year, the Employer will base contributions on Compensation, the GAM 94 mortality table, and assumed Compensation increases of inflation plus 1.5%, provided that all actuarial assumptions may vary as the Committee determines advisable. The Employer will hypothetically assume that prior Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions on behalf of such Participant will increase at an earnings rate specified by the Committee, which as of January 1, 2005 equals the average of the 10-year Treasury US government securities plus 2%, notwithstanding the fact that the Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions will be invested in the investment funds selected by the Participant in accordance with subsection 6.2 of the Plan. (c) Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions for eligible Participants will be fully funded by the Employer at the later of: (i) the Participant’s attainment of age 60, or (ii) the Participant’s completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). However, if a Participant continues employment after age 60, the Committee shall determine the procedures for future funding of such Participant’s benefit. 4.6 Employer Special Contributions The Employer may, in its sole discretion, make an additional Employer Special Contribution in any Plan Year to Eligible Employees in any amount determined by the Committee. 4.7 Employer 10% Target Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2008, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees to provide such Participant with a supplemental retirement savings contribution (“Employer 10% Target
Contribution”). A Participant’s Employer 10% Target Contribution for the Plan Year shall equal 10% of the sum of the Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year, reduced by all of the following that are paid or accrued (or deemed paid or accrued as described below) for the same Plan Year: (a) Savings Plan Retirement Savings Contributions; (b) Savings Plan New Employer Matching Contributions; (c) Savings Plan Employer Discretionary Matching Contributions; and (d) the Employer portion of the Social Security tax on the Eligible Employee's Compensation for the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) -10-

program, which amount is currently 6.2% of the Eligible Employee's Compensation. For purposes of items (b) and (c), the Participant shall be deemed to have made the maximum employee contribution under the Savings Plan, and have received the maximum matching contribution available under the Savings Plan based upon such deemed employee contribution, regardless of the Participant’s actual contribution rate. -11-

SECTION 5 Accounting and Vesting 5.1 Vesting Except as provided in subsection 5.2, a Participant will fully vest in his Plan Accounts as follows: (a) A Participant will be fully vested at all times in the Participant’s own Employee Contributions held in the Participant’s Accounts. (b) A Participant will fully vest in his Employer Special Contributions in his Accounts upon completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). (c) A Participant will fully vest in his Employer 10% Target Contributions in his Accounts as follows: Years of Vested Service Percentage Less than 1 0% 1 20% 2 40% 3 60% 4 80% 5 or more 100% Years of service used to determine vesting in Employer 10% Target Contributions is defined under the Savings Plan. (d) A Participant will fully vest in his Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions and Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions upon the later of: (i) the Participant’s attainment of age 55, or (ii) the Participant’s completion of 5 years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). In addition, all of a Participant’s Employer Contributions will fully vest upon the Participant’s death or Disability while actively employed by an Employer. Even if fully vested, a Participant will not receive the entire amount of Employer Make-up Pension Contributions deemed necessary to make up the Participant’s Pension Plan benefit if the Participant terminates employment prior to age 60. A Participant who terminates employment other than by reason of death or Disability prior to vesting in his Employer Contributions shall forfeit 100% of his Employer Contributions. -12-

5.2 Termination for Cause or Violation of Non-Compete Restrictions Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, any Participant terminated for cause shall forfeit 100% of the Participant’s Accounts. A Participant is terminated for cause when, in the sole discretion of the Committee, such Participant is terminated as a result of: (i) fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement of Employer funds or property, or (ii) the Participant’s intentional and material damage to the property of an Employer or an Affiliate. In addition, any Participant who works for, counsels, advises, or otherwise assists a person, entity or business that is a “competing business,” before or after the Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations, notices and other guidance thereunder, including death) from an Employer, shall forfeit 100% of the Participant’s Employer Contributions. If the Participant has already received a partial distribution of the Participant’s Employer Contributions when the Participant performs services for a competing business, or when the Employer learns that the Participant performed services for a competing business, the Participant shall forfeit 100% of any unpaid portion of the Participant’s Employer Contributions. For purposes of the Plan, a “competing business” is any person’s, firm, corporation, or entity engaged in, or conducting business which is the same as, or competing with, the business being conducted by the Company as determined in the Committee’s discretion. 5.3 Forfeitures All Forfeitures shall be used to reduce Employer Contributions for the current Plan Year or succeeding Plan Years, or shall be used to pay reasonable administrative expenses of the Plan. 5.4 Allocation of Employee Contributions and Employer Contributions The total amount, if any, of Salary Deferral Contributions, Bonus Contributions, Employer Make-Up Matching Contributions, Employer Make-Up
Pension Contributions, Employer Special Contributions, and Employer 10% Target Contributions for any Plan Year made on behalf of a Participant will be allocated to the Participant’s Accounts periodically as determined by the Committee. 5.5 Accounts The Employer shall establish and maintain one or more Accounts described in subsection 5.4 in the name of each Participant. Grandfathered Accounts will remain separate from 409A Accounts. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Employer Contributions shall be held in 409A Accounts. Beginning in 2007, the Plan shall use class- year accounting, and contributions made by or on behalf of each Participant shall be held in separate subaccounts within the Participant’s 409A Accounts. Each Participant’s Accounts will be credited with earnings, losses, distributions and contributions as of each accounting date established by the Investment Committee. All amounts which are credited to a Participant’s Accounts shall be credited solely for purposes of accounting and computation and shall remain Employer assets subject to the claims of the Employer’s general creditors. A -13-

Participant shall have an interest or right in the Participant’s Accounts only as provided under the Plan. -14-

SECTION 6 Funding and Investments 6.1 Trust Fund The Trust shall hold all assets of the Plan. The Trust shall consist of such investments or funds as the Investment Committee shall determine from time to time. Pending investment, reinvestment or distribution of assets, the Trustee may temporarily retain assets of any Investment Fund in cash, commercial paper, short-term obligations, or common or collective short-term investment funds. The Investment Committee may direct the Trustee to establish or terminate an Investment Fund as it shall from time to time consider appropriate. 6.2 Investment Fund Elections A Participant may elect to invest all or a portion of the Participant’s Account in one or more Investment Funds selected by the Investment Committee. A Participant also may elect to change or transfer the Participant’s Account balances to one or more other Investment Funds. All investment elections shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Investment Committee and shall be effective only at the Investment Committee’s discretion and as prescribed by the Investment Committee. A Participant will have the opportunity to make two separate investment elections: (i) one with respect to the Participant’s Employer Contributions, and (ii) one with respect to the Participant’s Employee Contributions. 6.3 Expenses The Investment Committee shall determine whether expenses incurred in administering the Plan shall be paid from the Trust or by the Employers in such proportions and allocations as the Investment Committee determines. -15-

SECTION 7 Timing and Form of Payment 7.1 Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts A Participant may elect the timing and form of payment for the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts by completing a benefit election form prescribed by the Committee. A Participant may elect to receive the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts as of: (i) the Participant’s termination of employment, or (ii) a specified date elected by the Participant. If a Participant terminates service from all Employers and their Affiliates prior to retirement, the Participant will receive a distribution of the Participant’s Grandfathered Account in a lump sum. If a Participant requests a distribution prior to service termination, or if a Participant terminates service due to retirement or Disability, a Participant’s Grandfathered Account may be distributed in: (i) a lump sum, or (ii) substantially equal annual installments payable at the Participant’s election over a one-year to ten-year period specified by the Participant. The benefit election form will be valid as to all amounts in a Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts unless the Participant alters the Participant’s benefit election form, provided that a Participant must submit a revised benefit election form at least 12 months prior to a distribution. If a Participant fails to make a selection among the available forms of payment, the Participant shall receive payment in a lump sum. The Committee shall determine if a Participant’s termination is due to retirement or Disability. 7.2 Employee Contributions in 409A Accounts Prior to the allocation of Employee Contributions to the Participant’s 409A Accounts, a Participant must elect the timing and form of payment for such Employee Contributions from the Participant’s 409A Accounts by completing a distribution election form in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee (the “Initial Election”). Beginning with contributions for 2007, a Participant shall make a separate distribution election for
each year of Employee Contributions. A Participant may elect that the Employee Contributions in the Participant’s 409A Accounts be distributed upon the earlier of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following the Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations, notices and other guidance thereunder, including death) from the Employer, or (ii) a specific date elected by the Participant. The Employee Contributions in a Participant’s 409A Accounts may be distributed in: (i) a lump sum, or (ii) substantially equal annual installments payable at the Participant’s election over a two-year to ten-year period specified by the Participant. For purposes of the Plan, a series of installment payments shall be -16-

treated as a single payment in accordance with the regulations under Section 409A of the Code. The Initial Election will apply to distributions of all Employee Contributions made prior to January 1, 2007, and applicable earnings or losses, in a Participant’s 409A Accounts unless the Participant executes another benefit election form (a “Second Election”), subject to the following provisions: (i) a Second Election will not take effect until twelve months after the date on which the Second Election is made, (ii) the payment date selected on a Second Election must be a date not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made under the Initial Election, (iii) a Second Election must be made at least twelve months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the Initial Election, (iv) a Second Election may not accelerate payment of the Employee Contributions in a Participant’s 409A Accounts, and (v) a Second Election may only designate distribution payment forms described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be entitled to make a Second Election with respect to any Employee Contributions made on or after January 1, 2007. If a Participant fails to make a selection among the available forms of payment, the Participant shall receive payment of Employee Contributions in the Participant’s 409A Accounts in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant’s separation from service. Beginning January 1, 2007, Participants may modify their elections for 2005 and 2006 Employee Contributions in their 409A Accounts with respect to the form and timing of payment of such contributions, but such modifications are subject to the restrictions applicable to Second Elections that are described above. 7.3 Employer Contributions in 409A Accounts Upon being selected by the Committee to receive Employer Contributions, a Participant will elect the form of payment for the
Participant’s Employer Contributions held in the Participant’s 409A Accounts by completing a distribution election form in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee. Beginning with 2007 contributions, a Participant shall make a separate distribution election form for each year of Employer Contributions. A Participant’s Employer Contributions held in the Participant’s 409A Accounts shall be distributed upon the first day of the thirteenth month following Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations, notices and other guidance thereunder, including death) from the Employer. The Employer Contributions in a Participant’s 409A Accounts may be distributed in: -17-

(i) a lump sum, or (ii) substantially equal annual installments payable at the Participant’s election over a two-year to ten-year period specified by the Participant. For purposes of the Plan, a series of installment payments shall be treated as a single payment in accordance with the regulations under Section 409A of the Code. Once such election is made, neither the Participant nor the Employer may change the timing or form of distribution of a Participant’s Employer Contributions held in the Participant’s 409A Accounts. If a Participant fails to make a payment election, the Participant shall receive payment of Employer Contributions in a lump sum. 7.4 Hardship Distributions A Participant may receive a distribution from the Participant’s vested Accounts for hardship reasons, provided the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency (as defined below). The Committee may request such evidence of a hardship as it deems necessary. All hardship distributions will be made in a lump sum within 90 days following the Participant’s hardship request; provided, however, that hardship distributions shall be paid from 409A Accounts prior to payment from Grandfathered Accounts. The following rules shall apply to a hardship distribution: (a) An “Unforeseeable Financial Emergency” is a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from: (i) a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or of a dependent of the Participant, (ii) loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty, or (iii) such other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. (b) The amount of hardship distribution on behalf of an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency will be reduced to the extent that it is or may be relieved: (i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or (ii) by liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would
not itself cause severe financial hardship. (c) The determination of whether a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Financial Emergency, and the amount of payment to which the Participant is entitled, shall be determined by the Committee based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. If a Participant receives a hardship distribution from the Plan, then the Participant’s Employee Contributions shall be suspended for the remainder of the calendar year in which such distribution occurred. -18-

7.5 Payments After Death If a Participant dies before receiving the entire balance of the Participant’s Accounts, the remaining balance in the Participant’s Accounts shall become 100% vested and shall be paid to the Participant’s Beneficiaries designated in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee. Payment of the remaining balance of the Participant’s Accounts shall be made in a single lump sum within 90 days following the date on which the Committee is notified of the Participant’s death. 7.6 Payments Upon Disability Notwithstanding a Participant’s elections and any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all Accounts that have not yet commenced distribution shall automatically be distributed to a Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the Participant’s Disability as defined under subsection 2.10. Upon Disability, a Participant will receive distribution of the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts either in: (i) a lump sum; or (ii) substantially equal annual installments payable at the Participant’s election over a two-year to ten-year period specified by the Participant. If a Participant wishes to make changes to any Disability distribution election form with respect to the Participant’s Grandfathered Accounts, such changes must comply with the rules contained in subsection 7.1. Upon a Participant’s Disability, the Participant’s 409A Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant in accordance with the forms of payment elected on the Participant’s distribution election form applicable to each year of contributions. If a Participant wishes to make changes to any Disability distribution election form with respect to the Employee Contributions in the Participant’s 409A Accounts, such changes must comply with the rules contained in subsection 7.2. 7.7 Special Distribution Rules for 409A Accounts If the Company or Affiliate’s deduction for payment of all or any portion of to a Participant’s 409A Accounts would be limited or
eliminated by the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, then the Plan will defer payment of such Participant’s 409A Accounts either (i) to a date in the first year in which the Company or the Committee reasonably anticipates that such payment will not result in a deduction limitation under Section 162(m) or (ii) to the year in which the Participant’s separation from employment occurs. If payment of all or any portion of the Participant’s 409A Accounts would violate securities or other applicable laws, or would violate loan covenants or other contractual terms to which the Company or an Affiliate is a party and such violation would result in material harm to the Company or an Affiliate, then payment of the Participant’s 409A Accounts will be made in the first calendar year: (i) in which the Company or Committee reasonably anticipates that the payment would not violate loan or other similar contractual terms and would not result in material harm to the Company or an Affiliate, and (ii) in which the payment would not result in a violation of securities or other applicable laws. Plan payments intended to pay employment taxes, or made as a result of income inclusion of an amount of a Participant’s -19-

benefit as a result of a failure to satisfy Section 409A of the Code, shall be permitted at the Company or Committee’s discretion at any time to the extent provided in Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1, Q&A-15, and any applicable subsequent guidance. “Employment taxes” shall include the Federal Income Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101 and 3121(v)(2) of the Code on compensation deferred under the Plan (the “FICA Amount”), the income tax imposed under Section 3401 of the Code on the FICA Amount, and any amounts utilized to pay the additional income tax under Section 3401 of the Code attributable to the pyramiding Section 3401 wages and taxes. If any applicable payment period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary (as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the year of the payment. 7.8 Designation of Beneficiary A Participant may, by completing a Beneficiary designation form in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee, designate one or more primary and contingent Beneficiaries (which may include a trust or an estate) to receive the Participant’s Account balance following the Participant’s death and may designate the proportions in which such Beneficiaries receive payments. A Participant’s Beneficiary designation shall apply to all of his Accounts under the Plan. A Participant may change such designations from time to time, and the last designation filed prior to the Participant’s death shall control. If no Beneficiary designation form was filed by the Participant prior to the Participant’s death, the Participant’s remaining Account balance will be paid to the Participant’s estate. 7.9 Facility of Payment Any amounts payable under the Plan to a Participant or Beneficiary who is under a legal disability or who, in the judgment of the Committee, is unable to manage such person’s
affairs, may be paid to the legal representative of such person or may be applied for the benefit of such person in any manner the Committee shall select. 7.10 Unclaimed Benefits If a Participant or Beneficiary’s whereabouts are unknown to the Employer, and if the Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary fails to claim the Participant’s benefits within two years following termination of the Participant’s employment, the Committee may elect to make payment of the Participant or Beneficiary’s vested benefits as if they had died. If the Employer is unable to locate the Participant or any Beneficiary within three years following the Participant’s employment termination, the Participant and all of the Participant’s designated Beneficiaries shall forfeit all benefits irrevocably. -20-

SECTION 8 Nature of Interest of Participant Participation in this Plan will not create, in favor of any Participant, any right or lien in or against any of the assets of any Employer, and a Participant’s Account balances shall remain an unrestricted asset of the Participant’s Employer. A Participant’s rights to benefits payable under the Plan are not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance. All payments hereunder shall be paid in cash from the general funds of the applicable Employer and no special or separate fund shall be established and no other segregation of assets shall be made to assure the payment of benefits hereunder. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship, between any Employer and a Participant or any other person, and each Employer’s promise to pay benefits hereunder shall at all times remain unfunded as to the Participant. -21-

SECTION 9 Administration 9.1 Committee This Plan will be administered by the Committee. 9.2 Powers of the Administrative and Investment Committees The Committee’s powers will include, but will not be limited to, the power: (a) to interpret, in its sole discretion, the terms and provisions of the Plan and to determine any and all questions arising under the Plan, including without limitation, the right to remedy possible ambiguities, inconsistencies, or omissions by a general rule or particular decision, (b) to adopt such rules of procedure and regulations as in its opinion may be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the Plan and as are consistent with the Plan and Trust agreement, (c) to enforce the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust and in accordance with the rules and regulations the Committee has adopted, (d) to direct the Trustees as respects payments or distributions from the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, (e) to furnish the Employers with such information as may be required by them for tax or other purposes in connection with the Plan, and (f) to employ agents, attorneys, accountants, actuaries or other persons (who also may be employed by the Employers) and to allocate or delegate to them such powers, rights and duties as the Committee may consider necessary or advisable to properly carry out administration of the Plan, provided that such allocation or delegation and the acceptance thereof by such agents, attorneys, accountants, actuaries or other persons, shall be in writing. The Investment Committee’s powers will include, but will not be limited to, the power to exercise full authority and control with respect to the appointment of trustees and investment managers and the investment of Plan assets generally. 9.3 Withholding The Employers shall have the right to deduct from any payment to be made under the Plan any federal, state, or local taxes required by law to be withheld. -22-

9.4 Retirement Claims Procedures To the extent that a Participant’s claim relates to a determination with respect to his Accounts, other than a Disability determination, the Committee will provide the Participant with notice of the status of his claim for retirement benefits within a reasonable period of time after a complete claim has been filed, but no later than 90 days after receipt of the Participant’s benefit claim. The Committee may request an additional 90 day extension if special circumstances warrant by notifying the Participant of the extension before the expiration of the initial 90 day period. If the Participant has not submitted sufficient information to the Committee to process the Participant’s retirement benefit claim, the Participant will be notified of the incomplete claim and given 90 days to submit additional information. This will extend the time in which the Committee has to respond to the Participant’s claim from the date the notice of insufficient information is sent to the Participant until the date the Participant responds to the request. If the Participant does not submit the missing information to the Committee within 90 days of the date of the request, the claim will be denied. If the Participant’s benefit claim is denied, the Participant will receive a notice which will include: (i) the specific reasons for the denial, (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions upon which the decision is based, (iii) a description of any additional information the Participant might be required to provide with an explanation of why it is needed, (iv) an explanation of the Plan’s claims review and appeal procedures, and (v) a statement regarding the Participant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial on appeal. The Participant may appeal a denial of a retirement benefit claim by filing a written request with the Committee within 60 days of receipt of the initial denial notice. In connection with the appeal, the Participant may request that
the Committee provide, free of charge, copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim. The Participant may also submit written comments, records, documents, and other information relevant to the appeal, whether or not such documents were submitted in connection with the initial claim. The Committee will conduct a full and fair review of the documents and evidence submitted and will ordinarily render a decision on the Participant’s benefit claim no later than 60 days after receipt of the request for review on appeal. If there are special circumstances, the decision will be made as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review on appeal. If such an extension of time is needed, the Participant will be notified in writing prior to the end of the first 60 day period. The Committee’s final written decision will set forth: (i) the specific reasons for the decision, (ii) references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based, (iii) a statement that the Participant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the benefit claim due to Disability, and (iv) a statement regarding the Participant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial on appeal. 9.5 Disability Claims Procedures To the extent that a Participant’s claim relates to a Disability determination with respect to his Accounts, the Committee will provide the Participant with notice of the status of his claim for Disability benefits within a reasonable period of time after a complete claim has -23-

been filed, but no later than 45 days after receipt of the Participant’s benefit claim. The Committee may request an additional 30 day extension if special circumstances warrant by notifying the Participant of the extension before the expiration of the initial 45 day period. If a decision still cannot be made within this 30 day extension period due to circumstances outside the Committee’s control, the time period may be extended for an additional 30 days, in which case the Participant will be notified before the expiration of the original 30 day extension. If the Participant has not submitted sufficient information to the Committee to process the Participant’s Disability claim, the Participant will be notified of the incomplete claim and given 45 days to submit additional information. This will extend the time in which the Committee has to respond to the Participant’s claim from the date the notice of insufficient information is sent to the Participant until the date the Participant responds to the request. If the Participant does not submit the missing information to the Committee within 45 days of the date of the request, the claim will be denied. If the Participant’s benefit claim is denied, the Participant will receive a notice which will include: (i) the specific reasons for the denial, (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions upon which the decision is based, (iii) a description of any additional information the Participant might be required to provide with an explanation of why it is needed, (iv) an explanation of the Plan’s claims review and appeal procedures, and (v) a statement regarding the Participant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial on appeal. The Participant may appeal a denial of a Disability benefit claim by filing a written request with the Committee within 180 days of receipt of the initial denial notice. In connection with the appeal, the Participant may request that the Committee provide, free of charge, copies of all
documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim. The Participant may also submit written comments, records, documents, and other information relevant to the appeal, whether or not such documents were submitted in connection with the initial claim. The Committee may consult with medical or vocational experts in connection with Disability claim. The Committee will conduct a full and fair review of the documents and evidence submitted and will ordinarily render a decision on the Participant’s benefit claim no later than 45 days after receipt of the request for review on appeal. If there are special circumstances, the decision will be made as soon as possible, but not later than 90 days after receipt of the request for review on appeal. If such an extension of time is needed, the Participant will be notified in writing prior to the end of the first 45 day period. The Committee’s final written decision will set forth: (i) the specific reasons for the decision, (ii) references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based, (iii) a statement that the Participant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the benefit claim due to Disability, and (iv) a statement regarding the Participant’s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial on appeal. 9.6 Liability No member of the Administrative or Investment Committees shall be liable for any act of commission or omission in connection with the administration of the Plan, except in circumstances involving bad faith, gross misconduct, or fraud. Except in such instances, the Employers shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Administrative or Investment Committees members from any and all damages, losses, or costs (including reasonable -24-

attorneys’ fees) that occur by reason of, arise out of, or are incidental to the implementation or administration of the Plan. 9.7 Finality of Committee Determinations Determinations by the Committee or Investment Committees and any interpretation, rule, or administrative decision adopted by the Committee or Investment Committees shall be final and binding for all Plan purposes and upon all interested persons, their heirs, and their personal representatives. No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover benefits under the Plan until the claim and review processes in this Section have been exercised and until the Plan benefits requested in such review have been denied in whole or in part. If any judicial proceeding is undertaken to appeal the denial of a claim or bring any other action under ERISA, other than a breach of fiduciary duty claim, the evidence presented shall be strictly limited to the evidence timely presented to the Committee. If the Committee denies a Participant’s appeal in whole or in part, and the Participant subsequently wishes to file a claim against the Plan, any such legal action must be brought within 120 days of the Committee’s final decision. Benefits will be paid only if the Committee decides a Participant or Beneficiary is entitled to them. 9.8 Governing Law To the extent this Plan is not preempted by ERISA, the Plan shall be governed by laws of the State of Delaware. -25-

SECTION 10 No Employment Rights No provisions of the Plan or any action taken by the Company, the Board of Directors, the Committee, or the Investment Committee shall give any person any right to be retained in the employ of any Employer, and the right and power of an Employer to dismiss or discharge any Participant is specifically reserved. -26-

SECTION 11 Change in Control 11.1 Amounts Held in Grandfathered Accounts In the event that the stock or substantially all the assets of an Employer, its subsidiary, or one of its divisions is sold, or if a majority of the beneficial ownership of an Employer, subsidiary, or one of its divisions alters (“Change in Control”), the Grandfathered Accounts of Participants affected by such sale shall become immediately due and payable unless a successor of the Employer assumes the liabilities and responsibilities relating to the affected Participants. 11.2 Amounts Held in 409A Accounts In the event that there is a change in ownership of the Employer, a change in effective control of the Employer, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Employer, as defined in Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder (collectively, a “Change in Control Event”), the 409A Accounts of Participants affected by such Change in Control Event shall become 100% vested and shall be immediately due and payable in a lump sum. -27-

SECTION 12 Amendment, Suspension, and Termination The Board of Directors, by resolution duly adopted, shall have the right to amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any time, provided that the Board may delegate all or a portion of such rights to the Committees or to any specified person or persons. No amendment, modification, or termination shall, without the consent of a Participant, reduce the Participant’s vested Account balance. In the event the Plan is terminated, the Committee shall continue to administer the Plan in accordance with the relevant provisions thereof. * * * IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this amended and restated Plan to be executed by a duly authorized member of the Committee as of this ____ day of _________________, 2013.
