Business Unit Summary

Intel previously announced the organizational change to integrate its Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics
Group into its Client Computing Group and Data Center and AI Group. This change is intended to drive a more
effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a
result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other
business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the
company internally receives information and manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in
fiscal year 2023.

▪

Intel continues to be on track to meet its goal of achieving five nodes in four years, with two of the five
nodes nearly complete. Intel 7 is in high-volume manufacturing and CCG's Meteor Lake product on Intel 4
is ramping production wafer starts for an expected launch in the second half of 2023. Intel 3, Intel 20A, and
Intel 18A remain on track.

▪  DCAI shipped its 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (code-named Sapphire Rapids), a critical part

of Intel’s heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to accelerate real-world workloads, including AI, as
it looks to truly democratize AI through an open and secure ecosystem approach.

▪  DCAI also announced it expects to deliver Intel’s 5th Gen Xeon Scalable processor, Emerald Rapids, later

this year. In addition, the business narrowed the delivery window for Sierra Forest, which is expected to ship
to customers in the first half of 2024, with Granite Rapids expected to follow shortly thereafter. Clearwater
Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, is expected to ship in 2025, and will be manufactured on Intel 18A,
the node designed to achieve process leadership and representing the culmination of the company’s five-
nodes-in-four-years strategy. Additionally, the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) had an all-time record
revenue quarter in Q1.
IFS and Arm announced a multigeneration agreement to enable chip designers to build low-power compute
system-on-chips (SoCs) on the Intel 18A process. Intel delivered and supplied the first multi-chip package
(MCP) prototypes created under the U.S. Department of Defense’s State-of-the-Art Heterogeneous
Integrated Packaging (SHIP) program to BAE Systems six quarters ahead of schedule, showcasing the
company’s commitment to customers while further supporting the DOD’s mission to return the U.S. to a
leading role in the microelectronics ecosystem.

▪

▪  CCG introduced the 13th Gen Intel® Core™ mobile processor family, led by the launch of the first 24-core
processor for a laptop and world’s fastest mobile processor. Intel also introduced the new Intel vPro®
platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors. In 2023, the expansive commercial
portfolio is expected to deliver more than 170 notebooks, desktops, and entry workstations from partners
including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Panasonic, and Samsung Electronics.

▪  NEX launched its 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel® vRAN Boost, delivering two times the
capacity gains generation-over-generation within the same power envelope1 and up to an additional 20%
power savings2 with integrated acceleration, with extensive industry support from Ericsson, Verizon,
Telefonica, and Vodafone, among many others.

▪  Mobileye continues to grow significantly faster than underlying automotive end-markets, achieving record

first quarter revenue.

¹(2x capacity): Estimated as of 12/06/2022 based on 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor as compared to 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable
at similar core count, socket power, and frequency, using a FlexRAN™ test scenario. Results may vary.  Performance varies by use,
configuration and other factors.
(double PPW): Estimated as of 12/06/2022 based on 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor as compared to 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable

Business Outlook

Intel's guidance for the second quarter of 2023 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates. Reconciliations
between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.*

Q2 2023

Revenue
Gross margin
Tax rate
Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel - diluted

GAAP*
Approximately
$11.5-12.5 billion

Non-GAAP*
Approximately
$11.5-12.5 billion^

Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors
described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below.

*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years.
When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.1
billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.3 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses,
and a $1.4 billion decrease in ending inventory values. Intel’s Q2 2023 outlook includes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating
margin or $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to operating expenses. The change in
depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023 or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3
2022 earnings.

Earnings Webcast

Intel will hold a public webcast at 2 p.m. PST today to discuss the results for its first quarter 2023. The live public
webcast can be accessed on Intel's Investor Relations website at www.intc.com. The corresponding earnings
presentation and webcast replay will also be available on the site.

^ No adjustment on a non-GAAP basis.

We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components
and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone system-on-chip or a multichip package,
which are based on Intel architecture.

Revenue for our reportable and non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product

lines:

▪  CCG includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2 in 1, thin-

and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics.

▪  DCAI includes a broad portfolio of central processing units (CPUs), domain-specific accelerators and field

programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), designed to empower data center and hyperscale solutions for diverse
computing needs.

▪  NEX includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for
market segments such as cloud networking, telecommunications networks, on-premises edge, software and
platforms.

▪  Mobileye includes the development and deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and

autonomous driving technologies and solutions.

▪

IFS provides differentiated full stack solutions including wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard and
software.

We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance and administration groups. Expenses for these
groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.

We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses and charges such as:

▪

▪

▪

▪

▪

results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that
support our initiatives;

historical results of operations from divested businesses;

amounts included within restructuring and other charges;

employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating
segments; and

acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and
goodwill.

Intel Corporation
Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the
non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful
supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results
between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus
plans.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the
related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected
tax rate across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year
non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP
tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation
in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a
variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic
earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in
managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this
approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating
performance. Prior-period non-GAAP results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this updated approach.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and
reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

combinations. Charges related to the amortization
of these intangibles are recorded within both cost
of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial
statements. Amortization charges are recorded
over the estimated useful life of the related
acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally
recorded over multiple years.
Share-based compensation consists of charges
related to our employee equity incentive plans.

Usefulness to management and investors
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-
related intangible assets for purposes of calculating
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges
are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted
by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our
current operating performance and comparison to our
past operating performance and provide investors with
additional means to evaluate cost and expense
trends.

We exclude charges related to share-based
compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-
GAAP measures because we believe these
adjustments provide better comparability to peer
company results and because these charges are not
viewed by management as part of our core operating
performance. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of
management, of our core business model, how
management currently evaluates core operational
performance, and additional means to evaluate
expense trends, including in comparison to other peer
companies.

Definition
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related
to employee severance and benefit arrangements.
Other charges may include periodic goodwill and
asset impairments, certain pension charges, and
costs associated with restructuring activity, and in
Q1 2022 includes a benefit related to the annulled
EC fine.

Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when
deferred consideration is received at the time of
closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the
NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement
entered into in connection with the first closing of
the sale of our NAND memory business on
December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing
consideration was deferred and will be recognized
between first and second closing.
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists
of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on
marketable equity securities, observable price
adjustments on non-marketable equity securities,
related impairment charges, and the sale of equity
investments and other.
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by
management when assessing our sources of
liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings.
Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow
adjusted for 1) additions to property, plant and
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants and
partner contributions, 2) payments on finance
leases, and 3) proceeds from the McAfee equity
sale.

Usefulness to management and investors
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods,
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP
measures because these costs do not reflect our core
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our core operating performance
and comparisons to past operating results and provide
investors with additional means to evaluate expense
trends.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP
measures because they do not reflect our current
operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our current operating performance
and comparisons to past operating results.

We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures
because it provides better comparability between
periods. The exclusion reflects how management
evaluates the core operations of the business.

This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in
understanding our capital requirements and sources
of liquidity by providing an additional means to
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since
the 2017 divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and
sales contributed to prior operating and free cash flow,
and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would
have typically been excluded from adjusted free cash
flow as an equity sale, we believe including the sale
proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better,
more consistent comparison to past presentations of
liquidity.
