“Risk
Factors.”

Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices

are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
under the symbol “AMZN.”

As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

General

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for
invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers,
sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising.

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way
the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in
our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.

Consumers

We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of
millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile
apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo
devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shipping
offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and
reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100
million items, access to unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits.

We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-
sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which
are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”

Sellers

We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record

in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.

Developers and Enterprises

We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which

offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings.

3

Table of Contents

Content Creators

We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty

option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow
authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.

Competition

Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is

evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and
potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products
we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution
channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or
acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website
development, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for
third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based
infrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. We
believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional
competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and
willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand
recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue
restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with
restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the
development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances
that strengthen their competitive positions.

Intellectual Property

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual

property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with
our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and
international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of
our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.

Seasonality

Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We

recognized 32% , 34% , and 31% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Fourth quarter 2017 results include revenue
attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017.

Employees

We employed approximately 647,500 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2018 . However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal
factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils,
statutory employee representation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the
United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for
software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Please carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows

could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.

We Face Intense Competition

Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and

omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logistics
services, and across geographies, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more
customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure
better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.

Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our

competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In
addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our
competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.

Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources

We are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to
support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel,
operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth
effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive

Risks

We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new and
difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In
addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to
recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate

We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our

expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.

Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the
continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions
worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased
revenue or growth.

Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:

•

•

•

•

•

our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;

our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;

our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;

the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;

changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;

timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;

the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;

the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse
impact on our operating results;

variations in the mix of products and services we sell;

variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;

the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;

factors affecting our reputation or brand image;

the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;

increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies;

the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items;

the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and
unconstrained access to our online services;

our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer
intrusions, outages, and similar events; and

terrorist attacks and armed hostilities.

Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks

Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments,

we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and
maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

local economic and political conditions;

government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade
protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;

restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including
uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding
the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;

business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;

limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;

limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;

shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;

laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;

lower levels of use of the Internet;

lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;

lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;

difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;

7

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;

compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials
and other third parties;

laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and

geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.

As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving

business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as
well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international
growth.

The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license

requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet
content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements,
www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology
services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian
companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services
to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the
www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India are
actively considering changes in their foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the
interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our
Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce
contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or
future PRC, Indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject
to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.

If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be Harmed

If we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in

excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As we
continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become
increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.

In addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and

our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform
inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be
unable to optimize our fulfillment network.

We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate

acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer
experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement
weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.

Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and

operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand
would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.

8

Table of Contents

The Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations

We expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts

such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take
significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping
cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many
customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable
or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we
may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and
customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network
optimization and inventory.

We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.
As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other
than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable
as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities balances.

Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other

Business Relationships

We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business
relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to
offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource
commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these
commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware,
content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial
agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we
receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and
strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in
implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.

As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into
amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating
results.

Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:

disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;

impairment of other relationships;

variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and

difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.

Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments

We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These

transactions (such as our acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as:

•

•

•

•

disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;

problems retaining key personnel;

additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;

the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;

•

the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of
any integration of operations;

the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;

the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;

the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and
other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;

for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the
investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;

the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;

the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;

potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and

for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and
regulatory risks associated with specific countries.

As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or
amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if
at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could
determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.

We Have Foreign Exchange Risk

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed
to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on
the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also
hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens
compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.

The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our

Business

We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key
person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been
intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the
inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.

We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches

Because we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security

breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ or customers’ technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such
information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and
otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and
authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past
security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.
Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including

10

Table of Contents

systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security.

We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy

We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently

fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to
continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it
could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.

Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,

earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could
cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could
make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be
sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be
expensive to remedy.

We Face Significant Inventory Risk

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to

significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and
pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage,
and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for
products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or
manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast
demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a
broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or
during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.

We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to

our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,
customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and
services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,
regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring
domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.

We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also

may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of
significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent
third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire
equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.

Other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal
proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations.
We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us
or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property
we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.

11

Table of Contents

Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights
management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include
their content in our service.

We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile

We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks

described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

changes in interest rates;

conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;

quarterly variations in operating results;

fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;

changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;

changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;

changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and

transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.

Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or

grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.

Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and
omnichannel retail, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover
taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste,
energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and
protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services
or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services,
product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel,
data protection, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, and artificial intelligence technologies and services.
Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions
interpreting or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing
business.

We Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize
additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting
rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are
considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the
remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote
sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries
have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by
additional taxes of this nature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to
provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may
not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by the effective date.

12

Table of Contents

Our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new
businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to
realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our
deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinary
course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law,
significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of
information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or
issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to
amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.

We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us.

Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for
which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these
proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and
any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.

Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks

We have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,

manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee
availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop
selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier
bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in
a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of
standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our
growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations

Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements

relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any
violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments,
forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by
the government at any time, without cause.

We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture

Some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or

environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our services and stores that may
increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability
insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on
economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.

We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit

from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our
customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes
that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods,

13

Table of Contents

including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on
third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic
checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We
also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association
operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to
make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, or
otherwise unable to detect or prevent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our
ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our
business and operating results could be adversely affected.

In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third

parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements for
licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or
processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money
laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or
regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.

We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers

The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way this

business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never
receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. We also may be unable to prevent sellers in
our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the
proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these
situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent
any of this occurs, it could harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position,
made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to
identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could
differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer
spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities
and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the
extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree
to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as
other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of
Part I, “Risk Factors.”

Overview

Our
primary
source
of
revenue
is
the
sale
of
a
wide
range
of
products
and
services
to
customers
. The products offered through our stores include

merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally,
we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as
service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other
services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising.

Our
financial
focus
is
on
long-term,
sustainable
growth
in
free
cash
flows
1
.
Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and
efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating
income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in
longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering
prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding
product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.

We
seek
to
reduce
our
variable
costs
per
unit
and
work
to
leverage
our
fixed
costs.
Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing

and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a
portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our
online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generally
change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other
factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts
from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.

Because
of
our
model
we
are
able
to
turn
our
inventory
quickly
and
have
a
cash-generating
operating
cycle

.
On average, our high inventory velocity
means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected
by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and
selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.
We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales
by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment
terms with suppliers.

We
expect

Our

often
support
a
variety
of
product

due
to
geographic

and
the

We
seek
to

efficiently
in
several
areas
of

including
AWS,
and
expansion
of
new

to

and

our
process
efficiencies.
We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless
connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these
continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing
in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.

We

the
flexibility
to
issue
shares
for
strategic
purposes,
such
as
financings,
acquisitions,

and
aligning
employee
compensation
with
shareholders’
interests.
We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we
believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and
unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507
million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Our
financial
reporting
currency
is
the
U.S.
Dollar
and
changes
in
foreign
exchange
rates
significantly
affect
our
reported
results
and
consolidated
trends
.
For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will
be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our
consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the
U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating
results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.

In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign

currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated
trends and comparisons.

Critical Accounting Judgments

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of
the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of
the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments
addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding
our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting
Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results
may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and

net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as
through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions
about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the
future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 , we would have recorded an additional cost
of sales of approximately $190 million.

In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted

customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.

Income
Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles,

and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and
significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary
course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our
business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,
including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have
higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting
rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the
U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in
response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.

The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not

previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations,
and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting
bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued,
we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the
adjustments are made.

We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.

Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for
which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these
proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and
any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial

Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions):

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair

value, were $ 26.0 billion , $31.0 billion , and $41.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $9.1 billion ,
$11.1 billion , and $13.8 billion , as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.2 billion , $18.4 billion , and $30.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our operating cash flows result
primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for
products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term
obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy
from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is
primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used
in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including
seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates.

Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from
property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities
of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(9.5) billion , $(27.1) billion , and $(12.4) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the
variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of
marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 6.7 billion , $ 10.1 billion , and $11.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , which primarily reflect additional
capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of
which is to support AWS), during all three years. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other
investment activity of $116 million , $14.0 billion , and $2.2 billion .

Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.7) billion , $9.9 billion , and $(7.7) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Cash outflows from financing
activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other, which were $4.3
billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.5 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $5.7 billion , $9.6 billion , and $10.6
billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology
infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term
debt and other. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $618 million , $16.2 billion , and $768 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . During 2017, cash inflows
from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through
2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market,
to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes.

Table of Contents

In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured
commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were
no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 .

We had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under
our $620 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information.

In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to
U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our
foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur
significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign
subsidiaries was $12.0 billion.

We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our

U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified
property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . As of
December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits
potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize
our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a
financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an
initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject
to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals.

Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain

jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our
customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash
equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.3 billion and $426 million . See Item 8 of Part II,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments,
as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments,
were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the
contractual provisions.

We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing
arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and
cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt
securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or
otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.

The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the

acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity
requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or
financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Results of Operations

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market

from the date of acquisition in August 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item
8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”

Net
Sales

Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content
where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees,
AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

Sales increased 31% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(550)

million , $210 million , and $1.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign
Exchange Rates” below.

North America sales increased 33% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased

unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued
efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.

International sales increased 23% and 21% in 2017 , and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects
increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers,
including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted
International net sales by $(489) million , $138 million , and $1.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

AWS sales increased 43 % and 47 % in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased

customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.

Operating income was $4.2 billion , $4.1 billion , and $12.4 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful

measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.

The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased

unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our
fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $27 million , $(4) million , and $17 million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit

sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment
network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $89 million , $(85) million , and $258 million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased customer

usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses,
which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(5)
million , $(53) million , and $(49) million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and

music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the
transportation service provider.

The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased product and

shipping costs resulting from increased sales.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.

Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $16.2 billion , $21.7 billion , and $27.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018
. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping
rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher
sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering
low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.

Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal

technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.

25

Table of Contents

Fulfillment

Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service
centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are
primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and
related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network
and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect
customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because
payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment
processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs
as a percent of net sales.

The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to costs from expanding our

fulfillment network, which includes physical stores, and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels.

We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from

sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.

Marketing

We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer
referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes
in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see
a corresponding change in our marketing costs.

The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to payroll and related

expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.

While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective

worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.

Technology
and
Content

Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and

services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure
costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS
and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.

We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process

efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending
projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect
spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments
based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to an
increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing
products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.

General
and
Administrative

The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increases

in payroll and related expenses.

Other
Operating
Expense,
Net

Other operating expense, net was $167 million , $214 million , and $296 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and is primarily related to the amortization

of intangible assets.

Interest
Income
and
Expense

Our interest income was $100 million , $202 million , and $440 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated

money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of
invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.

Interest expense was $484 million , $848 million , and $1.4 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term

debt and capital and finance lease arrangements.

Our long-term debt was $24.7 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Our other long-term liabilities were $21.0 billion and $27.2

billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt and Note 6 — Other Long-
Term Liabilities” for additional information.

Other
Income
(Expense),
Net

Other income (expense), net was $90 million , $346 million , and $(183) million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of other income

(expense), net are related to foreign currency, equity warrant valuation, and equity securities gains.

Income
Taxes

Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of

jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,
audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),
changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,
competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.
Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-
deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.

The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,
lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to
claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the
effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the
impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities
resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the
accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting
implications of the U.S. Tax Act.

We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our provision for income taxes in 2017
was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset
by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We have recorded valuation
allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit.

We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In
performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of
future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In
Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.

Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit

of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the

27

Table of Contents

U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, and an increase in excess tax benefits
from stock-based compensation.

We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our

U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4
billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and
development credit.

See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.

Equity-Method
Investment
Activity,
Net
of
Tax

Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(96) million , $(4) million , and $9 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of this

activity during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 were our equity-method investment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorded in 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-

GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the
definition of non-GAAP financial measures.

We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and
equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated
statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —
Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”

Free
Cash
Flow

Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,”

which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow
measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 (in millions):

All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual

cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing
principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing
options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Guidance

We provided guidance on January 31, 2019 , in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect
Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 31, 2019 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially
affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of
growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”

First Quarter 2019 Guidance

•

•
•

Net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with first quarter 2018. This guidance
anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
Operating income is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in first quarter 2018.
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.

Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at

amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a
fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates
of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on
our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed
income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if
forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected

maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2018 (in millions, except percentages):

Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $25.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 .

Foreign Exchange Risk

During 2018 , net sales from our International segment accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our

internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the
functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our
intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as
foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the
remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the
prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior year.

We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of

foreign funds as of December 31, 2018 , of $13.8 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of
$690 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair
value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair
values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.

We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of
December 31, 2018 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 million, and $685 million,
recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”

See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of

Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.

32

Table of Contents

Investment Risk

As of December 31, 2018 , our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $942 million. Our equity and

equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $518 million of our investments as of December 31, 2018 , and are recorded at fair value, which
is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment
indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to
fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available
data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily
available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s

internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,
developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer
programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app
developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global
compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising.

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”

Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash

equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a
variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities
(collectively, the “Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,
Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are
used for, but not limited to, income taxes, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture
rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-

average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net
loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.

The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):

Revenue

Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and

rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple
performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine
stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.

A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:

Retail
sales
- We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the

customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.

Third-party
seller
services
- We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of

record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are
rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.

Subscription
services
- Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital

video, e-books, digital music, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that
represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is
recognized over the subscription period.

AWS
- Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone

selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity
delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized
ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.

Other
- Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or

impressions.

Return Allowances

Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in
“Accrued expenses and other” and were $567 million , $468 million , and $623 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance
were $1.5 billion , $1.8 billion , and $2.3 billion and deductions from the allowance were $1.5 billion , $1.9 billion , and $2.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .
Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $411 million , $406 million , and $519 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 ,
and 2018 , for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and

music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the
transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of
products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on
our consolidated statements of operations.

Vendor Agreements

We have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally

consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are
recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum
purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be
reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.

42

Table of Contents

Fulfillment

Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,
customer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and
preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller
transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include
amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.

Marketing

Marketing costs primarily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and

television advertising. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising
arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.

Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $5.0 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.2 billion in

2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Technology and Content

Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and

services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure
costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS
and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.
Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation expense and

rent; professional fees and litigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources,
among others.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value
of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over
the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,
and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period
estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level.

Other Operating Expense, Net

Other operating expense, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and

expenses related to legal settlements.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $21 million , $247 million , and $(206) million in 2016 , 2017 , and
2018 and equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity securities gains of $1
million , $18 million , and $145 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

43

Table of Contents

Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S.

Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings,
as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon
repatriation of such amounts.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are

stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider

many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of
future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.

We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position
for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and
which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at

the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to
measure fair value:

Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other
market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.

For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in

active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based
on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash
equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

As part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of

December 31, 2017 and 2018 , these warrants had a fair value of $441 million and $440 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated
balance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .
These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and

net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as
through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.

We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,

regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.

44

Table of Contents

We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our

products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with
contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements
consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur
additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.

Accounts Receivable, Net and Other

Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of
December 31, 2017 and 2018 , customer receivables, net, were $6.4 billion and $9.4 billion , vendor receivables, net, were $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion , and seller
receivables, net, were $692 million and $710 million . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides
funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory.

We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and
written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $237 million , $348 million , and $495 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were $451 million , $626
million , and $878 million , and deductions to the allowance were $403 million , $515 million , and $731 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

Software Development Costs

We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software

development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as
incurred.

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a

reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, finance, and capital lease
arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation is recorded
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for
our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation expense is
classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.

Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations

We categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other
incentives provided by the landlord. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the
commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold
improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.

We establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the
construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we
assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities
are accounted for as finance leases.

We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such
assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.

As disclosed in “Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019.

Goodwill

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step
impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the
reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a
second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate
the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating
expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.

We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2018 , and determined that goodwill is no t
impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test.
See “Note 4 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”

Other Assets

Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization;

video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than
one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets.

Video and Music Content

We obtain video and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which include both fixed and
variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available
for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are made and we
amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges from one to five
years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop
original content. Capitalized production costs associated with our original content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, which results in a
portion being expensed as incurred. These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer
streams in the first months after availability.

Investments

We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such
investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities
are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not

control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as
reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity -
method investment activity, net
of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations.

Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at

cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.

Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair

value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations.

We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity method investments, we also

evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and
quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery
occurs. Additionally, we

46

Table of Contents

assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee
securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the
decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the

assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an
asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.

For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,
probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived
assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale
in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less
costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Accrued Expenses and Other

Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations,

payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards

were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be
redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.

Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period.

Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 was
$6.1 billion , of which $5.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 , including adjustments related to the new revenue
recognition guidance. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of unearned revenue as of
December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have

not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $19.3
billion as of December 31, 2018 . The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue
recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.

Foreign Currency

We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are
denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated
at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses
including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense),
net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of
$62 million , $202 million , and $(186) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidance
and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective
approach and increased retained earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which are
now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We
changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably
over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated
among product sales and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenue
rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not
been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy.

The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales
driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion . Service sales also increased by approximately $3.0 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.

Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material
impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax

consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax
effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250
million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.

In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new
guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a
retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for
operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the
consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU
is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 with an immaterial
cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. This adoption approach will result in a balance sheet presentation
that will not be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU will result in the recognition of operating lease assets and
liabilities of approximately $21 billion , which includes the reclassification of finance leases to operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion , and the
derecognition of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities when we do not control the building during the construction period of approximately $1.5 billion .

Note 2 — CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money
market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at
fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair

(1) We revised our prior year presentation of gross property and equipment and total accumulated depreciation and amortization to include all property and

equipment in service, including equipment which is fully-depreciated, to conform to the current year presentation. Total property and equipment, net remains
unchanged for the prior year.

Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $6.4 billion , $8.8 billion , and $12.1 billion which includes amortization of property and equipment

acquired under capital leases of $3.8 billion , $5.4 billion , and $7.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Gross assets recorded under capital leases were $26.4
billion and $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with capital leases was $13.4 billion and $19.8 billion as of
December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner,

for accounting purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not
qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This is
principally due to our significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the
related leases’ terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-term
construction obligations are considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “Accrued expenses and
other.” Gross assets remaining under finance leases were $5.4 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated
with finance leases was $635 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As disclosed in “Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting
Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019.

Note 4 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

2016 Acquisition Activity

During 2016 , we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $103 million . The primary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were

individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.

51

Table of Contents

2017 Acquisition Activity

On May 12, 2017 , we acquired Souq Group Ltd. (“Souq”), an e-commerce company, for approximately $583 million , net of cash acquired, and on August

28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion , net of cash acquired. Both acquisitions are intended to expand
our retail presence. During 2017 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million . The primary reason for our other
2017 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.

2018 Acquisition Activity

On April 12, 2018 , we acquired Ring Inc. (“Ring”) for cash consideration of approximately $839 million , net of cash acquired, and on September 11, 2018 ,

we acquired PillPack, Inc. (“PillPack”) for cash consideration of approximately $753 million , net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings.
During 2018 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million . The primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to
acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.

Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.

Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our

Issued in November 2012, effective interest rate of the 2022 Notes was 2.66% .
Issued in December 2014, effective interest rates of the 2019, 2021, 2024, 2034, and 2044 Notes were 2.73% , 3.43% , 3.90% , 4.92% , and 5.11% .
Issued in August 2017, effective interest rates of the 2020, 2023, 2024, 2027, 2037, 2047, and 2057 Notes were 2.16% , 2.56% , 2.95% , 3.25% , 3.94% ,
4.13% , and 4.33% .

(4) Consists of $872 million of 2025 Notes issued in December 2017 in exchange for notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market

and $128 million of 2025 Notes issued by Whole Foods Market that did not participate in our December 2017 exchange offer. The effective interest rate of the
2025 Notes was 3.02% .

Interest on the Notes issued in 2012 is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November . Interest on the Notes issued in 2014 is payable semi-annually

in arrears in June and December . Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August. Interest on the 2025 Notes is
payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption
prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the November 2012 and the December 2014 Notes were used for general
corporate purposes. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due
in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $25.7 billion and $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and
2018 , which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.

In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables , which we
subsequently increased to $620 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is
available for a term of three years , bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“ LIBOR ”) plus 1.65% , and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the
undrawn portion. There were $592 million and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , which had a
weighted-average interest rate of 2.7% and 3.2% as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we

54

Table of Contents

have pledged $686 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility,
which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.8% and 6.0% as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . We used the net

proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level
2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

As of December 31, 2018 , future principal payments for our total debt were as follows (in millions):

In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured
commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were
no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 .

In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”)
with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion . As amended and restated, the Credit Agreement has a term of three years
, but it may be extended for up to three additional one -year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the
amended and restated Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50% , with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Tax Contingencies

We have recorded reserves for tax contingencies, inclusive of accrued interest and penalties, for U.S. and foreign income taxes. These reserves primarily
relate to transfer pricing and state income taxes, and are presented net of offsetting deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. See “Note 9 —

payment, if any.

Pledged Assets

As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $1.4 billion and $575 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable

securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and
trade letters of credit.

Suppliers

During 2018 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to

guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.

Other Contingencies

In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the
Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other
media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our
review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States
Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in
the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.”

Table of Contents

We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in

which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant
additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from
January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our
third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar
nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:

In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.à

r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany
seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the
German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of
products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced an
appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the
Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the
tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme
Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions
set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed
Austro-Mechana’s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher
Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. In
February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-
Mechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar
allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against Amazon
EU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and
Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.à r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to
customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court of
First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In
November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a
determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to
compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August
2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.
Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky. In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former
employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The
complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December
2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and
hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In
March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed
the district court’s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of

58

Table of Contents

appeals affirmed the district court’s decision. In June 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana
cases with prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services,
LLC for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private
Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Number
of Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,
enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of
Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January
2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter.

In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes
U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and
Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In
February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages
report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130 - $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

In October 2017, SRC Labs, LLC and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amazon Web Services, Inc.,

Amazon.com, Inc., and VADATA, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
certain AWS EC2 Instances infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,434,687, entitled “System and method for accelerating web site access and processing utilizing a computer
system incorporating reconfigurable processors operating under a single operating system image”; 7,149,867, entitled “System and method of enhancing efficiency
and utilization of memory bandwidth in reconfigurable hardware”; 7,225,324 and 7,620,800, both entitled “Multi-adaptive processing systems and techniques for
enhancing parallelism and performance of computational functions”; and 9,153,311, entitled “System and method for retaining DRAM data when reprogramming
reconfigurable devices with DRAM memory controllers.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, and a compulsory
on-going royalty. In February 2018, the Virginia district court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In
November 2018, the case was stayed pending resolution of eight review petitions filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the ‘324,
‘867, and ‘311 patents. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S.
Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an
unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of
wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

In June 2018, VoIP-Pal.com, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Technologies, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
District of Nevada. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Alexa calling and messaging system, the Alexa app, and Echo, Tap, and Fire devices with
Alexa support infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,537,762; 9,813,330; 9,826,002; and 9,948,549, all entitled “Producing Routing Messages For Voice Over IP
Communications.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In November 2018, the case
was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter.

services with H.265 functionality, including Amazon Elastic Transcoder, AWS Elemental Media Convert, AWS Elemental MediaLive, certain EC2 instances,

Note 9 — INCOME TAXES

In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-

based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds,
were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 .

The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,

lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to
claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the
effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the
impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million . This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities
resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% , after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the
accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting
implications of the U.S. Tax Act.

___________________
(1) The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.
(2)

Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and beginning in 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For 2017 and 2018, our tax
provision includes $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time
favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related
developments.

We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In
performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of
future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In
Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.

Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit

of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of
foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of

those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the
U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.

(1) Deferred tax assets are presented net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions and future capital

gains.

As of December 31, 2018 , our federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $627 million , $7.8

billion , and $919 million . The federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code and applicable foreign and state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
2029 , 2019 , and 2019 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billion . If not
utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . As of December 31, 2018 , our federal capital loss carryforwards for income tax
purposes was approximately $261 million . If not utilized, a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 .

Tax Contingencies

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax
positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes
will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the
impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

(1) As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $3.4 billion of accrued tax contingencies, of which $1.7 billion , if fully recognized, would decrease our

effective tax rate.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $107 million and

$127 million . Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 was $9 million , $40
million , and $20 million .

We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These
examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as
well as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the
2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that
would result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the
issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the
transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. In September 2017, the IRS appealed the decision to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal
or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to
significant additional tax liabilities.

In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to

the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission
announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the
European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and
ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,
consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In
December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be
without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions
including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.  We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional
assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter.

We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2019 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax
contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues
raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional
assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could
result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2018 . The actual amount of any change could vary significantly
depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.

Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses

“Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” based

65

Table of Contents

on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS
segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America
segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates
the Company’s business performance and manages its operations.

North
America

The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through

North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.

International

The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through

internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online
stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.

AWS

The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises,

government agencies, and academic institutions.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2018 . Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of December 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably

likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,
Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the
COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated

balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of

internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEMS HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM YOU OR HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN PROVIDED FOR.

Exhibit 10.7

AMAZON.COM, INC.

GLOBAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

TO:    <<Participant>>

You have been granted this restricted stock unit award (the " Award ") by Amazon.com, Inc. (the " Company ") pursuant to the Company's 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan (the " Plan "). The Award represents an unsecured and unfunded promise of the Company to deliver Common Stock of the Company in the future
subject to the fulfillment of the vesting conditions set forth in this Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.

1.

Introduction. The terms of the Award are as set forth in this Global Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement including any country-specific
terms in the Appendix hereto (the " Appendix ") (together, this " Agreement ") and in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which
means that this Agreement is limited by and subject to the express terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement
and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.
The most important terms of the Award are summarized as follows:

3.

4.

Award Date:

Number of Restricted Stock Units Subject to this Award:

Vesting Schedule: Subject to your continuous employment and the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 6 and 7,

the Award will vest according to the following schedule:

Vest Date              Number of Shares

The number of Restricted Stock Units, vesting schedule of the Restricted Stock Units, and Award Date with respect to this Award, all of which
are accessible to you through your brokerage account with the Company’s designated brokerage firm (“the Designated Broker”), are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement by reference if not set forth above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time you become an officer required to file reports pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
of  1934,  as  amended,  then  with  respect  to  any  part  of  this  Award  that  is  then  unvested,  vesting  shall  in  addition  be  contingent  on  and  subject  to
satisfaction of such performance criteria for such performance period as the Plan Administrator shall establish with specific reference to this Award, and
this Award shall be cancelled without the issuance of Common Stock if and to the extent any such performance criteria are not satisfied.

5.

Conversion  of  Restricted  Stock  Units  and  Issuance  of  Shares.  Upon  each  vesting  of  the  Award  (each,  a  "  Vest  Date  "),  one  share  of
Common Stock shall be issuable for each restricted stock unit that vests on such Vest Date (the “ Shares ”), subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this
Agreement. Thereafter, the Company will transfer such Shares to you upon satisfaction of any required Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 9). No fractional
shares shall be issued under this Agreement.

6.

Termination of Employment. The unvested portion of the Award will terminate automatically and be forfeited to the Company immediately
and without further notice upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment with the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason (including as a
result  of  death  or  disability),  except  to  the  extent  that  the  Plan  Administrator  has  provided  for  accelerated  vesting  in  the  event  of  death.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, in no event shall accelerated vesting on death apply if, at the time of grant of this Award or at any time thereafter, you become employed at level 11 or
above. No Shares shall be issued or issuable with respect to any portion of the Award that terminates unvested and is forfeited.

1

For purposes of the Award, your employment will be considered terminated as of the date the Company determines you are no longer actively providing
services to the Company or a Subsidiary (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment
laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or
determined by the Company, your right to continue to vest in the Award, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period ( e.g.
,
your  period  of  service  would  not  include  any  contractual  notice  period  or  any  period  of  "garden  leave"  or  similar  period  mandated  under  employment  laws,
statutory laws, regulatory laws or common laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any).

Unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, a transfer of employment or services between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
be considered a termination of employment. Further, unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, including through policies it may adopt from time to time
regarding part-time work arrangements or reduced work schedules, and except as otherwise required by local law, for purposes of this Award only, any reduction in
your regular hours of employment to less than thirty hours per week is deemed a termination of your employment with the Company or any Subsidiary. In case of
termination of your employment for Cause or for a violation of the Company’s code of business conduct and ethics, the Award shall automatically terminate upon
first  notification  to  you  of  such  termination,  unless  the  Plan  Administrator  determines  otherwise.  If  your  employment  is  suspended  pending  an  investigation  of
whether you should be terminated for Cause or for a violation of the Company’s code of business conduct and ethics, all of your rights under the Award likewise
may be suspended during the period of investigation. The Plan Administrator, the Vice President of Human Resources, the Associate General Counsel, Labor and
Employment, or any other officer of the Company delegated such authority by the Plan Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are
no  longer  actively  providing  services  to  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  or  when  your  rights  under  the  Award  may  be  suspended  pending  an  investigation  of
whether you should be terminated for Cause or a violation of the Company’s code of business conduct and ethics.

7.

Leave  of  Absence  and  Change  in  Work  Schedule.  Your  rights  under  the  Award  in  the  event  of  a  leave  of  absence  or  a  change  in  your
regularly scheduled hours of employment (other than a change addressed in Section 6 of this Agreement) will be affected in accordance with applicable Company
policies, including its leave of absence policy and policies regarding part-time work arrangements or reduced work schedules, and this Agreement. A copy of the
Company's leave of absence policy or other applicable policies may be obtained by contacting the Company's stock plan administration team.

8.

Right to Shares. You shall not have any right in, to or with respect to any of the Shares (including any voting rights or rights with respect to

dividends paid on the Common Stock) issuable under the Award until the Award is settled by the issuance of such Shares to you.

Responsibility for Taxes. You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, your employer
(the " Employer "), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to
your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Employer in its discretion to be an appropriate charge to you even if
legally applicable to the Company or the Employer (collectively, " Tax-Related Items ") is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount (if any)
withheld  by  the  Company  or  the  Employer.  You  further  acknowledge  that  (i)  neither  the  Company  nor  the  Employer  make  any  representation  or  undertaking
regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Award including without limitation, the grant, vesting, or settlement of the
Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Award; and (ii) the Company and the Employer do not commit to and are under no obligation to
structure the Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items
in  more  than  one  jurisdiction  between  the  Award  Date  and  the  date  of  any  relevant  taxable  or  tax  withholding  event,  as  applicable,  you  acknowledge  that  the
Company or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Items obligation, you must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax -Related Items in a manner acceptable to the Company and the Employer.

(b)

Payment of Tax-Related Items. Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that gives rise to a Tax-Related

(i)

By
Sale
of
Shares
. Unless you choose  to  satisfy  the  Tax-Related  Items  by some  other  means  in accordance  with clause  (ii)
below, your acceptance of this Award constitutes your instruction and authorization to the Company and the Designated Broker to sell on your behalf a
whole number of Shares from those Shares issued to you as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy your
obligation for Tax-Related Items. Such Shares will be sold on the day of the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Items ( e.g.
, a Vest Date) or as soon thereafter

2

as practicable. You will be responsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses,
costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. The number of Shares sold may be determined by considering any applicable withholding rates, including
maximum applicable rates, and to the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed your obligation for Tax-Related Items, the Company agrees to pay such excess in
cash  to  you  through  payroll  or  otherwise  as  soon  as  practicable  and  you  acknowledge  that  you  have  no  entitlement  to  the  equivalent  in  Shares.  You  further
acknowledge that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not
be sufficient to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items. Accordingly, you agree to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including the Employer as
soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax -Related Items that is not satisfied by the sale of Shares described
above.

(ii)

By
Wire
Transfer
or
Other
Means
.
At any time not less than five business days before any obligation for Tax-Related Items arises (
e.g.
,  a  Vest  Date),  you  may  elect  to  satisfy  your  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  delivering  to  the  Company  an  amount  that  the  Company  determines  is
sufficient  to satisfy  the Tax-Related  Items  by wire transfer  to such account as the Company may direct,  or such other means  as the Company may establish  or
permit. If you have made an election to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items by wire transfer or other means and, as determined by the Company, have not
adequately funded the obligation for Tax-Related Items within five business days before a Vest Date for this Award or any other award of restricted stock units
granted to you under the Plan, the Company reserves the right to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items pursuant to the method described above in 9(b)(i).

(c)

Right to Retain Shares or Cash. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver any Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares to
you until the obligation for any Tax-Related Items due in connection with the Award has been satisfied. To the extent permitted by law, the Company has the right
to retain, without notice, from Shares issuable under the Award, Shares having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. Further, the Company or the
Employer has the right to retain, without notice, from salary or other amounts payable to you, cash sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. If your obligation for
Tax-Related Items is satisfied by the Company withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the
vested Award, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. You agree to pay to the Company
or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in
the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means described in this Section 9.

10.

Registration. The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect  to  the  Shares  subject  to  the  Award.  The  Company  intends  to  maintain  this  registration  but  has  no  obligation  to  do  so.  If  the  registration  ceases  to  be
effective, you will not be able to transfer or sell Shares issued to you pursuant to the Award unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities laws
are available. Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might be unavailable. You agree that any resale by you of the Shares issued pursuant to the
Award shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of the
Securities  Act,  the  Exchange  Act  and  the  respective  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  and  any  other  law,  rule  or  regulation  including,  without
limitation, applicable securities law and exchange control regulations for your country of residence, as all may be amended from time to time. The Company shall
not be obligated to either issue the Shares (or any benefit in lieu of the Shares) or permit the resale of any Shares if such issuance or resale would violate any such
requirements.

11.

that:

the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;

(a)

the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, suspended or terminated by

benefits in lieu of awards, even if awards have been granted in the past;

(b)

your participation in the Plan is voluntary;

the Award and the Shares subject to the Award are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;

(f)

(g)

no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise as a consequence of your forfeiture of any unvested portion of the
Award as a result of the termination of your employment (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any) and, in consideration of the grant of the Award to which you are
otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any Subsidiary or the Employer;

(h)

the future value of the Common Stock subject to the Award is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty,

neither  the  Plan,  the  Award  nor  the  issuance  of  the  Shares  shall  create  a  right  to  employment  or  be  interpreted  to  form  an
employment contract with the Employer, the Company, or any Subsidiary and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, any Subsidiary or the Employer,
as applicable, to terminate your employment at any time;

for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and

(j)

(k)

the following provisions apply to you only if you are providing services outside the United States:

rate fluctuation between your local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the Award or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of
the Award or the subsequent sale of any Shares issued upon settlement.

12.

No  Advice  Regarding  Grant.  The  Company  is  not  providing  any  tax,  legal  or  financial  advice,  nor  is  the  Company  making  any
recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You are hereby advised to consult with your own
personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

13.

Employee Data Privacy. By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award:

you explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of any of your personal
data as described in this Agreement and any other restricted stock unit grant materials (“ Data ”) by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan;

(a)

(b)

you  understand  that  the  Company  and  the  Employer  may,  for  the  exclusive  purpose  of  implementing,  administering  and
managing the Plan, hold certain personal information about you, including but not limited to your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth,

you understand that Data will be transferred to, in electronic or other form, and stored by, a broker or stock plan service provider
selected by the Company, to assist the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of
the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country may have different data privacy laws and protections than your
country. You authorize the Company, the broker or stock plan services provider, and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in
the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the
sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

(d)

you understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and

4

manage your participation in the Plan.

(e)

you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis, and that if you do not consent, or if you
later seek to revoke your consent, your employment and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected, and the only adverse consequence of refusing
or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you restricted stock units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such
awards, and you therefore understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan; and

(f)      you understand that, if you reside outside of the United States, you may, at any time, request a list with the names and addresses of any
potential recipients of the Data, request access to the Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary

country set forth in the Appendix to this Agreement. To the extent any provision in the Appendix is inconsistent with a provision in the body of this Agreement, the
provision in the Appendix shall prevail. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the terms and conditions for such country will
