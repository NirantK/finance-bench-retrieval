Item 1. Business is an outline of our strategy and our businesses by SBU, including key financial drivers. Additional items that may have an

impact on our businesses are discussed in Item 1A.— Risk Factors and Item 3.— Legal Proceedings .

Executive Summary

Incorporated in 1981, AES is a diversified power generation and utility company, providing affordable, sustainable energy through our diverse
portfolio of thermal and renewable generation facilities as well as distribution businesses. Our vision is to be the world's leading sustainable power
company by leveraging our unique electricity platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions our
customers truly need. Our people share a passion to help meet the world's current and increasing energy needs, while providing communities and
countries the opportunity for economic growth due to the availability of reliable, affordable electric power.

Future growth across our company will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive wind, solar and gas generation. Growth in
renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation, but also presents significant potential for energy
storage. We are a leader in lithium ion, battery-based energy storage, with more than 400 MW in operation, under construction or in advanced
development across seven countries. We believe lithium ion-based energy storage will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based
generation mix. With our technological experience, presence in key markets and channel sales partnerships, we are positioned to capitalize on this
rapidly growing market.

Additionally, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure in Central America, where we are helping to displace oil-fired generation in favor

of a cheaper and cleaner alternative. In the United States, at IPL, we recently completed a multi-year rate-base investment in environmental
upgrades to our coal plants and are in the process of re-powering several units from coal to gas.

Segments

We are organized into six market-oriented strategic business units ("SBUs"): US (United States), Andes (Chile, Colombia, and Argentina),

Brazil , MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean), Europe , and Asia — which are led by our SBU Presidents. Within our six SBUs, we
have two lines of business. The first business line is generation, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to
customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The second business line is utilities, where we own and/or operate utilities to
generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental
sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.

The Company measures the operating performance of its SBUs using Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow, both of which are non-

GAAP measures. The Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2016 are shown below. The
percentages for Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by
SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for
reconciliation and definitions of Adjusted PTC and Proportional Free Cash Flow.

The following summarizes our businesses within our six SBUs.

Overview

Generation

We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 30,379 MW, excluding the generation capabilities of our integrated utilities. Our

generation fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs .

Performance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, fuel costs,

seasonality, weather variations and economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition.

Electricity Sales Contracts — Our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts ("contract sales") or under short-

term agreements in competitive markets ("short-term sales").

Contract Sales — Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts. Our medium-term contract sales have a term of 2 to 5 years,

while our long-term contracts have a term of more than 5 years. Across our portfolio, the average remaining contract term is 6 years.

In contract sales, our generation businesses recover variable costs including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-
based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or
enter into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion under the Fuel Costs section below). These contracts are intended to
reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel prices and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. These contracts also help us to
fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.

Capacity Payments and Contract Sales — Most of our contract sales include a capacity payment that covers projected fixed costs of the plant,

including fixed O&M expenses and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payment
be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by
matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for
which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity
payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales section below.

Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and fuel prices,
currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and
a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.

Short-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with an average term of

less than 2 years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market, or, in some cases, at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically
administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive
generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term
price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash
flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these
wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we
provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.

In certain markets, such as Argentina and Kazakhstan, a regulator establishes the prices for electricity and fuel and adjusts them periodically

for inflation, changes in fuel prices and other factors. In these cases, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.

Capacity Payments — Many of the markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to

provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are
typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in
excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in
the market. Our most significant capacity revenues are earned by our generation capacity in Ohio and Northern Ireland.

12

Plant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability,

operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales,
our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to
capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.

Fuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often
enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts have periodic adjustments for
changes in fuel cost indices. In those cases, we have fuel supply agreements with shorter terms to match those adjustments. For certain projects,
we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.

In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel
supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for
power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding
commodity price risk please see Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Form 10-K.

34% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S.
generation plants, and at our plant in Hawaii, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the
purchasing power of our fuel procurement.

33% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A few
exceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we purchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic, where we
import LNG to utilize in the local market.

27% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, wind and energy storage, which do not have significant

fuel costs.

6% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes oil, diesel and petroleum coke ("pet coke") for fuel. Oil and diesel are sourced locally at prices

linked to international markets, while pet coke is largely sourced from Mexico and the U.S.

Renewable Generation Facilities — We currently own and operate 8,228 MW (4,293 proportional MW) of renewable generation, including

hydro, wind, energy storage, solar, biomass and landfill gas.

Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns throughout

the year and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature,
solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In
competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.

Fixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacity

payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.

Competition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short-

term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.

Utilities

AES' seven utility businesses distribute power to 9.4 million people in three countries. AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation

capacity totaling 6,314  MW. The utility businesses have a variety of structures, ranging from integrated utility to pure transmission and distribution
businesses.

In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance

drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, reliability of service and
competition. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff — In exchange for the exclusive right to sell or distribute electricity in a franchise area, our utility

businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge retail customers for
electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.

13

Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed

regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator
and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are
important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are
recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.

The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its

tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon a certain usage level and may include a pass-through to the customer of costs that are not controlled by the
utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy. In addition to fuel and purchased energy,
other types of costs may be passed through to customers via an existing mechanism, such as certain environmental expenditures that are covered
under an environmental tracker at our utility in Indiana, IPL. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually
adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand
above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract with other retail energy suppliers directly and pay wheeling and other non-
bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.

The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage
uncollectible amounts, quality of service and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk
non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.

Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns throughout the year
and, therefore, the operating revenues and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. Additionally, weather
variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions and customers' historic
usage levels and patterns. The retail kWh sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are affected by changes in local economic activity, energy
efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.

Reliability of Service — Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those
standards may be specific with incentives or penalties for performance against these standards. In other cases, the standards are implicit and the
utility must operate to meet customer expectations.

Competition — Our integrated utilities, IPL and DP&L, operate as the sole distributor of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. Our

businesses own and operate all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Competition in the
regulated electric business is primarily from the on-site generation for industrial customers; however, in Ohio, customers in our service territory have
the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their generation service. Our integrated utilities, particularly DP&L, are exposed to the volatility in
wholesale prices to the extent our generating capacity exceeds the native load served under the regulated tariff and short-term contracts. See the
full discussion under the US SBU.

At our pure transmission and distribution businesses, such as those in Brazil and El Salvador, we face relatively limited competition due to

significant barriers to entry. At many of these businesses, large customers, as defined by the relevant regulator, have the option to both leave and
return to regulated service.

Development and Construction

We develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility businesses, new plants may be built in response to customer needs or to

comply with regulatory developments and are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our
investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is platform expansion opportunities, where we can add on to our existing
facilities in our key platform markets where we have a competitive advantage. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the
project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate
debt repayment and share buybacks.

In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity
contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners where it
is commercially attractive. For construction, we typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management
team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity
standards.

U.S. Businesses

U.S. Utilities

IPALCO

Business Description — IPALCO owns all of the outstanding common stock of IPL. IPL is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting,
distributing and selling electric energy to approximately 490,000 retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of
Indiana. IPL has an exclusive right to provide electric service to those customers. IPL's service area covers about 528 square miles with an
estimated population of approximately 939,000. IPL owns and operates four generating stations. IPL’s largest generating station, Petersburg, is
coal-fired. The second largest station, Harding Street, has converted its coal-fired units to natural gas and uses natural gas and fuel oil to power
combustion turbines. The third, Eagle Valley, retired its coal-fired units in April 2016 and their CCGT is expected to be completed in the first half of
2018. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. As of December 31, 2016,
IPL's net electric generation capacity for winter is 2,993 MW and net summer capacity is 2,878 MW.

Market Structure — IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in the MISO. MISO is a RTO, which maintains functional control

over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. IPL
offers the available electricity production of each of its generation assets into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. MISO operates on a merit
order dispatch, considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region.

Regulatory Framework - Retail Ratemaking — In addition to the regulations referred to below in Other Regulatory Matters , IPL is subject to
regulation by the IURC with respect to IPL's services and facilities; retail rates and charges; the issuance of long-term securities; and certain other
matters. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL's business is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally
imposed by state public utility commissions. IPL's tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges,

16

which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. The IURC gives consideration to all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes
including a fair return on the fair value of the utility property used and useful in providing service to customers. In addition, IPL's rates include various
adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail load
requirements, referred to as the FAC, and (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations
referred to as the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery Adjustment. These components function somewhat independently of one another, but
the overall structure of IPL's rates and charges would be subject to review at the time of any review of IPL's basic rates and charges.

In March 2016, the IURC issued an order authorizing IPL to increase its basic rates and charges by approximately $31 million annually. On

December 22, 2016, IPL filed a petition with the IURC for authority to increase its basic rates and charges, primarily to recover the cost of the new
Eagle Valley CCGT. The Eagle Valley CCGT was previously expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, but is now expected to be completed
in the first half of 2018. To address this change, on February 24, 2017, IPL filed a motion to withdraw the case without prejudice or alternatively
amend the petition at a later date. No assurances can be given as to the timing or outcome of this proceeding.

Environmental Regulation — For information on compliance with environmental regulations see Item 1. —United States Environmental and

Land-Use Legislation and Regulations .

Replacement Generation — IPL has several generating units that have been recently retired or refueled. These units were primarily coal-fired

and represented 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this generation, IPL has approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at its Eagle Valley
Station site in Indiana and refuel its Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (approximately 100 MW net capacity each) with a
total budget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $632 million. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service
allowance for debt and equity funds used during construction, and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling
project. These costs to build and operate the CCGT and the refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until
the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after the assets have been placed in service. The CCGT is expected to be completed
in the first half of 2018, and the refueling project was completed in December 2015.

In July 2015 IPL received approval from the IURC for a CPN to refuel the Harding Street Station Unit 7 from coal to natural gas (about 410 MW

net capacity). The Harding Street Station Unit 7 conversion was completed in the second quarter of 2016.

Key Financial Drivers — IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices. In

addition, IPL's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including but not limited to:

•

•

•

rate case outcomes

the timely recovery of capital expenditures through base rate growth

the passage of new legislation or implementation of regulations

Construction and Development — IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and

compliance with environmental laws and regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall
performance. Refer to the section above for a description of our major construction projects.

DPL

Business Description — DPL is an energy holding company whose principal subsidiaries include DP&L and AES Ohio Generation, LLC.

DP&L generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity to approximately 519,000 customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central

Ohio. DP&L, solely or through jointly owned facilities, owns 2,510 MW of generation capacity and numerous transmission facilities.

AES Ohio Generation, LLC owns peaking generation units representing 556 MW located in Ohio and Indiana.

On January 1, 2016, DPL closed on the sale of DPLER to Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. DPLER, a competitive retail marketer, sold retail
electricity to more than 124,000 retail customers in Ohio and Illinois while owned by DPL. Approximately 110,000 of those customers were also
distribution customers of DP&L in Ohio.

Market Structure — Since January 2001, electric customers within Ohio have been permitted to choose to purchase power under a contract

with a CRES Provider or to continue to purchase power from their local utility

17

under SSO rates established by the tariff. DP&L and other Ohio utilities continue to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in their state
certified territories, and DP&L has the obligation to provide retail generation service to customers that did not choose an alternative supplier.
Beginning in 2014, a portion of the SSO generation supply was no longer supplied by DP&L, but was provided by third parties through a competitive
bid process. A total of 10%, 60% and 100% of the SSO load was sourced through competitive bid in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The PUCO
maintains jurisdiction over DP&L's delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services. The PUCO has issued extensive rules on how and
when a customer can switch generation suppliers, how the local utility will interact with CRES Providers and customers, including for billing and
collection purposes, and which elements of a utility's rates are "bypassable" (i.e., avoided by a customer that elects a CRES Provider) and which
elements are "non-bypassable" (i.e., charged to all customers receiving a distribution service irrespective of what entity provides the retail generation
service).

DP&L is a member of PJM. The PJM RTO operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of Pennsylvania, New

Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. PJM has an integrated
planning process to identify potential needs for additional transmission to be built to avoid future reliability problems. PJM also runs the day-ahead
and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.

As a member of PJM, DP&L is also subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC. Prior to 2015, the

RPM was PJM's capacity construct. In 2015, PJM implemented a new CP program, replacing the RPM model. The CP program offers the potential
for higher capacity revenues, combined with substantially increased penalties for non-performance or under-performance during certain periods
identified as "capacity performance hours." This linkage between non- or under-performance during specific hours means that a generation unit that
is generally performing well on an annual basis, may incur substantial penalties if it happens to be unavailable for service during some capacity
performance hours. Similarly, a generation unit that is generally performing poorly on an annual basis may avoid such penalties if its outages
happen to occur only during hours that are not capacity performance hours. An annual “stop-loss” provision exists that limits the size of penalties to
150% of the net cost of new entry, which is a value computed by PJM. This level is likely to be larger than the capacity price established under the
CP program, so that there is potential that participation in the CP program could result in capacity penalties that exceed capacity revenues. The
purpose of the RPM and CP Program is to enable PJM to obtain sufficient resources to reliably meet the needs of electric customers within the PJM
footprint. PJM conducts an auction to establish the price by zone.

The PJM CP auctions are held three years in advance for a period covering 12 months starting from June 1. Auctions for the period covering

June 1, 2020 through May 30, 2021 are expected to take place in May 2017. Future auction results are dependent upon various factors including the
demand and supply situation, capacity additions and retirements and any changes in the current auction rules related to bidding for demand
response and energy efficiency resources in the capacity auctions. For DPL-owned generation, applicable capacity prices through the auction year
2019/20 are as follows:

The above tables reflect the capacity prices after the transitional auctions discussed earlier. Substantially all of DP&L's capacity cleared in the

CP auction. The results of these auctions could have a significant effect on DP&L's revenues in the future.

Regulatory Framework - Retail Regulation and Rate Structure — DP&L is subject to regulation by the PUCO, for its distribution services and

facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio, energy efficiency program requirements and
certain other matters. DP&L's rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges that are set and approved by the PUCO
after public hearings. In addition, DP&L's rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs
incurred to comply with alternative energy, renewables, energy efficiency, and economic development costs. These components function
independently of one another, but the overall structure of DP&L's retail rates and charges are subject to the rules and regulations established by the
PUCO.

Since Ohio is deregulated, and allows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service at

SSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider.

18

SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established based on DP&L's most recently approved ESP. DP&L's distribution
rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of
providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed
regulated asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. DP&L's wholesale transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.

Although it had been in effect since January 2014, on June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio ("Court") issued an opinion in the appeal of
DP&L’s ESP (ESP 2) that had been approved by the PUCO for the years 2014-2016 and which, among other matters, permitted DP&L to collect a
non-bypassable Service Stability Rider equal to $110 million per year from 2014-2016 and required DP&L to conduct competitive bid auctions to
procure generation supply for SSO service. DP&L's own generation was phased-out of supplying SSO service over the three year period and
beginning January 1, 2016 DP&L's SSO was 100% sourced through the competitive bid. In the opinion, the Court stated that the PUCO’s approval
of ESP 2 was reversed. In view of that reversal, DP&L filed a motion to withdraw ESP 2 and implement rates consistent with those in effect prior to
2014 (ESP 1). Those rates will be in effect until rates consistent with DP&L’s pending February 22, 2016 ESP (ESP 3) filing are approved and
effective.

DP&L originally filed its ESP 3 seeking an effective date of January 1, 2017. On October 11, 2016, DP&L amended the application requesting

to recover $145 million per year for seven years supporting the alternative described in the original filing, named the Distribution Modernization
Rider. This plan establishes the terms and conditions for DP&L's SSO beginning June 1, 2017 to customers that do not choose a competitive retail
electric supplier.  In its plan, DP&L recommends including renewable energy attributes as part of the product that is competitively bid, and seeks
recovery of approximately $11 million of regulatory assets. The plan also proposes a new Distribution Investment Rider to allow DP&L to recover
costs associated with future distribution equipment and infrastructure needs. Additionally, the plan establishes new riders set initially at zero, related
to energy reductions from DP&L's energy efficiency programs, and certain environmental liabilities the Company may incur.

On January 30, 2017 DP&L, in conjunction with nine intervening parties, filed a settlement in the ESP 3 case, which is subject to PUCO

approval. DP&L and the intervening parties agreed to a six-year settlement that provides a framework for energy rates and defines components
which include, but are not limited to, the following:

• The establishment of a five-year Distribution Modernization Rider designed to collect $90 million in revenue per year to pay debt obligations at

DPL and DP&L and position DP&L to modernize and/or maintain its transmission and distribution infrastructure;

• The establishment of a Distribution Investment Rider for distribution investments, with one component designed to collect $35 million in revenue

per year to enable the implementation of smart grid and advanced metering, ending after the fifth year of the term of the ESP,

• A commitment by the Company to separate DP&L’s generation assets from its transmission and distribution assets (if approved by FERC);
• A commitments to commence the sale process of our ownership interests in the Zimmer, Miami Fort and Conesville coal-fired generation plants

and;

• A commitment to develop or procure wind and/or solar energy projects in Ohio,
• Restrictions on DPL making dividend or tax sharing payments, various other riders, and competitive retail market enhancements.

A hearing on the stipulation has been scheduled for March 2017. A final decision by the PUCO is expected at the end of Q2 or early Q3 2017.

If the PUCO agrees to the proposed settlement, the average residential customer in the DP&L service territory, using 1,000 kWh on DP&L's
Standard Service Offer, can expect a monthly bill increase of $2.39. There can be no assurance that the ESP 3 stipulation will be approved as filed
or on a timely basis, and if the final ESP provides for terms that are more adverse than those submitted in DP&L's stipulation, our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially impacted.

On November 30, 2015 DP&L filed an application to increase its distribution rate case using a 12-month test year of June 1, 2015 to May 31,

2016 to measure revenue and expenses and a date certain of September 30, 2015 to measure its asset base. The Company is seeking an increase
to distribution revenues of $66 million per year. The Company has asked for recovery of certain regulatory assets as well as two new riders that
would allow the Company to recover certain costs on an ongoing basis. It has proposed a modified straight-fixed variable rate design in an effort to
decouple distribution revenues from electric sales. If approved as filed the rates are expected to have a total bill impact of approximately 4% on a
typical residential customer.

Environmental Regulation — In relation to MATS, DPL does not expect to incur material capital expenditures to ensure compliance. For more

information see Item 1. —United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation

19

and Regulations .

Key Financial Drivers — DPL financial results are driven by retail demand, weather, energy efficiency and wholesale prices on financial results.

In addition, DPL financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

• PJM capacity prices

• Outcome of DP&L's pending ESP 3 case, including the amount of non-bypassable revenue

• Outcome of DP&L's pending distribution rate case

• Operational performance of generation facilities

• Recovery in the power market, particularly as it relates to an expansion in dark spreads

• Sale or transfer to a DPL affiliate of DP&L generation assets

• DPL's ability to reduce its cost structure

Construction and Development — Planned construction additions primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to DP&L's power plant

equipment and transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial
and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments and changing environmental standards, among other factors.

DPL is projecting to spend an estimated $414 million in capital projects for the period 2017 through 2019 with 65% attributable to Transmission
and Distribution. DPL's ability to complete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by its financial condition, the availability
of internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds. We expect to finance these construction additions with a combination of cash on hand,
short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows from operations.

U.S. Generation

Business Description — In the U.S., we own a diversified generation portfolio in terms of geography, technology and fuel source. The principal
markets and locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the Western Electric Coordinating
Council, PJM, Southwest Power Pool Electric Energy Network and Hawaii. AES Southland, in the Western Electric Coordinating Council, is our most
significant generating business.

Many of our U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in

availability has a direct impact on financial performance. The plants are generally eligible for availability bonuses on an annual basis if they meet
certain requirements. In addition to plant availability, fuel cost is a key business driver for some of our facilities.

AES Southland

Business Description — In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California, with

an installed gross capacity of 3,941 MW, accounting for approximately 5% of the state's installed capacity and 17% of the peak demand of Southern
California Edison. The three coastal power plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important
role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California.

Market Structure — All of AES Southland's capacity is contracted through a long-term agreement (the “Tolling Agreement”), which expires in
May 31, 2018. A Resource Adequacy agreement has been executed that covers the period from June 1, 2018 through 2020, but it is still subject to
approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. Under the current Tolling Agreement, AES Southland's largest revenue driver is unit
availability, as approximately 98% of its revenue comes from availability-related payments. Historically, AES Southland has generally met or
exceeded its contractual availability requirements under the Tolling Agreement and may capture bonuses for exceeding availability requirements in
peak periods.

Under the Tolling Agreement, the offtaker provides gas to the three facilities thus AES Southland is not exposed to significant fuel price risk. If
the units operate better than the guaranteed efficiency, AES Southland gets credit for the gas that is not consumed. Conversely, AES Southland is
responsible for the cost of fuel in excess of what would have been consumed had the guaranteed efficiency been achieved. The business is also
exposed to replacement power costs for a limited period if dispatched by the offtaker and not able to meet the required generation.

AES Southland delivers electricity into the California ISO's market through its Tolling Agreement counterparty.

Environmental Regulation — For a discussion of environmental regulatory matters affecting U.S. Generation, see Item 1. —United States

Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.

Re-powering — In October 2014, AES Southland was awarded 20-year contracts by SCE to provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-fired

generation and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based energy storage. In addition to replacing older gas-fired plants with more efficient gas-fired
capacity, SCE chose advanced energy storage as a cost effective way to ensure critical power system reliability. This new storage resource will
provide operational flexibility, enabling the efficient dispatch of other generating plants, lowering cost and emissions and supporting the on-going
addition of renewable power sources.

This new capacity will be built at the Company's existing power plant sites in Huntington Beach and Alamitos Beach. For the gas-fired capacity,

financing agreements are expected to be completed in mid-2017 with construction expected to begin shortly thereafter, and commercial operation
scheduled for 2020. For the energy storage capacity, commercial operation is scheduled for 2021.

AES is pursuing permits to build both the gas-fired and energy storage capacity and will complete the licensing process before financial close.

The total cost for these projects is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion, which will be funded with a combination of non-recourse debt
and AES equity.

Key Financial Drivers — AES Southland's contractual availability is the single most important driver of operations. Its units are generally
required to achieve at least 86% availability in each contract year. AES Southland has historically met or exceeded its contractual availability.

Additional U.S. Generation Businesses

Business Description — Additional businesses include thermal, wind, and solar generating facilities, of which AES Hawaii, our U.S. wind

generation businesses and distributed solar are the most significant.

• AES Hawaii — AES Hawaii receives a fuel payment from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 2022, which is based on a fixed rate indexed to the

Gross National Product - Implicit Price Deflator. Since the fuel payment is not directly linked to market prices for fuel, the risk arising from
fluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii.

To mitigate the risk from such fluctuations, AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments that end in December 2018; the
business could be subject to variability in coal pricing beginning in January 2019. To mitigate fuel risk beyond December 2018, AES Hawaii plans
to seek additional fuel purchase commitments on favorable terms. However, if market prices rise and AES Hawaii is unable to procure coal
supply on favorable terms, the financial performance of AES Hawaii could be materially and adversely affected.

• U.S. Wind — AES has 736 MW of wind capacity in the U.S., located in California, Texas and West Virginia. Typically, these facilities sell under
long-term PPAs. AES financed most of these projects with tax equity structures. The tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic
attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity
structures, this could result in a net loss to AES consolidated results in periods in which the facilities report net income. These non cash net
losses will be expected to reverse during the life of the facilities. Some of the wind projects are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their
revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations.

Buffalo Gap is located in Texas and is comprised of three wind projects with an aggregate generation capacity of 522 MW. Each wind project
operates its own PPA with the exception of Buffalo Gap III. The energy price of the entire production of Buffalo Gap I is guaranteed by a PPA
expiring in 2021. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II guarantees the energy price of 80% of the installed capacity while the energy price for the remaining
20% is dictated by the prices in the ERCOT market. The PPA of Buffalo Gap II expires in December 2017. Once the PPAs expire, the entire
installed capacity of Buffalo Gap will be exposed to the volatility of energy prices in the ERCOT market which could adversely affect revenues.

Laurel Mountain is a wind project located in West Virginia with an installed capacity of 98 MW. Laurel Mountain does not operate under a long-
term contract and sells its entire capacity and power generated into the PJM market. The volatility and fluctuations of energy prices in PJM have
a direct impact in the results of Laurel Mountain.

AES manages the wind portfolio as part of its broader investments in the U.S., leveraging operational and commercial resources to supplement
the experienced subject matter experts in the wind industry to achieve optimal results.

21

• AES Distributed Energy — AES has 103 MW of solar capacity in the U.S., located across multiple states. Distributed Energy's Commercial and

Utility division, which comprised 89 MW of solar capacity as of December 31, 2016, sells electricity generated by photovoltaic solar energy
systems to public sector, utility, and non-profit entities through power purchase agreements. AES has added 33 MW of commercial and utility
capacity in 2016. A majority of this new capacity has been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equity
investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based on
certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in a net loss to AES consolidated results in periods in which the facilities
report net income. These non cash net losses will be expected to reverse during the life of the facilities.

AES manages the Distributed Energy portfolio as part of its broader investments in the U.S., leveraging operational and commercial resources to
supplement the experienced subject matter experts in the solar industry to achieve optimal results.

Market Structure — For the non-renewable businesses included in our additional U.S. generation facilities, coal and natural gas are used as
the primary fuels. Coal has prices that are set by market factors internationally while natural gas is generally set domestically. Price variations for
these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses, and the prices of these fuels have been
subject to volatility in recent years.

Many of these generation businesses have entered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some coal-fired power plant

businesses in the U.S. with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment that is partially based on
the market price of coal. In addition, these businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their
PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' global sourcing program
and fuel flexibility. Revenue may change materially as prices in fuel markets fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should not be materially
changed when market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker.

Regulatory Framework — Several of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as QFs as defined under the PURPA. These
businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation under PURPA requirements to purchase power
from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing
utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce
electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility's
total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as
its energy input and meet certain size criteria.

Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under EPAct 1992. These

businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-
party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale
power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission,
that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving
regulated affiliates of the seller. To prevent market manipulation, FERC requires sellers with market-based rate authority to file certain reports,
including a triennial updated market power analysis for markets in which they control certain threshold amounts of generation.

Other Regulatory Matters — The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal

regulation, as implemented by the U.S. FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit
corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules for the most part govern such
items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and
incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters.

Environmental Regulation — For a discussion of environmental laws and regulations affecting the U.S. business, see Item 1.— United States

Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations .

Key Financial Drivers — U.S. Generation's financial results are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into long-term fuel

contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major maintenance requiring units to be off-line is performed during
periods when power demand is typically lower. The financial results of U.S. Wind are primarily driven by increased production due to faster and less

22

turbulent wind, and reduced turbine outages. In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results for the wind projects that are
operating without long-term contracts for all or some of their capacity.

Construction and Development — Planned capital projects include the AES Southland re-powering described above. In addition to the new
construction projects, U.S. Generation performs capital projects related to major plant maintenance, repairs, and upgrades to be compliant with new
environmental laws and regulations.

Andes SBU

Generation — Our Andes SBU has generation facilities in three countries — Chile, Colombia and Argentina. AES Gener, which owns all of our

assets in Chile, Chivor in Colombia and TermoAndes in Argentina, as detailed below, is a publicly listed company in Chile. AES has a 66.7%

Andes Businesses

Chile

Business Description — In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the

two principal markets: the SIC and SING. In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Gener is the second largest generation operator in Chile
with a calculated installed capacity of 4,131 MW, excluding energy storage and TermoAndes, and a market share of approximately 18% as of
December 31, 2016.

AES Gener owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener's
installed capacity is located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener's
portfolio is composed of hydroelectric, coal, gas, diesel, solar photovoltaic and biomass facilities, that allows the businesses to operate under a
variety of market and hydrological conditions, manage AES Gener's contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers and, as
required, provide backup energy to the spot market.

AES Gener has experienced significant growth in recent years by responding to market opportunities. The company successfully completed a

first expansion phase between 2007 and 2014 that added 6 new power plants totaling 1,677 MW. It continued to grow in Chile through its second
expansion phase that will add 1,236 MW. As of the end of 2016, AES Gener has completed the construction of Guacolda Unit 5 (152 MW),
Cochrane (532 MW) and Andes Solar (21 MW). Additionally, we continue to advance in the construction of the 531 MW Alto Maipo run-of-the-river
hydroelectric plant in the SIC.

Our commercial policy in Chile aims to maximize margin while reducing cash flow volatility. In order to achieve this, we contract a significant

portion of our baseload capacity, currently coal and hydroelectric, under long-term agreements with a diversified customer base, that includes both
regulated and unregulated customers. Power plants that are not considered within our baseload capacity (higher variable cost units, mainly diesel
and gas fired

24

units) operate during scarce system supply conditions, such as dry hydrological conditions and plant outages, selling their energy in the spot market.
In Chile, sales on the spot market are made only to other generation companies (entities that are members of the Economic Load Dispatch Center -
"CISEN") at the system marginal cost. In anticipation of the SIC and SING interconnection, the new Transmission Law created the CISEN, an entity
that will merge both system operators into one.

AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 11 years, with regulated distribution
companies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include both fixed and
variable payments along with indexation mechanisms that periodically adjust prices based on the generation cost structure related to the United
States Consumer Price Index, the international price of coal, and in some cases, with pass-through of fuel and regulatory costs, including changes in
law.

In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives firm capacity payments for contributing to the system's ability to meet peak demand.

These payments are added to the final electricity price paid by both unregulated and regulated customers. In each system, the CISEN annually
determines the firm capacity amount allocated to each power plant. A plant's firm capacity is defined as the capacity that it can guarantee at peak
hours during critical conditions, such as droughts, taking into account statistical information regarding maintenance periods and water inflows in the
case of hydroelectric plants. The capacity price is fixed by the National Energy Commission in the semiannual node price report and indexed to the
United States Consumer Price Index and other relevant indices.

Market Structure — Chile has two main power systems, largely as a result of its geographic shape and size. The SIC is the largest of these
systems, with an installed capacity of 17,543 MW as of December 31, 2016. The SIC serves approximately 92% of the Chilean population, including
the densely populated Santiago Metropolitan Region, and represents 75% of the country's electricity demand. The SING serves about 6% of the
Chilean population, representing 25% of Chile's electricity consumption, and mainly supplies mining companies.

In 2016, thermoelectric generation represented 67% of the total generation in Chile. In the SIC, thermoelectric generation represents 48% of

installed capacity, required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric output and is critical to guaranteeing reliable and dependable electricity
supply under dry hydrological conditions. In the SING, which includes the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, thermoelectric capacity
represents 92% of installed capacity. The fuels used for generation, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices.

In the SIC, where hydroelectric plants represent a large part of the system's installed capacity, hydrological conditions largely influence plant

dispatch and, therefore, spot market prices, given that river inflows, snow melting and initial water levels in reservoirs largely determine the dispatch
of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants. Rainfall and snowfall occur in Chile principally in the southern cone winter season
(June to August) and during the remainder of the year precipitation is scarce. When rain is abundant, energy produced by hydroelectric plants can
amount to more than 70% of total generation. In 2016 hydroelectric generation represented 36% of total energy production within the SIC, and 27%
of the country’s total energy production.

Solar and wind installed capacity represents a small but growing part of the total capacity installed. In the SIC, solar accounts for 3% of the
power generation and 7% of the system’s installed capacity while in the SING solar accounts for 4% of the power generation and 6% of the system’s
capacity. As for wind, in the SIC, wind contributes with 4% of the power generation and 7% of the system’s capacity, while in the SING wind
generation represents 1% of the power generation and with 2% of the system’s capacity.

Regulatory Framework — The government entity that has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system is the Ministry of Energy,
acting directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. The electricity sector is divided into
three segments: generation, transmission and distribution. In general terms, generation and transmission expansion are subject to market
competition, while transmission operation and distribution, are subject to price regulation. The transmission segment consists of companies that
transmit the electricity produced by generation companies at high voltage. The individual and joint participation of companies operating in any other
segment of the electricity sector cannot exceed 8% and 40%, respectively, of the total investment value of the national transmission system.

Companies in the SIC and the SING that own generation, transmission, sub-transmission or additional transmission facilities, as well as
unregulated customers directly connected to transmission facilities, are coordinated through the CISEN, which minimizes the operating costs of the
electricity system, while meeting all service quality and reliability requirements. The principal purpose of the CISEN is to ensure that the most
efficient electricity generation available to meet demand is dispatched to customers. The CISEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their
variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost.

25

All generators can commercialize energy through contracts with distribution companies for their regulated and unregulated customers or

directly with unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 2MW. Customers with
connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 2.0 MW can opt for a Regulated or Unregulated regime for a minimum period of four years. By law, both
regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all of their electricity requirements under contract. Generators may also sell energy
to other power generation companies on a short-term basis. Power generation companies may engage in contracted sales among themselves at
negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile, under contract and on the spot market, are denominated in U.S. Dollars,
although payments are made in Chilean Pesos.

In July 2016, modifications to the Transmission Law were enacted. This Law establishes that the transmission system will be completely paid

for by the end-users, gradually allocating the costs on the demand side from year 2019 through 2034.

Environmental Regulation — In 2011, a regulation on air emission standards for thermoelectric power plants became effective. This regulation
provides for stringent limits on emission of PM and gases produced by the combustion of solid and liquid fuels, particularly coal. For existing plants,
including those currently under construction, the new limits for PM emissions went into effect at the end of 2013, and the new limits for SO 2 , NO x
and mercury emission were in effect since mid-2016, except for those plants operating in zones declared saturated or latent zones (areas at risk of
or affected by excessive air pollution), where these emission limits became effective in June 2015. In order to comply with the new emission
standards, AES Gener initiated investments in Chile at its older coal facilities (Ventanas I and II and Norgener I and II, constructed between 1964
and 1997) in 2012. As of December 31, 2016, AES Gener has concluded investments of approximately $229 million in order to comply within the
required time frame. Additionally, its equity method investee Guacolda started the installation of new emission control equipment during 2013, and
concluded investments of approximately $209 million in order to comply within the required time frame.

On March 29, 2016, the Health Ministry enacted Supreme Decree N°43 (“DS 43”) ruling “Storage of Hazardous Materials”, modifying the

current applicable rules. This regulation will become fully effective in March 2018 for structural improvements of currently authorized storage
facilities. The estimated investment required to comply with DS 43 would be approximately $15 million.

During 2016, the Environmental Ministry worked on upgrading the Atmospheric Decontamination Plans for Santiago, Ventanas and Huasco

areas, each of which, as of December 31, 2016, are currently under different stages of progress. Nueva Renca, Ventanas and Guacolda power
plants may require an improvement of their operational practices and additional investments to meet the expected new requirements during the year
following the enactment of the Decontamination Plan, which is expected for mid 2017.

Chilean law requires every electricity generator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations with Non-conventional Renewable

Energy ("NCREs"). In October 2013, the NCRE law was amended, increasing the NCRE requirements. The law distinguishes between energy
contracts executed before and after July 1, 2013. For contracts executed between August 31, 2007 and July 1, 2013, the NCRE requirement is
equal to 5% in 2014 with annual contract increases of 0.5% until reaching 10% in 2024. The NCRE requirement for contracts executed after July 1,
2013 is equal to 5% in 2013, with annual increases of 1% thereafter until reaching 12% in 2020, and subsequently annual increases of 1.5% until it
is equal to 20% in 2025. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by developing their own NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar,
biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric technology), purchasing NCREs from qualified generators or by paying the applicable fines for non-
compliance. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Gener's own solar and biomass power plants and by purchasing
NCREs from other generation companies. It has sold certain water rights to companies that are developing small hydro projects, entering into power
purchase agreements with these companies in order to promote development of these projects, while at the same time meeting the NCRE
requirements. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet the future requirements.

In September 2014 a new tax law was enacted. The new law introduces an emission tax, or "green tax", that assesses the emissions of PM,

SO 2 , NO x and CO 2 produced for installations with an installed capacity over 50 MW. The first annual payment shall be made in April 2018 for
emissions produced in 2017. In the case of CO 2 , the tax will be equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. In the SING, all PPAs have "change of law"
clauses, which would allow the company to transfer this cost to customers. In the SIC, costs can only be passed through to unregulated customers,
as existing PPAs with distribution companies do not have change of law clauses. According to its PPAs, the company is currently discussing the
pass-through mechanism with each client. Additionally, the new tax systems introduced by the new tax laws enacted in February 2016 will be
effective from January 1, 2017 onwards. The statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses will increase from 25% to 25.5% in 2017
and to 27%

26

for 2018 and future years. See Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates — Income Taxes for further details of the impacts of these new laws.

In June 2015, the Chilean government published Decree N°7/2015, which allows the export of energy generated by plants not dispatched in

the SING to Argentina using the transmission line connecting the SING with the SADI. This transmission line is owned by AES Gener and has a
capacity of approximately 600 MW, but will be operated at 200 MW according to the government permit and related technical studies. AES Gener
signed an agreement with CAMMESA and Chilean generators to export electricity to Argentina. In December 2016, Decree N° 7/2015 was amended
to allow the export of energy generated by plants dispatched into the SING to Argentina. During 2016, energy exported to Argentina reached 102
GWh.

Key Financial Drivers — Hedge levels at Gener provide some certainty and clarity on the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial

results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Dry hydrology scenarios reduce hydro generation

Forced outages may impact earnings

Changes in current regulatory rulings could alter the ability to pass through or recover certain costs

AES is exposed to the fluctuation of the Chilean peso, which may pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some
residual risk to earnings remains

Tax policy changes

Current legislation is trending towards promoting renewable energy and strengthening regulations on thermal generation assets, posing a risk
to future coal margins

• Market price risk when re-contracting

Construction and Development — Since 2007, AES Gener has constructed and commissioned approximately 2,400 MW of new capacity,
representing a significant portion of the capacity increase in the SIC and SING during the period. During 2016, AES Gener achieved important
milestones related to the construction of their projects:

•
•
•

Cochrane project began operations (Unit 2 on October 12 and Unit 1 on July 9) adding 532 MW to the SING.
Cochrane Energy Storage began operations in October 2016 adding 20 MW of batteries contributing to system stability in the SING.
Andes Solar with 21 MW began operations in May 2016

Additionally, in the SIC, we continue advancing in the construction of our Alto Maipo project, a 531 MW two unit run-of-river hydroelectric
power plant, adjacent to our existing Alfalfal plant, located 50 km from Santiago. Alto Maipo is the largest project in construction in the SIC market
and it includes 67 km of tunnel works, two caverns, 17 km of transmission lines as part of the construction, and is 90% underground. Alto Maipo has
three main contractors and covers three adjacent valleys in the Chilean Andes. As of today, the project employs approximately 4,300 people and
expects to reach a peak close to 4,500. The project units are scheduled to reach commercial operation in the first half of 2019.

We are expanding our business by evaluating opportunities in the desalination business line through two initiatives: i) brownfield projects,
which take advantage of existing infrastructure in thermoelectric power plants (marine works, easy access to power, strategic location, permits, etc.),
providing shorter development time lines and more competitive water tariffs to offtakers; and ii) greenfield projects, mainly for mining companies
which either purchase industrial water through water purchase agreements, or either invite external companies to compete in a bidding process to
develop a project under a build-own-operate-and-transfer scheme where the water facility along its pipeline is transferred to the mining operation at
the end of a defined period. In Chile, most of the water demand comes from mining operations, either directly or indirectly (their service providers),
hence negative outlooks in the mineral markets have translated in the postponement of most of the mining projects and their corresponding water
demands.

Colombia

Business Description — We operate in Colombia through AES Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, who owns a hydroelectric plant with an

installed capacity of 1,000 MW, and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric, both located approximately 160 km east of Bogota. As of
December 31, 2016, AES Chivor's net power production in reached 4,373 GWh. AES Chivor’s installed capacity accounted for approximately 6.1%
of system capacity by the end of the year. Chivor remains dependent on prevailing hydrological conditions in the region in which it operates.
Hydrological conditions largely influence generation and the spot prices at which AES Chivor sells its non-

27

contracted generation in Colombia.

AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to reduce margin volatility by selling a significant portion of the expected generation under short term

contracts, mainly with distribution companies. These contracts are awarded in public auctions and normally last from one to three years. The
remaining generation is sold on the spot market to other generation and trading companies at the system marginal cost, allowing us to maximize the
operating margin. Additionally, AES Chivor receives reliability payments to compensate for the plant availability during periods of power scarcity,
such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages.

Market Structure — Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN which encompasses one-third of Colombia's

territory, providing coverage to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity totaled 16,690 MW as of December 31, 2016,
comprised of 70% hydroelectric generation, 29% thermoelectric generation and 1% other. The dominance of hydroelectric generation and the
marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2016, 72% of total energy demand was
supplied by hydroelectric plants with the remaining supply from thermoelectric generation of 27% and cogeneration and self-generation power of
1%. From 2003 to 2016, electricity demand in the SIN has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 2.9% and the Mining and Energetic Planning
Unit projects an average compound annual growth rate in electricity demand of 3.0% per year for the next 10 years.

Regulatory Framework — Since 1994, the electricity sector in Colombia has operated under a competitive market framework for the generation

and sale of electricity and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by
various laws as well as the regulations and technical standards issued by the CREG. Other government entities that play an important role in the
electricity industry include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility
Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing and inspecting the utility companies; and the Mining and Energetic Planning Unit,
which is in charge of planning the expansion of the generation and transmission network.

The generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term
price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at
freely negotiated prices. Generation companies must submit price bids and report the quantity of energy available on a daily basis. The National
Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost
combination of available generating units.

Regulatory Framework - Tax Regulation — On December 29, 2016, Law 1819 was enacted in Colombia, which introduced a tax reform with

several changes in the Colombian tax system, and became effective on January 1, 2017. This tax reform reduced the statutory corporate tax rate of
companies to 40% in 2017, 37% in 2018, and 33% in 2019 onwards. The law also created a new withholding tax on dividend distributions based on
a tax rate of 5% , applicable on distribution of Colombian profits generated from the taxable year 2017 onwards.

Other Regulatory Considerations — After the phenomenon of El Niño put the energy supply at risk, regulatory agencies and the government

have carried out various studies to make adjustments to the market. The subjects susceptible to revision include the following:

• Adjustments to the scarcity price so that it reflects a true value of thermal plants that operate in periods of crisis.
• A plan to implement an option to assign firm energy obligations without the need for reliability auctions but with obligation of signing energy

contracts with non-regulated demand.

• Possible participation of renewable plants in the market and its effect in the formation of prices and operation of the market.
• The implementation of the standardized contract market, and
• The possibility of entering into the intraday markets and markets of the previous day are still being considered.

Other topics that the regulator could analyze in 2017, but with a secondary priority are: An international interconnection scheme, review of the

AGC market and analysis of other ancillary services, and possible modification of the current regulation for emergency situations.

Key Financial Drivers — Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's generation level. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while
working to maximize revenue, through sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor's results of operations Hedge levels at Chivor provide certainty
and clarity on the underlying financial drivers, hedging the net cash flows of Chivor, up to 90%. In addition to hydrology financial results are likely to
be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

28

• Forced outages may impact earnings
• AES is exposed to fluctuation of the Colombian peso, which pose a risk to earnings; our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk

to earnings remains

• Chivor has exposure to the spot market as hedge levels are lower in the future

Construction and Development — In Colombia, AES Gener completed the construction of the Tunjita project in June 2016 that added 20 MW

of capacity to the Chivor plant.

Argentina

Business Description — As of December 31, 2016, AES Argentina operates 4,105 MW which represents 12% of the country's total installed
capacity. The installed capacity in the SADI includes the TermoAndes plant, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which is connected both to the SADI and
the Chilean SING. AES Argentina has a diversified generation portfolio of ten generation facilities, comprised of 68% thermoelectric and 32%
hydroelectric capacity. All of the thermoelectric capacity has the capability to burn alternative fuels. Approximately 76% of the thermoelectric
capacity can operate with natural gas or diesel oil, and the remaining 24% can operate with natural gas, fuel oil, or coal.

AES Argentina primarily sells its production to the wholesale electric market where prices are largely regulated. In 2016, approximately 94% of

the energy was sold in the wholesale electric market and 6% was sold under contract, as a result of the Energy Plus sales made by TermoAndes.

All of the thermoelectric facilities not affected by the Resolution 95/2013, a regulation passed in March 2013 discussed below, including the

portion of TermoAndes plant committed to Energy Plus Contracts, are able to use natural gas and receive gas supplied through contracts with
Argentine producers. In recent years, gas supply restrictions in Argentina, particularly during the winter season, have affected some of the plants,
such as the TermoAndes plant. The TermoAndes plant commenced operations in 2000, selling exclusively into the Chilean SING. In 2008, following
requirements from the Argentine authorities, TermoAndes connected its two gas turbines to the SADI, while maintaining its steam turbine connected
to the SING. However, since December 2011, TermoAndes has been selling the plant's full capacity in the SADI.

Market Structure — The SADI electricity market is managed by CAMMESA. As of December 31, 2016, the installed capacity of the SADI
totaled 33,901 MW. In 2016, 66% of total energy demand was supplied by thermoelectric plants, 26% by hydroelectric plants and 8% from nuclear,
wind and solar plants.

Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is principally fueled by natural gas. However, since 2004 due to natural gas shortages, in addition to

increasing electricity demand, the use of alternative fuels in thermoelectric generation, such as oil and coal, has increased. Given the importance of
hydroelectric facilities in the SADI, hydrological conditions determining river flow volumes and initial water levels in reservoirs largely influence
hydroelectric and thermoelectric plant dispatch. Rainfall occurs principally in the southern cone winter season (June to August).

Regulatory Framework — The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission and distribution. The

wholesale electric market is made up of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who are
allowed to buy and sell electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the short-term market or to customers in the contract market.
CAMMESA is responsible for dispatch coordination and determination of short-term prices. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge
of regulating public service activities and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, through the Energy Secretariat, regulates
system dispatch and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities.

Since 2001, significant modifications have been made to the electricity regulatory framework. These modifications include the freezing of
tariffs, the cancellation of inflation adjustment mechanisms and the introduction of a complex pricing system in the wholesale electric market, which
have materially affected electricity generators, transporters and distributors, and generated substantial price differences within the market. Since
2004, as a result of energy market reforms and overdue accounts receivables owed by the government to generators operating in Argentina, AES
Argentina contributed certain accounts receivables to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These
receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plants begin operations. At this point, three
funds have been created to construct three facilities. The three plants are operating and payments are being received. AES Argentina will receive a
pro rata ownership interest in these newly built plants once the accounts receivables have been paid. See Item 7.— Capital Resources and Liquidity
—Long-Term Receivables and Note 7 —Financing Receivables for further discussion of receivables in Argentina.

29

In March 2013, the Secretariat of Energy released Resolution 95/2013, which affects the remuneration of generators whose sales prices had
been frozen since 2003. This regulation is applicable to generation companies with certain exceptions. It defined a compensation system based on
compensating for fixed costs, non-fuel variable costs and an additional margin. Resolution 95/2013 converted the Argentine electric market to an
"average cost" compensation scheme.

Thermal units must achieve an availability target, which varies by technology, in order to receive full fixed cost revenues. The Resolution also
established that all fuels, except coal, are to be provided by CAMMESA. Thermoelectric natural gas plants not affected by the Resolution, such as
TermoAndes, are able to purchase gas directly from the producers for Energy Plus sales.

In May 2014, the Argentine government passed Resolution No. 529/214 ("Resolution 529") which retroactively updated the prices of

Resolution 95/2013 to February 1, 2014, changed target availability and added a remuneration for non-periodic maintenance. This remuneration is
aimed to cover the expenses that the generator incurs when performing major maintenances in its units. Since 2014, this resolution has been
updated annually, the most recent of which was issued in March 2016.

On February 2, 2017, the Ministry of Energy issued Resolution 19/2017 establishing changes to the Energia Base price framework. Effective in

February 2017, the framework will maintain the current tolling agreement structure, as fuels will continue to be sourced by CAMMESA. A key
change will be introduced to the tariff structure which will now have prices set in USD and also eliminates all future non-cash retention of margins.

In December 2015, the finance minister lifted foreign currency controls, allowing the peso to float under the administration of Argentinean
Central Bank. The newly freed currency fell by more than 30%. Over the course of 2016, the Argentinean Peso devalued by approximately 22%. At
December 31, 2016, all transactions at our businesses in Argentina were translated using the official exchange rate published by the Argentine
Central Bank. See Note 7— Financing Receivables in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further
information on the long-term receivables. Further weakening of the Argentine Peso and local economic activity could cause significant volatility in
our results of operations, cash flows, the ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company, and the value of our assets.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

•
•
•
•

•

Forced outages may impact earnings
FX exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine Peso
Hydrology

Timely collection of FONINVEMEM installment and outstanding receivables (See Note 7— Financing Receivables in Item 8.— Financial

Business Description — Eletropaulo distributes electricity to the greater São Paulo area, Brazil's main economic and financial center. AES

owns 17% of the economic interest in Eletropaulo, our partner, BNDES, owns 19% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held by
government-related entities. On December 30, 2016 AES purchased par shares from BNDES and increased its participation in Eletropaulo from
16% to 17%. AES is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business. Eletropaulo holds a 30-year concession that expires
in 2028. In December 2016, Eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, prepare for the listing of its
shares on the Novo Mercado, a segment of the Brazilian stock exchange.

Regulatory Framework — In Brazil, ANEEL, a government agency, sets the tariff for each distribution company based on a return on asset

base methodology, which also benchmarks operational costs against other distribution companies. The tariff charged to regulated customers
consists of two elements: (i) pass-through of non-manageable costs under a determined methodology ("Parcel A"), including energy purchase costs,
sector charges and transmission and distribution system expenses; and (ii) a manageable cost component ("Parcel B"), including operation and
maintenance costs (defined by ANEEL), recovery of investments and a component for a return to the distributor. The return to distributors is
calculated as the net asset base multiplied by the regulatory weighted-average cost of capital, which is set for all industry participants during each
tariff reset cycle. The current regulatory weighted-average cost of capital for Eletropaulo, after tax, is 8.1%.

Each year ANEEL reviews each distributor's tariff for an annual tariff adjustment. The annual tariff adjustments allow for pass-through of Parcel

A costs and inflation impacts on Parcel B costs, adjusted for expected efficiency gains and quality performances. Distribution companies are
required to contract between 100% and 105% of anticipated energy needs through the regulated auction market. If contracted levels fall below
required levels distribution companies may be subject to limitations on the pass-through treatment of energy purchase costs as well as penalties. As
the costs incurred on energy purchases made by our distribution company are passed through

31

to customers with adjustments on a yearly basis, working capital can be sensitive to significant increases in energy prices. In order to reduce
potential working capital needs, in 2015 ANEEL established the tariff flag mechanism, which allows temporary tariff changes to customers on a
monthly basis depending on energy purchase prices. The resources collected by the tariff flag mechanism are centralized in an account and shared
among distribution companies in proportion to their respective exposure to the spot market.

Every four years, ANEEL resets each distributor's tariff to incorporate the revised regulatory weighted-average cost of capital and

determination of the distributor's net asset base as well as operational costs. Eletropaulo's tariff reset occurs every four years and the next tariff
reset will be in July 2019. The 4 th Tariff Reset for AES Eletropaulo occurred on July 4, 2015, representing an average tariff increase of 15.23%.

Between the tariff reset periods, the regulator applies the annual adjustments. On July 4, 2016 ANEEL approved a negative tariff adjustment

for Eletropaulo, mainly due to a decrease in energy purchase and sector charges costs. The average tariff decrease was 8.1% .

In 2013, ANEEL challenged the parameters of a tariff reset for Eletropaulo implemented in July 2012 and retroactive to 2011. ANEEL asserted

that during the period between 2007 and 2011, certain assets that were included in the regulatory asset base should not have been included and
that Eletropaulo should refund customers for the return on the disputed assets earned during this period. On December 17, 2013, ANEEL
determined, at the administrative level, that Eletropaulo should adjust the prior 2007-2011 regulatory asset base and refund customers in the
amount of $269 million over a period of up to four tariff processes beginning in July 2014. The Company recognized a regulatory liability of
approximately $269 million in 2013, since ANEEL had compelled the Company to refund customers, and started reimbursing customers in July
2014. Eletropaulo filed for an administrative appeal requesting ANEEL to reconsider its decision and requested that the decision be suspended until
the appeal process is completed. The injunction was granted and, although for a period was suspended, it has been restored and in effect since
December 2014.

Given ANEEL's failure to suspend the injunction through the appeals process in the Brazilian courts thus far, the tariff reset resulted in
management's reassessment of the probability of refunding customers these disputed amounts. Therefore, at this point, the Company considers it
only reasonably possible that Eletropaulo will be required to refund these amounts to customers prior to the ultimate resolution of the pending court
case. As a result, during 2015, the Company reversed the remaining regulatory liability for this contingency of $161 million. Eletropaulo believes it
has meritorious arguments on this matter and will continue to pursue its objections to ANEEL's rulings vigorously, however there can be no
assurance that Eletropaulo will prevail.

Key Financial Drivers — Eletropaulo's financial results is likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy sold and energy purchased
Brazilian economic scenario and tariff increases, impacting energy consumption growth, losses and delinquency

•
•
• Quality indicators recovery plan
•
•
•
•

Ability of Eletropaulo to pass through costs via productivity gains
Ability of Eletropaulo to solve involuntary exposure
Capital structure optimization to reduce leverage and interest costs
The CTEEP Eletrobrás case (see Item 3.— Legal Proceedings for further information)

Eletropaulo is affected by the demand for electricity, which is driven by economic activity, weather patterns and customers' consumption
behavior. Operating performance is also driven by the quality of service, efficient management of operating and maintenance costs as well as the
ability to control non-technical losses. Finally, annual tariff adjustments and periodic tariff resets by ANEEL impact results from operations.

Brazil Generation

Business Description — Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power plants with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW in the state of São
Paulo. Tietê was privatized in 1999 under a 30-year concession expiring in 2029. AES owns a 24% economic interest in Tietê, our partner, the
BNDES, owns 28% and the remaining shares are publicly held or held by government-related entities. AES is the controlling shareholder and
manages and consolidates this business.

Tietê sold nearly 100% of its physical guarantee, approximately 11,194 GWh, to Eletropaulo under a long-term PPA, which expired in

December 2015. The contract was price-adjusted annually for inflation, and as of December

32

31, 2015, the price was R$218/MWh. After the expiration of contract with Eletropaulo, Tietê's strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee,
as described in Regulatory Framework section below, and sell the remaining portion in the spot market. Tietê's strategy is reassessed from time to
time according to changes in market conditions, hydrology and other factors. Tietê has been continuously selling its available energy from 2016
forward through medium-term bilateral contracts of three to five years.

As of December 31, 2016, Tietê's contracted portfolio position is 95% and 88% with average prices of R$157/MWh and R$159/MWh (inflation

adjusted until December 2016) for 2016 and 2017, respectively. As Brazil is mostly a hydro-based country with energy prices highly tied to the
hydrological situation, the deterioration of the hydrology since the beginning of 2014 caused an increase in energy prices going forward. Tietê is
closely monitoring and analyzing system supply conditions to support energy commercialization decisions.

Under the concession agreement, Tietê has an obligation to increase its capacity by 15%. Tietê, as well as other concession generators, have

not yet met this requirement due to regulatory, environmental, hydrological and fuel constraints. The state of São Paulo does not have a sufficient
potential for wind power and only has a small remaining potential for hydro projects. As such, the capacity increases in the state will mostly be
derived from thermal gas capacity projects. Due to the highly complex process to obtain an environmental license for coal projects, Tietê decided to
fulfill its obligation with gas-fired projects in line with the federal government plans. Petrobras refuses to supply natural gas and to offer capacity in its
pipelines and regasification terminals. Therefore, there are no regulations for natural gas swaps in place, and it is unfeasible to bring natural gas to
AES Tietê. A legal case has been initiated by the state of São Paulo requiring the investment to be performed. Tietê is in the process of analyzing
options to meet the obligation.

Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the state of Rio Grande do Sul,
commissioned in December 2000. AES manages and has a 46% economic interest in the plant with the remaining interest held by BNDES. The
plant's operations were suspended in April 2009 due to the unavailability of gas. AES has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a
competitive basis to Uruguaiana. One of the challenges is the capacity restrictions on the Argentinean pipeline, especially during the winter season
when gas demand in Argentina is very high. The plant operated on a short-term basis during February and March 2013, March through May 2014,
and February through May 2015 due to the short-term supply of LNG for the facility. The plant did not operate in 2016. Uruguaiana continues to
work toward securing gas on a long-term basis.

Market Structure — Brazil has installed capacity of 150,136 MW, which is 65% hydroelectric, 19% thermal and 16% renewable (biomass and

wind). Brazil's national grid is divided into four subsystems. Tietê is in the Southeast and Uruguaiana is in the South subsystems of the national grid.

Regulatory Framework — In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy that a plant can sell, called
physical guarantee, which represents the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee can
be sold to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy
trading companies.

The National System Operator ("ONS") is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operation of the national grid. The ONS dispatches

generators based on hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand and the prices of fuel and thermal generation. Given the
importance of hydro generation in the country, the ONS sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to
protect reservoir levels in the system.

In Brazil, the system operator controls all hydroelectric generation dispatch and reservoir levels. A mechanism known as the Energy
Reallocation Mechanism ("MRE") was created to share hydrological risk across MRE hydro generators. If the hydro plants generate less than the
total MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market to fulfill their contract obligations. When
total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE physical guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they are able
to make extra revenue selling the excess energy on the spot market. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) thermal plants more
expensive to the system being dispatched, (ii) lower hydropower generation with deficits in the MRE and (iii) high spot prices. ANEEL defines the
spot price cap for electricity in the Brazilian market. The spot price caps as defined by ANEEL and average spot prices by calendar year are as
follows (R$/MWh):

Key Financial Drivers — As the system is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, Tietê and Uruguaiana are are affected by the
hydrology in the overall sector. They are also affected by the availability of Tietê's plants and reliability of the Uruguaiana facility. The availability of
gas is also a driver for continued operations at Uruguaiana. Tietê's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited
to:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in MRE
Demand growth
Re-contracting price
Asset management and plant availability
Cost management
Ability to execute on its growth strategy

MCAC Utilities

El Salvador

Business Description — AES is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador. The distribution
companies are operated by AES on an integrated basis under a single management team. AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the country.
AES El Salvador accounted for 4,151 GWh of market energy purchases during 2016, or about 63% market share of the country's total energy
purchases.

MCAC Generation

Dominican Republic

Business Description — AES Dominicana consists of three operating subsidiaries, Itabo, Andres and DPP. AES has 24% of the system
capacity of 850 MW and supplies approximately 37% of energy demand through these generation facilities. AES has a strategic partnership with the
Estrella and Linda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), an investor group based in the Dominican Republic. Estrella-Linda is a consortium of two leading
Dominican industrial groups: Estrella and Grupo Linda. The two partners manage a diversified business portfolio, including construction services,
cement, agribusiness, metalwork, plastics, textiles, paints, transportation, insurance and media.

Itabo is 45% owned by AES, 5% by Estrella-Linda, 49.97% owned by FONPER, a government-owned utility and the remaining 0.03% is owned

by employees. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power generation units with a total of 295 MW of installed capacity. Itabo's PPAs with
government-owned distribution companies expired in July 2016 and thus two new short term contracts with Ede Sur and Ede Este were signed until
new long term contracts take place. The Dominican Corporation of State Electrical Companies is sponsoring a bidding process, released in

35

August 2016, which is expected to be awarded in April 2017 in order to secure supply and competitive pricing for actual and future distribution
energy requirements. The existing business strategy is to secure between 80% and 85% of the open position through new PPAs with distribution
companies and large users. Price and PPA structure will be subject to the terms of the bidding process.

Andres and DPP are owned 90% by AES and 10% by Estrella-Linda. Andres has a combined cycle gas turbine and generation capacity of 319
MW as well as the only LNG import facility in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. DPP (Los Mina) has two open cycle natural
gas turbines and generation capacity of 236 MW. Both Andres and DPP have in aggregate 555 MW of installed capacity, of which 450 MW is mostly
contracted until 2018 with government-owned distribution companies and large customers.

AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. The
LNG contract terms allow the diversion of the cargoes to various markets in Latin America. These plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG
contract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel oil-based generation. Andres has a long-term contract to sell re-gasified LNG to
industrial users within the Dominican Republic using compression technology to transport it within the country thereby capturing demand from
industrial and commercial customers.

Market Structure - Electricity and Natural Gas — The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with approximately 3,553 MW

of installed capacity, composed primarily of thermal generation (80%), hydroelectric power plants (17%) and wind plants (3%).

Regulatory Framework — The regulatory framework in the Dominican Republic consists of a decentralized industry including generation,

transmission and distribution, where generation companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services and a
competitive wholesale generation market. All electric companies (generators, transmission and distributors), are subject to and regulated by the
General Electricity Law.

Two main agencies are responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the National Energy Commission

and the Superintendence of Electricity. The National Energy Commission is in charge of drafting and coordinating the legal framework and
regulatory legislation, proposing and adopting policies and procedures to assure best practices, drafting plans to ensure the proper functioning and
development of the energy sector and promoting investment. The Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring and
supervising compliance with legal provisions and rules, monitoring compliance with the technical procedures governing generation, transmission,
distribution and commercialization of electricity and supervising electric market behavior in order to avoid monopolistic practices.

The electricity tariff applicable to regulated customers is subject to regulation within the concessions of the distribution companies. Clients with

demand above 1 MW are classified as unregulated customers and their tariffs are unregulated.

Fuels and hydrocarbons are regulated by a specific law which establishes prices to end customers and a tax on consumption of fossil fuels.
For natural gas there are regulations related to the procedures to be followed to grant licenses and concessions: i) distribution, including loading,
transportation and compression plants; ii) the installation and operation of natural gas stations, including consumers and potential modifications of
existing facilities; and iii) conversion equipment suppliers for vehicles. The regulation is administered by the Industrial and Commerce Ministry who
supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to the end users.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

Changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices, (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in oil prices
will impact the spot sales for both Andres and Itabo)

Contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded

Supply shortages in the near term (next two to three years) may provide opportunities for short term upside, but new generation is expected to
come online beginning 2018
Additional sales derived from domestic natural gas demand are expected to continue providing income and growth based on the entry of
future projects and the fees from the infrastructure service.

•

•

•

•

In addition, the financial weakness of the three state-owned distribution companies due to low collection rates and high levels of non-technical

losses has led to delays in payments for the electricity supplied by generators. At times when outstanding receivable balances have accumulated,
AES Dominicana has accepted payment through other means, such as government bonds, in order to reduce the balance. There can be no
guarantee that alternative collection methodologies will always be an avenue available for payment options.

36

Construction and Development — DPP is converting its existing plant from open cycle to combined cycle. The project will recycle DPP's heat
emissions and increase total power output by approximately 114 MW of gross capacity at an estimated cost of $260 million, fully financed with non-
recourse debt. The EPC contract was signed on July 2, 2014, and the additional capacity is expected to become operational in the first half of 2017.
Based on the increased capacity, AES Dominicana executed a PPA for 270 MW for a 6.5 year term beginning in 2017.

Panama

Business Description — AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants and one thermoelectric power plant, Estrella del Mar I, which

commenced operations in March 2015, representing 705 MW and 72 MW of hydro and thermal capacity respectively, for a total of 777 MW
equivalent to 23% of the installed capacity in Panama. The majority of hydro sources in Panama are based on run-of-river technology, with the
exception of the 260 MW Bayano plant.

A portion of the PPAs with distribution companies will expire in December 2018 reducing the total contracted capacity of the company from 496

MW to 430 MW. Another portion contracted through Estrella del Mar I will expire in June 2020, reducing the total contracted capacity to 350 MW
until December 2030.

Market Structure — Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,350 MW, of which 52% is hydroelectric, 8% wind, 2% solar and the remaining

38% thermal generation from diesel, bunker fuel and coal.

The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission, all of which

are governed by Electric Law 6 enacted in 1997.

Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply

contracts with each other. Outside of the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market.

The National Dispatch Center implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center's
objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system, taking into account the
price of water, which determines the dispatch of hydro plants with reservoirs. Short-term power prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last
dispatched generating unit.

In Panama, dry hydrological conditions remained until June 2016, due to the presence of the El Niño phenomenon, affecting the generation

output from hydroelectric facilities compared to the prior year. AES Panama had to purchase energy on the spot market to fulfill its contract
obligations as its generation output was below contract levels. The drop in the commodities prices helped to reduce the replacement cost and the
financial impact of spot purchases compared to the prior year. Despite the hydrology conditions, spot prices were down to $60/MWh from $91/MWh
in 2015, limiting the amount recognized through the 2014-2016 Government Compensation Agreement to $1 million out of the possible $30 million
for 2016. On March 31, 2014, the government of Panama agreed to reduce the financial impact of spot electricity purchases and transmission
constraints equivalent to a 70 MW reduction in contracted capacity for the period 2014-2016 by compensating AES Panama for spot purchases
above the contracted price of $82.45/MWh, up to $40 million in 2014, $30 million in 2015 and $30 million in 2016.

Regulatory Framework — The SNE has the responsibilities of planning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within
Panama. With these responsibilities, the SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that promote the procurement of electrical
energy, hydrocarbons and alternative energy for the country.

The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control and
oversight of public services including electricity and the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities and the companies that provide such
services.

Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity. Physical generation of energy is determined by the National Dispatch Center regardless

of contractual arrangements.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

•

•

In the event of low hydrology, high commodity prices will increase the business exposure and the cost of replacement power to fulfill our
contractual commitments, partially mitigated by additional generation from Estrella del Mar I.
Fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil prices, affect the thermal generation cost impacting the spot prices and the opportunity cost of
water.

37

•

•

Constraints imposed by the capacity of the transmission line connecting the west side of the country with the load center are expected to
continue until the end of 2017 keeping surplus power trapped, particularly during the wet season.
Country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.

Given that most of AES' portfolio is run-of-river, hydrological conditions have an important influence on its profitability. Variations in actual

hydrology can result in excess or a short energy balance relative to our contract obligations. During the low inflow period of January through May,
generation tends to be lower and AES Panama may purchase energy in the short-term market to cover contractual obligations. During the
remainder of the year (June to December), generation tends to be higher and energy generated in excess of contract volumes is sold to the short-
term market. In addition to hydrological conditions, commodity prices affect short-term electricity prices.

Construction and Development — Continuing with the strategy to reduce reliance on hydrology started with the acquisition of the power barge,

Estrella del Mar I, in August 2015 AES executed a partnership agreement with Deeplight Corporation, a minority partner, with the purpose to
construct, operate and maintain a natural gas power generation plant and a liquefied natural gas terminal, in order to purchase and sell energy and
capacity as well as commercialize natural gas and other ancillary activities related to natural gas. As of December 31, 2016, amounts capitalized
include $254 million recorded in Construction in Progress and the project is scheduled to initiate operations in the first half of 2018.

Mexico

Business Description — AES has 1,055 MW of installed capacity in Mexico, including the 550 MW Termoeléctrica del Golfo ("TEG") and

Termoeléctrica Peñoles ("TEP") facilities and Merida III ("Merida"), a 505 MW generation facility.

The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired plants, located in San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 with

a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract.

Merida is a CCGT, located in Merida, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the Federal Commission of Electricity ("CFE")
under a capacity and energy based long-term PPA through 2025. Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel fuel under a long-term
contract, the cost of which is then passed through to CFE under the terms of the PPA.

In line with AES' strategy of building strategic partnerships, on January 18, 2016 the 50/50 joint venture partnership agreement with Grupo BAL

was fully executed. The joint venture will co-invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico.

Market Structure — Mexico has a single national electricity grid, the National Power System, covering nearly all of Mexico's territory. Mexico

has an installed capacity totaling 68 GW with a generation mix of 72% thermal, 18% hydroelectric and 10% other. Electricity consumption is split
between the following end users: industrial of 58%, residential of 26% and commercial and service of 16%.

Regulatory Framework — Following the constitutional changes approved in December 2013, during 2014 and 2015 the Mexican government
issued a package of secondary regulations, including the Electricity Law, and operational dispositions, with the objective to start the implementation
of a new regulatory framework with the following characteristics:

• The energy market liberalization in January 2016 through the implementation of: wholesale electricity market (day ahead and real time market),

ancillary services, capacity, Clean Energy Certificates, and Financial Transmission Rights market.

• CFE's, former state-owned electric monopoly, vertical and horizontal disintegration into different segments of the value chain: generation,

transmission, distribution and commercialization.

• CENACE as new ISO is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning the

network developments, guaranteeing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and
setting transmission charges.
Implementation of annual mid and long term auctions to secure supply for the regulated demand, establishing a PPA with CFE as the Basic
Supplier.

•

According to the new regulatory framework, new assets developed under the new framework or assets transferred to the new regime and in
operation after the approval of the Electricity Law (August 2014) are eligible to participate in the new markets. Additionally, projects developed and
operated under the Electric Public Service Law

38

(self-supply framework) like TEG/TEP, could choose to participate. Until the new framework is further analyzed, AES will continue operating under
the same conditions. Merida III and TEG/TEP will continue providing power under long-term contracts and selling any excess or surplus energy
produced to CFE.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

• Operational performance (as the companies are fully contracted and better performance provides additional financial benefits including

performance incentives and/or excess energy sales (in the case of TEG/TEP).

• The energy prices of TEG/TEP for the sales in excess over its long-term contracts are driven by the average production cost of CFE which is

•

highly dependent on natural gas and oil.
If the average production cost of CFE is higher than the cost of generating with pet coke, our businesses in Mexico will benefit provided that they
are able to sell energy in excess of their PPAs.

Puerto Rico

Business Description — AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired cogeneration plant and a solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW,
respectively, representing approximately 9% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants have long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 and 2032,
respectively, with PREPA, a state-owned entity that supplies virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits and
distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. See Item 7.— Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico for further
discussion of the long-term PPA with PREPA.

El Salvador

Business Description — AES El Salvador also owns AES Nejapa, a 6 MW power plant generating electricity with methane gas from a landfill,
fully contracted with CAESS. During 2015, AES El Salvador began operations of a AES Moncagua, a 2.5 MW solar facility located in the East of the
country, which is fully contracted with EEO.

The sector is governed by the General Electricity Law and the general and specific orders are issued by Superintendencia General de

Electricidad y Telecomunicacions ("SIGET"). SIGET, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, completed the tariff reset process in
December 2012 and defined the tariff calculation to be applicable for the five year period 2013-2017.

Europe Businesses

Bulgaria

Business Description — Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel plant that was commissioned in June 2011. Maritza is fully compliant with
the European Union Industrial Emission Directive, which became effective in January 2016. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK
under a 15-year PPA, capacity and energy based, with a fuel pass-though, expiring in 2026. The lignite and limestone are supplied under 15-year
fuel supply contracts.

AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March

2010. Its entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in March 2025.

Market Structure — The maximum market capacity in 2016 was approximately 13 GW. Thermal generation, which is mostly coal-fired, and

nuclear power plants account for 61% of the installed capacity.

Regulatory Framework — The electricity sector in Bulgaria operates under the Energy Act of 2004 which allows the sale of electricity to take

place freely at negotiated prices, at regulated prices between parties or on the organized market. In 2016 the government of Bulgaria made
advances toward market liberalization and has engaged with the World Bank to develop a model for a fully liberalized electricity market in Bulgaria.
The final report with recommendations from the World Bank was finalized in December 2016. The Independent Bulgarian Energy Exchange (IBEX)
started commercial operation of the power exchange in January 2016 with the introduction of Day Ahead market platform. In September 2016, IBEX
expanded its trading platform for bilateral forward contracts. The next step of the development of IBEX is the introduction of intra-day trading, which
is expected in mid-2017.

Our investments in Bulgaria rely on long-term PPAs with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. NEK

had been facing some liquidity issues and had been delayed in making payments under the PPAs with Maritza and St. Nikola. In August 2015, the
ninth amendment of Maritza's PPA was executed, under which Maritza and NEK agreed to reduce the capacity payment to Maritza by 14% through
the PPA term without impacting the energy price component. In exchange, NEK paid Maritza its overdue receivables. The amendment became
effective in April 2016 upon full payment of the overdue receivables by NEK. Maritza has experienced timely collection of outstanding receivables
from NEK since May 2016.

The Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission (“DG Comp”) continues to review NEK’s respective PPAs with Maritza

and an unrelated generator pursuant to the European Commission’s state aid rules. Although no formal investigation has been launched by DG
Comp, Maritza has met with the DG Comp case team and representatives of Bulgaria to discuss the agency’s review. Maritza expects that the
parties will engage in

40

further discussions on the issues surrounding the review. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of such discussions, nor can we predict how
DG Comp might resolve its review if the anticipated discussions fail to result in an agreement concerning the review. Maritza believes that its PPA is
legal and in compliance with all applicable laws, and it will take all actions necessary to protect its interests, whether through negotiated agreement
or otherwise. However, there can be no assurances that this matter will be resolved favorably; if it is not, there could be a material adverse impact
on Maritza’s and the Company’s respective financial statements.

In 2015, a number of measures were introduced to the regulation of the energy sector that significantly improved the liquidity of NEK. As a
result, NEK is forecast to end the year 2016 with a $7 million net profit, more than a $102 million improvement over year 2015 and more than a $316
million improvement over year 2014 . However, the financial situation of NEK remains subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in
Bulgaria.

Key Financial Drivers — Both businesses, Maritza and St. Nikola, operate under PPA contracts. For the duration of the PPA, the financial

results are primarily driven by, but not limited to:

•
•
•

the availability of the operating units
the level of wind resource for St. Nikola
NEK's ability to meet the terms of the PPA contract

United Kingdom

Business Description — AES' generation businesses in the United Kingdom are located in Northern Ireland and operate in the Irish SEM

(1,726 MW). The Northern Ireland generation facilities consist of two plants within the Greater Belfast region. Our Kilroot plant is a 701 MW coal-
fired plant with an additional 10 MW of energy storage facility and our Ballylumford plant is a 1,015 MW gas-fired plant. These plants provide
approximately 62% of the Northern Ireland installed capacity and 16% of the combined installed capacity for the island of Ireland.

Kilroot is a merchant plant that bids into the SEM. the plant earns margin when scheduled in merit, out of merit, for capacity payments, and for

ancillary services. Out of merit dispatch, through which costs are recovered, occurs when there are system constraints related to wind generation,
voltage and transmission.

Ballylumford is partially contracted for 600 MW under a PPA with PPB that expires in 2023 with the remaining capacity bid into the SEM
market. 310 MW of this merchant capacity has a supplemental Local Reserve Services Agreement ("LRSA") with the system operator. Ballylumford
earns margin from availability payments received under the PPA, capacity payments offered through the SEM and revenues from the LRSA.
Additionally, Ballylumford receives margin from out of merit dispatch through which the costs of operation are recovered as well as ancillary
services.

Market Structure — The majority of the generation capacity in the SEM is represented by gas-fired power plants, which results in market

sensitivity to gas prices. Wind generation capacity represents approximately 25% of the total generation capacity. The governments of Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland plan further increases in renewable energy sources. Market availability and liquidity of hedging products are
weak, reflecting the limited size and immaturity of the market, the predominance of vertical integration and lack of forward pricing. There are
essentially three products (baseload, mid-merit and peaking) which are traded between the generators and suppliers.

Regulatory Framework — The SEM is an energy market established in 2007 and is based on a gross mandatory pool within which all
generators with a capacity higher than 10 MW must trade the physical delivery of power. Generators are centrally dispatched based on merit order
and physical constraints of the system. The SEM structure is under review by the regulatory authorities with a new structure due to be introduced in
the second quarter of 2018.

In addition, there is a capacity payment mechanism to ensure that sufficient generating capacity is offered to the market. The capacity payment

is derived from a regulated Euro-based capacity payment pool, established a year ahead by the regulatory authority. Capacity payments are based
on the declared availability of a unit and have a degree of volatility to reflect seasonal influences, demand and the actual out-turn of generation
declared available over each trading period.

Environmental Regulation — In 2011, the European Commission adopted the Industrial Emission Directive ("IED") that establishes the
Emission Limit Values ("ELV") for SO 2 , NO x and dust emissions effective January 1, 2016. Both Ballylumford and Kilroot are required to comply
with the IED. The Ballylumford C Station is compliant without the need for investment. Both Ballylumford B Station and Kilroot required investment to
be in compliance.

41

The IED provides for two options that may be implemented by the European Union member states other than compliance with the new ELV's

the Transitional National Plan or Limited Life Time Derogation.

Kilroot has opted into the Transitional National Plan which allows the plant to operate between 2016-2020, being exempt from compliance with

ELVs, but observing a ceiling set for maximum annual emissions that is based on the last 10 years average emissions and operating hours. Kilroot
has invested approximately $10 million in Umbrella Selective Non Catalytic Reduction technology, which reduces the plant's NO x emissions
enabling the plant to increase its capacity factor within the ceiling of NO x emissions and earn energy margin. The Transitional National Plan also
established a UK wide NO x trading scheme which Kilroot avails of as required. Further technical modifications are being evaluated which could
make the plant fully compliant with the IED from 2020.

Without investment, the Ballylumford B station of 540 MW did not meet the standards of the IED. In 2014, AES secured a LRSA with the
Transmission System Operator ("TSO") to refurbish two of the three units to be compliant with ELVs under IED, providing at least 250 MW of
capacity from 2016 to 2018 with an option to extend to 2020 by the TSO. The project was executed in 2015 with an achieved combined gross output
of 310 MW.

Key Financial Drivers — For our businesses in the SEM market, the financial results will be driven by, but not limited to, the following:

•
•
•
•

Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanism
Availability of the operating units
Commodity prices (gas, coal and CO 2 ) and sufficient market liquidity to hedge prices in the short-term
Electricity demand in the SEM (including impact of wind generation)

Kazakhstan

Business Description — Our businesses account for approximately 6% of the total annual generation in Kazakhstan. Of the total capacity of

2,776 MW, 1,033 MW is hydroelectric and operates under a concession agreement until the beginning of October 2017 and 1,743 MW is coal-fired
capacity which is owned outright. The thermal plants are designed to produce heat with electricity as a co- or by-product.

The Kazakhstan businesses act as merchant plants for electricity sales by entering into bilateral contracts directly with consumers for periods
of generally no more than one year. There are limited opportunities for the plants to be in contracted status, as there is no central offtaker, and the
few businesses that could take a whole plant's generation tend to have in-house generation capacity.

The hydroelectric plants are run-of-river and rely on river flow and precipitation, particularly snow. Due to the presence of a large multi-year

storage dam upstream and a season minimum river flow rate agreement with Russia downstream, the plants are protected against significant
downside risk to their volume in years with low precipitation. AES does not control water flow which impacts our generation.

Ust Kamenogorsk CHP provides heat to the city of Ust Kamenogorsk through the city heat network company (Ust Kamenogorsk Heat Nets).

Ust Kamenogorsk CHP is their only source of supply.

Market Structure — The Kazakhstan electricity market totals approximately 21,307 MW, of which 17,504 MW is available. The bulk of the
generating capacity in Kazakhstan is thermal with coal as the main fuel. As coal is abundantly available in Kazakhstan, most plants are designed to
burn local coal. The geographical remoteness of Kazakhstan, in combination with its abundant resources, results in coal prices that are not reflective
of world coal prices, current delivered cost is less than $12 per metric ton. In addition, the government closely monitors coal prices, due to their
impact on the price of socially necessary heating and on electricity tariffs.

Regulatory Framework — All Kazakhstan generating companies sell electricity at or below their respective tariff-cap level. These tariff-cap
levels have been fixed by the Kazakhstan government for the period 2009-2018 for each of the fifteen groups of generators. These groups were
determined by the Ministry of Energy, based on a number of factors including plant type and fuel used.

In July 2012, Kazakhstan enacted an amendment to its Electricity Law requiring electricity producers to reinvest all profits generated during the

years 2013-2015 as part of annual investment obligation agreements, thereby limiting the businesses ability to distribute dividends. These
investment obligation agreements had to be equal to the sum of the planned annual depreciation and profit. Selection of investment projects was at
the discretion of electricity producers, but the Ministry of Energy had the right to reject submitted proposals. An electricity producer without an
investment obligation agreement executed by the Ministry of Energy was not allowed to charge tariffs exceeding its incremental cost of production,
excluding depreciation.

42

In November 2015, Kazakhstan enacted amendments to its Electricity Law to eliminate the obligation for power plants to sign annual

investment obligation agreements for 2016-2018, thereby allowing the businesses to distribute dividends. In addition, the amendment stated that a
centrally organized capacity market will be established by 2019 and that the Kazakhstan government plans to prolong price cap regulation by fixing
new caps on energy and capacity tariffs for each group of power plants.

Kazakhstan government has approved a renewable energy law which set feed-in tariffs for renewable energy and set a renewable energy
target of 3% by 2020 and 10% by 2030. This renewable energy law imposes an obligation on all non-renewable power plants to purchase renewable
energy at the renewable energy tariff and resell it to customers at their own, lower price cap level.

Heat production in Kazakhstan is also regulated as a natural monopoly. The heat tariffs are set on a cost-plus basis by making an application to

the Committee of Natural Monopoly Regulation and Competition Protection, the regulator. Currently, tariffs are only for multi-year periods, but with
some annual adjustments for fuel cost.

Key Financial Drivers — The financial results for assets in Kazakhstan are driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

Availability of the operating units;
Regulated electricity tariff-cap levels and heat tariff levels

•
•
• Weather conditions,
•
•

Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanism
Cost of coal and Kazakhstan currency exchange rate fluctuation.

India

Business Description — OPGC is a 420 MW coal-fired generation facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC has a 30-year PPA with

GRIDCO Limited, a state utility, expiring in 2026. The PPA is composed of a capacity payment based on fixed parameters and a variable
component, including a pass-through of actual fuel costs. OPGC is an unconsolidated entity and results are reported as Net Equity in Earnings of
Affiliates in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Environmental Regulation — The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India has recently amended the Environment
(Protection) Rules with stricter emission limits for new and existing thermal power plants via their notification issued in December 2015. All existing
plants installed before December 31, 2003 are required to meet revised emission limits within two years and any new thermal power plants that will
be operational from January 1, 2017 are required to operate with the revised emission limits. An FGD system needs to be installed in the existing
units of OPGC for complying with SO 2 emissions requirements. The business has evaluated the options and the cost implications for the operating
plant including design modification and schedule implications for the expansion project. The larger impact of these amendments and requirements of
substantial investments to meet the revised environmental guidelines across the power sector in India, borne by the public and private power
generation companies, is still under review. We believe the cost of complying with the new environmental regulations will be a pass-through in the
GRIDCO tariff for both existing and expansion units. Ministry of Power has issued a revised Tariff Policy in January 2016 to bring more regulatory
certainty, attract private investment, ensure distribution efficiency and promote renewable energy.

Construction and Development — As noted above, AES has one coal-fired project under development with a total capacity of 1,320 MW which

is an expansion of our existing OPGC business. The project started construction in April 2014 and is currently expected to begin operations in the
second half of 2018. As of December 31, 2016 , total capitalized costs at the project level were $598 million (the Company's share is $293 million as
part of our investment in subsidiary). In addition, AES has capitalized $18 million in construction management costs which are not attributable to the
partner. Currently, 50% of the expansion capacity is contracted with the state offtaker, GRIDCO, for a period of 25 years, with a normative after-tax
rate of return of 15.5% with an opportunity to capture additional 0.5% tied to timely completion of the project. The rest of the 50% of the generation
capacity is proposed to be offered to GRIDCO under a fresh regulated PPA due to restrictions on power sale under new guidelines.

In August 2014, the Supreme Court of India invalidated the allocation of captive coal blocks. The government of India has subsequently
enacted new laws allowing coal block allocation to companies with limited levels of private ownership, based on which the coal blocks have been
allocated to a subsidiary of OPGC, Odisha Coal and Power Ltd., which is an OPGC joint venture with another company wholly-owned by the
government of Odisha. This new company meets the lower private ownership stipulations for allocation of mines.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

• Operating performance of the facility

•

Regulatory and environmental policy changes

Philippines

Business Description — The Masinloc power project in the Philippines is a 630 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Zambales, Philippines and
is interconnected to the Luzon Grid, and is owned 51% by AES. More than 95% of Masinloc's current peak capacity is contracted through medium to
long-term bilateral contracts primarily with Meralco, the largest distribution company in the Philippines, several electric cooperatives and industrial
customers.

In January 2013, Masinloc entered into a new PSA with its main customer, Meralco, as the previous PSA expired in December 2012. The PSA

is for seven years and included an additional three-year extension option, which the parties agreed to exercise in March 2016. Payments are
primarily capacity-based. The PSA is primarily priced in U.S. dollars, aligning the revenues with the majority of variable and fixed costs (fuel, debt,
insurance) and minimizing currency exchange risks. Masinloc's remaining contracts on the existing units expire between 2017 and 2026.

Market Structure — The Philippine power market is divided into three grids representing the country's three major island groups — Luzon,

Visayas and Mindanao. Luzon, which includes Manila and is the country's largest island, has limited interconnection with Visayas and represents
85% of the total demand of both regions. Luzon and Visayas together have an installed capacity of 17,294 MW.

There is diversity in the mix of the Luzon — Visayas generation. For Luzon, coal accounts for 49% of generation, followed by natural gas at
32%, and the remaining 19% is comprised by oil, geothermal, and renewable resources (i.e. hydro, solar, and wind, with the latter two having priority
dispatch with feed-in tariff). For Visayas, geothermal is the top energy source and accounts for 47% of generation followed by coal at 39%, and the
remaining 14% comprised by oil, geothermal, and renewable resources.

The primary customers for electricity are private distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and large contestable (industrial and commercial)

customers. Over 90% of the system's total energy requirement is currently being sold/purchased through medium (three to five years) to long (six to
ten years) term bilateral contracts. The remaining energy is sold through the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market ("WESM"), which is the real-time,
bid-based and hourly market for energy where the sellers and the buyers adjust their differences between their production/demand and their
contractual commitments.

Regulatory Framework — The Philippines has divided its power sector into generation, transmission, distribution and supply under the Electric
Power Industry Reform Act of 2001. This Act primarily aims to increase private sector participation in the power sector and to privatize the Philippine
government's generation and transmission assets. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are
regulated sectors. Sale of power is conducted primarily through medium or long-term bilateral contracts between generation companies and
distribution utilities specifying the volume, price and conditions for the sale of energy and capacity, which are approved by the ERC. Power is traded
in the WESM which operates under a gross pool, central dispatch and net settlement protocols. Parties to bilateral contracts settle their transactions
outside of the WESM and distribution companies or electricity cooperatives buy their imbalance (i.e., power requirements not covered by bilateral
contracts) from the WESM. Distribution utilities and electric cooperatives are allowed to pass on to their end-users the bilateral contract rates,
including WESM purchases, approved by the ERC.

Other Regulatory Considerations — Pursuant to Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, Retail Competition & Open Access ("RCOA")

commenced on June 26, 2013, under which retail electricity suppliers, who are duly licensed by the ERC, may supply directly to contestable
customers (end-users with an average demand of at least 1 MW), with distribution companies or electricity cooperatives providing non-
discriminatory wire services. In order to ensure implementation of RCOA and stimulate transition of contestable customers, ERC issued rules
implementing mandatory contestability. Under the said rules, all contestable customers are mandated to enter into power supply contracts with retail
electricity suppliers by February 2017 instead of purchasing power from their local distribution utility.

Masinloc has obtained a retail electricity supplier license from the ERC and currently markets power to contestable customers. Unlike

Masinloc’s contracts with distribution utilities, its contract with contestable customers do not require ERC approval to be implemented.

Environmental Regulation — To promote renewable energy, the Philippine government enacted the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which

provides incentives for the development, utilization and commercialization of

45

renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, small hydroelectric and biomass energies. In addition, the government also adopted a feed-in tariff
scheme which was detailed under ERC Res No.16 s. 2010, where an eligible producer of renewable energy is entitled to a guaranteed payment of a
fixed rate feed-in tariff for each kilowatt-hour of energy it supplies to the grid. The feed-in tariff to be approved shall be specific for each emerging
renewable energy technology and shall be extended on a first-to-build basis as there is an established cap per technology on eligibility under the
feed-in tariff scheme.

Other Environmental Regulation — Over the past year, the government of the Philippines has sought to reduce its environmental impact,

including the country’s carbon footprint. As such, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources is promoting stricter environmental
compliance, particularly on the effluent discharge standards. The new effluent standards issued in May 2016 have restricted discharge temperature
limit compared to previous standards. It is yet uncertain if the new standards will be applicable to the projects under construction which received
environmental clearance before the new standards were issued.

Construction and Development — AES started construction on a 335 MW gross Masinloc expansion project in March 2016. The total

capitalized cost at December 31, 2016 is $133 million. An engineering, procurement and construction contract was entered into with POSCO
Engineering and Construction of Korea and their wholly owned Philippine affiliate company, Ventanas Philippine Construction Incorporated, in
December 2015, with full notice to proceed issued on March 2016. The project is expected to be commercially operating in 2019. Progress is
advancing as planned and the project is expected to be completed on schedule and within budget. The additional capacity is targeted for sale to
distribution utilities, electric cooperatives, and industrial and commercial customers in the Luzon and Visayas grids. Approximately 50% of this
additional capacity has already been contracted with an expectation to have additional capacity contracted by the date of commercial operations.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to:

• Operating performance of the facility

•

Demand from contracted customers

• Whole sale electricity price in the market

Vietnam

Business Description — The Mong Duong II power project is a 1,242 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam and

was constructed under a BOT contract (the project will be transferred to Vietnamese government after 25 years). AES-VCM Mong Duong Power
Company Limited ("the BOT Company") is a limited liability joint venture owned by affiliates of AES (51%), Posco Energy Corporation (30%) and
China Investment Corporation (19%). This is the first and largest coal-fired BOT project using pulverized coal fired boiler technology in Vietnam. The
BOT Company has entered a PPA with EVN, the national utility, and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin, a state owned entity, both with a 25
year term starting from Commercial Operation Date.

Since April 22, 2015, both units of the power facility have been in commercial operations, six months earlier than the committed schedule with

the Vietnamese government. The BOT Company makes available the dependable capacity and delivers electrical energy to EVN and, in return,
EVN makes payments to the BOT Company.

Market Structure — The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central and South), with total installed capacity of

approximately 41GW, an 8% increase from 2015 (38GW). The total demand in 2016 was 159.5 billion kWh with the highest demand of 76.7 billion
kWh in the South and 66.5 billion kWh in the North.

The fuel mix in Vietnam is comprised of hydropower 35% (priority dispatch with low tariff), coal 36%, gas 19%, diesel and small hydro
generation 4%, oil 2% (dispatched during emergencies or during peak demand), thermo-gas 1% and the remaining 3% imported from China and
Lao. The government has a plan to increase thermal power capacity, primarily with coal, to reduce the dependence on hydroelectricity. According to
the Master Plan VII revised in March 2016, the total targeted installed capacity for 2020 is approximately 60,000 MW, in which coal-fired power will
account for 43%, hydropower and pumped storage hydropower 30%, gas-fired thermo-power 15%, renewable energy 10%, and imported power 2%.

EVN owns 57% of installed generation capacity followed by Petro Vietnam 11%, Vinacomin 4%, BOT projects 11% and others 17%. EVN is a

state-owned company that is solely in charge of buying and selling electricity all over Vietnam. The government is planning to decrease EVN's
ownership and increase private sector participation in the power market.

46

Regulatory Framework — The electricity sector is overseen by several key government entities, including the National Assembly, the Prime

Minister, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Electricity Regulatory Agency of Vietnam, which is under the supervision of the Ministry of
Industry and Trade. These entities are responsible for the issuance of laws, guidance, and implementing regulations for the sector. The Ministry of
Industry and Trade, in particular, is responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, develop the electricity market and
promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is owned by the government through Vinacomin and Petro Vietnam. The government
plans to equitize EVN-owned generation companies and separate generation, System and Market Provider and distribution into three different
independent operations in order to establish the competitive power market.

Other Regulatory Considerations — According to Decision 63/2013/QD-TTG dated August 2013, the roadmap of the power market of Vietnam

consists of three phases. The first phase established a competitive electricity market and was finished at the end of 2014. The second phase: (i)
period of 2015-2016 for establishment of a pilot competitive wholesale electricity market; and (ii) period of 2017-2021 for implementation of a
competitive wholesale electricity market. The third phase: (i) period of 2022-2023 for establishment of a pilot competitive retail electricity market; and
(ii) from 2024 onward for implementation of competitive retail electricity market. EVN, a long standing monopoly in the whole chain of generation,
transmission and distribution, is being restructured to allow spin-off of several subsidiaries into either independent state-owned enterprises or joint
stock companies. The BOT power plants will not participate in the power market; alternatively the single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on
their behalf.

Environmental Regulation — Mong Duong II BOT Power Plant complies strictly with environmental requirements involving local regulations

and IFC Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines for thermal power plants.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are likely to be driven by many factors including, but not limited to the operating performance of the

facility.

Financial Data by Country

See the table with our consolidated operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , and property, plant

and equipment as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , by country, in Note 16 — Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.— Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.

Environmental and Land-Use Regulations

The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential

GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of
coal combustion residuals), and certain air emissions, such as SO 2 , NO X , PM, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and
uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our
U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.— Risk Factors
— Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations; Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from
environmental regulatory agencies; and Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern
about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws
and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K
under the applicable SBUs.

Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting,

ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, electric power generation or distribution assets. In
addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other
international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country
standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as CFB boilers and
advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO 2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for
NO x emissions.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have

become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these
environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7 .—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Environmental Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. The Company and its subsidiaries may be required to make significant capital
or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the
Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.

Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental
laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject
to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3. —Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail
with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action.

United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations

In the U.S. the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO 2 , NO X , PM, GHGs, mercury and

other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.

CSAPR — CSAPR addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air
pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The
CSAPR requires significant reductions in SO 2 and NO X emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate.
Once fully implemented, the rule requires SO 2 emission reductions of 73%, and NO X reductions of 54%, from 2005 levels. The CSAPR is
implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions
allowances created by the EPA. The CSAPR contemplates limited interstate and unlimited intra-state trading of emissions allowances by covered
sources. Initially, the EPA issued

48

emissions allowances to affected power plants based on state emissions budgets established by the EPA under the CSAPR. The Company is
required to comply with the CSAPR in several states, including Ohio, Indiana, Oklahoma and Maryland. The Company complies with CSAPR
through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed. While the Company's 2015 CSAPR compliance
costs were immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this
time.

The EPA issued an interim final rule establishing the following deadlines for implementation of the CSAPR:

•

January 1, 2015: Phase 1 (2015 and 2016) began for annual trading programs. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting SO 2
and NO x emissions.

• May 1, 2015: Phase 1 began for ozone-season NO x trading program. Existing units must have begun monitoring and reporting NO x emissions.
• December 1, 2015 (and each Dec. 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with ozone-season NO x trading program

(i.e., allowance transfer deadline).

• March 1, 2016 (and each March 1 thereafter): Date by which sources must demonstrate compliance with annual trading programs (i.e.,

allowance transfer deadline).
January 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for annual trading programs. Assurance provisions in effect.

•
• May 1, 2017: Phase 2 (2017 and beyond) begins for ozone-season NO x trading program. Assurance provisions in effect.

On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS ("CSAPR Update Rule"). The
CSAPR Update Rule finds that NO  x ozone  season emissions  in 22  states  (including  Indiana,  Maryland,  Ohio  and  Oklahoma)  affect  the ability  of
downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated
existing  CSAPR  NO  x ozone  season  emission  budgets  for  electric  generating  units  within  these  states  and  implemented  these  budgets  through
modifications to the CSAPR NO  x ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation  will start in the 2017 ozone season (May-September
2017). Affected facilities will receive fewer ozone season NO x allowances in 2017 and later, resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances.
At  this  time,  we  cannot  predict  what  the  impact  will  be  with  respect  to  these  new  standards  and  requirements,  but  it  could  be  material  if  certain
facilities will need to purchase additional allowances based on reduced allocations.

MATS — Pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA, the EPA published a final rule in 2012 called the MATS establishing National Emissions
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The rule required all affected power plants to
comply with the applicable MATS standards by April 2015, with the possibility of obtaining a one year extension, if needed, to complete the
installation of necessary controls. All of the Company's U.S. coal-fired plants operated by the Company's subsidiaries are currently in compliance
with MATS.

There currently are challenges to the EPA’s determination that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions
from electric generating units - the basis for the MATS rule - proceeding in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the
“D.C. Circuit”) but, in the meantime, the MATS rule remains in effect. We currently cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, or its impact, if any,
on our MATS compliance or ultimate costs.

New Source Review ("NSR") — The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as
electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including
power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements, if they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty,
and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement
strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's coal-fired power plants. The strategy has included both the filing of suits against power
plant owners and the issuance of NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings in this
Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning
NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA.

In 2000, DP&L's Stuart Station received a NOV from the EPA alleging that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scope of the
RMRR exclusion. Hutchings Station also received such a NOV in 2009. Additionally, generation units partially owned by DP&L but operated by other
utilities have received such NOVs

49

relating to equipment repairs or replacements alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to DP&L-operated plants have not been
pursued through litigation by the EPA.

If NSR requirements were imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material
adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the imposition of any such NSR
requirements on IPL, the utility would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce
regulated air emissions, but not fines or penalties; however, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.

Regional Haze Rule — The EPA's "Regional Haze Rule" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and sets

guidelines for determining BART at affected plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" towards eliminating man-made haze by 2064.
The Regional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls,
the cost of the controls and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Class I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similar
areas). The statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although
individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules.

EPA previously determined that states included in the CSAPR would not be required to make source-specific BART determinations for BART-
affected electric generating units, reasoning that the emissions reductions required by the CSAPR were "better than BART." Concurrently, EPA also
finalized a limited disapproval of certain states' plans — including Ohio's — that previously relied on the EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule to improve
visibility and substituted a Federal Implementation Plan that relies on the CSAPR. Environmental groups have challenged EPA's determination than
the CSAPR is "better than BART." The challenge currently is proceeding in the D.C. Circuit.

The second phase of the Regional Haze Rule begins in 2019 and states must submit regional haze plans for this second implementation
period in 2021, to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress towards reducing visibility impairment in Class I areas. States may need to require
additional emissions controls for visibility impairing pollutants, including on BART sources, during the second implementation period. We currently
cannot predict the impact of this second implementation period, if any, on any of our Company’s U.S. subsidiaries.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") — Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants considered harmful to

public health and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, NO x and SO 2 , which result from coal combustion.  Areas meeting the
NAAQS are designated "attainment areas" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered "nonattainment areas." Each state must develop
a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is
required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.

Based on the current and potential future ambient standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have
determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to
modify their State Implementation Plans to detail how the states will regain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the
applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment
status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NO x or SO 2 . The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material.

On September 30, 2015, IDEM published its final rule establishing reduced SO 2 limits for IPL facilities in accordance with a new one-hour

standard of 75 parts per billion, for the areas in which IPL's Harding Street, Petersburg, and Eagle Valley Generating Stations operate. The
compliance date for these requirements was January 1, 2017. No impact is expected for Eagle Valley or Harding Street Generating Stations
because these facilities ceased coal combustion prior to the compliance date. It is expected that improvements to the existing FGDs at Petersburg
will be required in order to comply. IPL estimates costs for compliance at Petersburg at approximately $29 million for measures that enhance the
performance and integrity of the FGDs systems. On May 31, 2016, IPL filed its SO 2 NAAQS compliance plans with the IURC. IPL is seeking
approval for a CPCN for these measures at its Petersburg Generating Station. IPL expects to recover through its environmental rate adjustment
mechanism any operating or capital expenditures related to compliance with these requirements. Recovery of these costs is sought through an
Indiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism, with the remainder recorded as a regulatory
asset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case proceeding. However, there can be no assurances that IPL will be successful in that
regard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of these permit requirements on our consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, or financial condition, but it may be material.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions — In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain

50

stationary sources under the so-called "Tailoring Rule." The regulations are being implemented pursuant to two CAA programs: the Title V Operating
Permit program and the program requiring a permit if undergoing certain new construction or major modifications, known as the PSD. Obligations
relating to Title V permits include record-keeping and monitoring requirements. Sources subject to PSD can be required to implement BACT. In June
2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule by regulating under the PSD
program sources based solely on their GHG emissions. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the EPA could impose GHG BACT
requirements for sources already required to implement PSD for certain other pollutants. Therefore, if future modifications to our U.S.-based
businesses' sources require PSD review for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements. The EPA has issued guidance on what BACT
entails for the control of GHG and has now proposed NSPS for modified and reconstructed units (see below) that will serve as a floor (maximum
emission rate) for future BACT requirements. Individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their
jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate impact of the BACT requirements applicable to us on our operations cannot be determined at this
time as our U.S.-based businesses will not be required to implement BACT until one of them constructs a new major source or makes a major
modification of an existing major source. However, the cost of compliance could be material.

On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units became effective. The NSPS establish CO 2

emissions standards of 1400 lbs/MWh for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of
CO 2 emissions from the plants. The NSPS for large, newly constructed NGCC facilities is 1,000 lbs/MWh. These standards apply to any electric
generating unit with construction commencing after January 8, 2014. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed
electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for future BACT determinations for such units. The NSPS applicable to modified and
reconstructed coal-fired units will be 1,800 lbs CO 2 /MWh for sources with heat input greater than 2,000 MMBtu per hour. For smaller sources,
below 2,000 MMBtu per hour, the standard is 2,000 lbs CO 2 /MWh. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or
modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations.

On December 22, 2015, the EPA's final CO 2 emission rules for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) (called the CPP) also

became effective. The CPP provides for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissions
performance rates that must be achieved starting in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to meet state-wide emission rate standards or
equivalent mass-based standards, with the goal being a 32% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP
requires states to submit, by 2016, implementation plans to meet the standards or a request for an extension to 2018. If a state fails to develop and
submit an approvable implementation plan, the EPA will finalize a federal plan for that state. The full impact of the CPP will depend on the following:

• whether and how the states in which the Company's U.S. businesses operate respond to the CPP;
• whether the states adopt an emissions trading regime and, if so, which trading regime;
• how other states respond to the CPP, which will affect the size and robustness of any emissions trading market; and
• how other companies may respond in the face of increased carbon costs.

Several states and industry groups challenged the NSPS for CO 2 in the D.C. Circuit. Oral argument on the challenges is scheduled for April

2017. We cannot predict at this time the likely outcome of these challenges but, if the NSPS is vacated, it also likely would result in the invalidation
of the CPP, as EPA’s authority to issue the CPP under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act is triggered only be EPA’s promulgation of NSPS under
Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.

In addition, several states and industry groups filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit challenging the CPP and requested a stay of the rule while the
challenge was considered. The D.C. Circuit denied the stay and granted requests to consider the challenges on an expedited basis. As a result, the
D.C. Circuit may issue an opinion on these challenges prior to the end of 2016. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying
implementation of the CPP pending resolution of challenges to the rule. The challenges have been fully briefed and argued before the D.C. Circuit
and could be decided by the court at any time. Challenges to the D.C. Circuit’s decision could then be filed with the Supreme Court.

The Company will likely not know the answers to the above questions regarding the CPP until 2018 or later. As the first compliance period will
not end until 2025, and because we cannot predict whether the CPP will survive the legal challenges, it is too soon to determine the CPP's potential
impact on our business, operations or financial condition, but any such impact could be material.

Cooling Water Intake — The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the
Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by
requiring existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the BTA for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published its
final standards to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at large power plants and other industrial facilities.
These standards require subject facilities that utilize at least 25% of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake
flow of greater than two million gallons per day to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdraw
at least 125 million gallons per day for cooling purposes must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-
specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. This decision-making process would include public input as
part of permit renewal or permit modification. It is possible this process could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle
cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are
required to reduce both impingement and entrainment that achieves one of two alternatives under national BTA standards for entrainment. It is not
yet possible to predict the total impacts of this recent final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such
challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.

AES Southland's current plan to comply with the California State Water Resources Board's ("SWRCB") regulations will see all once-through-

cooled ("OTC") generating units retired from service by December 31, 2020. New air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery
energy storage systems will be constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating stations and the OTC generating units at
the AES Redondo Beach generating station will be retired. The execution of the Implementation Plan for compliance with the SWRCB's OTC policy
is entirely dependent on the Company's ability to execute on long-term power purchase agreements to support project financing of the replacement
generating units at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. The SWRCB is currently reviewing the Implementation Plan and latest update
information to evaluate the impact on electrical system reliability, which could result in the extension of OTC compliance dates for specific units.  The
Company’s California subsidiaries have signed 20-year term power purchase agreements with Southern California Edison for the new generating
capacity which have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Approvals and permits to construct the new generating units are
pending approval by the California Energy Commission and South Coast Air Quality Management District. Construction is scheduled to begin in
June 2017 at AES Huntington Beach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos.

Power plants will be required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements
are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California
assets. Challenges to the federal EPA's rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of
the rule has not been stayed while the challenges proceed. The Company anticipates once-through cooling and CWA Section 316(b) compliance
regulations and costs would have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Water Discharges — Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits

that regulate specific industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the U.S. under the CWA. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S.. This rule, which became effective on
August 28, 2015, may expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to federal permitting. On October 9, 2015,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order to temporarily stay the "Waters of the U.S." rule nationwide while that court
determines whether it has authority to hear the challenges to the rule. The order was in response to challenges brought by 18 states and followed an
August 2015 court decision in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to stay the rule in 13 other states. We cannot predict the duration of the
nationwide or partial stay of the rule or the outcome of this litigation; however, if the rule ultimately survives the legal challenges, it could have a
material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

On January 7, 2013, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issued an NPDES permit for J.M. Stuart Station. The primary issues involve

the temperature and thermal discharges from the Station including the point at which the water quality standards are applied, i.e., whether water
quality standards apply at the point where the Station discharge canal discharges into the Ohio River, or whether, as the EPA alleges, the discharge
canal is an extension of Little Three Mile Creek and the water quality standards apply at the point where water enters the discharge canal. In
addition, there are a number of other water-related permit requirements established with respect to metals and other materials contained in the
discharges from the Station. The NPDES permit establishes interim standards related to the thermal discharge for 54 months that are comparable to
current levels of discharge by

52

Stuart Station. Permanent standards for both temperature and overall thermal discharges are established as of 55 months after the permit is
effective, except that an additional transitional period of approximately 22 months is allowed if compliance with the permanent standards is to be
achieved through a plan of construction and various milestones on the construction schedule are met. It is believed that compliance with the permit
as written will require capital expenses that will be material to DP&L. The cost of compliance and the timing of such costs is uncertain and may vary
considerably depending on a compliance plan that would need to be developed, the type of capital projects that may be necessary, and the
uncertainties that may arise in the likely event that permits and approvals from other governmental entities would likely be required to construct and
operate any such capital project. DP&L has appealed various aspects of the final permit to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission,
although a hearing date is not currently scheduled. The compliance schedule in the final permit has been modified to accommodate the timing of the
hearing. The outcome of such appeal is uncertain.

On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Harding Street and Eagle Valley generating stations, which
became effective in October 2012. NPDES permits regulate specific industrial wastewater and storm water discharges to the waters of Indiana
under Sections 402 and 405 of the U.S. Clean Water Act. These permits set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the Harding Street
and Petersburg facilities, as well as monitoring and other requirements designed to protect aquatic life, with full compliance required by October
2015. In April 2013, IPL received an extension to the compliance deadline through September 29, 2017 for IPL's Harding Street and Petersburg
facilities through agreed orders with IDEM. IPL conducted studies to determine the operational changes and control equipment necessary to comply
with the new limitations. In October 2014, IPL filed its wastewater compliance plans for its power plants with the IURC. On July 29, 2015, the IURC
approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to convert Unit 7 at the Harding Street Station from coal-fired to natural gas-fired (about
410 MW net capacity) at a cost of up to $71 million (the IURC later approved IPL’s updated cost estimate for the Harding Street Station refuels
including $64 million for Unit 7), and also to install and operate wastewater treatment technologies at Harding Street Station and Petersburg
Generating Station at a cost of up to $326 million. The IURC order also granted IPL authority for timely rate recovery for 80% of the costs of these
projects and authority to defer the remaining 20% as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery through IPL’s next basic rate case proceeding.
However, there can be no assurances that IPL will be successful in that regard.

On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by power plants.
These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringent
effluent limitations for flue gas de-sulfurization wastewater. Compliance time lines for existing sources will be established by the applicable
permitting authorities and will be set as soon as determined possible, but no sooner than November 1, 2018 and no later than December 31, 2023.
IPL plans to install a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule described below in advance of the ELG compliance date. As such,
the impact of the ELG rule is not expected to be material. While we are still evaluating the impacts of the final rule for DP&L, we anticipate that
implementation of the requirements will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Selenium Rule — NPDES permits may be updated to include Selenium water quality based effluent limits based on a site specific evaluation

process which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final Selenium water quality standards for the specific
receiving water body utilizing actual and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the
total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional
capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. IPL would seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it
would be successful in this regard.

Waste Management — In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual
disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion residuals ("CCR"), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property,
but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is
disposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric
power and distribution facilities may include asbestos, CCR, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent
solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and PCB contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquid
wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating
CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable
minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, and may impose closure and/or
corrective action requirements for existing CCR landfills and impoundments under certain specified conditions. The primary enforcement
mechanisms under this

53

regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Water
Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIN Act), which includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program,
or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program.

The existing ash ponds at IPL's Petersburg Station do not meet certain structural stability requirements set forth in the CCR rule. As such, IPL
would be required to cease use of the ash ponds by April 17, 2017. However, IDEM has granted IPL a variance extending that deadline to April 11,
2018. In order to handle the bottom ash material that would otherwise be sluiced to the ash ponds, IPL plans to install a dry bottom ash handling
system at an estimated cost of approximately $47 million. On May 31, 2016, IPL filed its CCR compliance plans with the IURC. IPL is seeking
approval for a CPCN to install the bottom ash dewatering system at its Petersburg generating station. IPL expects to recover through its
environmental rate adjustment mechanism any operating or capital expenditures related to the installation of this system. Recovery of these costs is
sought through an Indiana statute that allows for 80% recovery of qualifying costs through a rate adjustment mechanism with the remainder
recorded as a regulatory asset to be considered for recovery in the next base rate case proceeding. However, there can be no assurances that IPL
will be successful in that regard. In light of the uncertainties at this time, we cannot predict the impact of these requirements on our consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but it may be material.

CERCLA — The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (aka "Superfund") may be the source of

claims against certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill
where a group of companies already recognized as potentially responsible parties have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a
contribution toward the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA
considers DP&L to be a potentially responsible party at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. EPA has taken no further action with respect to
DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any
liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.

Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation — In the second quarter of 2013, IPL retired in place five oil-fired peaking units with an average

life of approximately 61 years (approximately 168 MW net capacity in total), as such units were not equipped with the advanced environmental
control technologies needed to comply with existing and expected environmental regulations. Although these units represented approximately 5% of
IPL's generating capacity, they were seldom dispatched by Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. in recent years due to their relatively
higher production cost and in some instances repairs were needed. In addition to these recently retired units, IPL has several other generating units
that it expects to retire or refuel by 2017. These units are primarily coal-fired and represent 472 MW of net capacity in total. To replace this
generation, in April 2013, IPL filed a petition and case-in-chief with the IURC in April 2013 seeking a CPCN to build a 550 to 725 MW CCGT at its
Eagle Valley Station site in Indiana and to refuel Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (106 MW net capacity each). In May
2014, the IURC issued an order on the CPCN authorizing the refueling project and granting approval to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at a total
budget of $649 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $632 million. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance for
debt and equity funds used during construction and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project until such
time that IPL is allowed to collect both a return and depreciation expense on the CCGT and refueling project. The CCGT is expected to be placed
into service in the first half of 2018, and the refueling project was completed in December 2015. The costs to build and operate the CCGT and for
the refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the
IURC after the assets have been placed in service. For a discussion of the retirement of AES Southland's OTC generating units due to U.S. cooling
water intake regulations, please see — Cooling Water Intake, above.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7.—Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our
business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we

presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.— Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:

risks related to our high level of indebtedness;
risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;

•
•
• external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;
•
•

risks associated with our operations; and
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.

These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations , and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness

We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the

ability to fulfill our obligations.

As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding
borrowings, if any, under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital
stock of many of The AES Corporation's directly held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured by
substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must
be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the
amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. This
high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:

•

• making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;
•

increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and/or payments to increase under our debt and
related hedging instruments and consume an even greater portion of cash flow;
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign
exchange rates and commodity prices;
reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
• placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•

limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional
funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.

The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of

additional indebtedness. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described

57

above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be
sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets,
raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 11 —Debt included in Item 8.
of this Form 10-K for a schedule of our debt maturities.

The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public

debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.

The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. All of The AES Corporation's
revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of
its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not
only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees,
interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.

However, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are
obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other
conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation. In addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or
other payments to The AES Corporation may be subject to other contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions or may be prohibited altogether.
Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend.
Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting
the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Any right that The AES Corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries
upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right
of the holders of The AES Corporation's indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively
subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary).

The AES Corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES
Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds
available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.

Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could

adversely affect The AES Corporation.

We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted
below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured
solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to
as non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." In some non-recourse financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain
limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future
events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and
agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.

As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $20.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately

$4.7 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $15.8 billion was non-recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding
guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7.—
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Parent Company
Liquidity .

Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as
current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $128 million as of December 31, 2016 . While the lenders under our non-
recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES
Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation:

58

•

reducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project
subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;

• under certain circumstances, triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or

•
•

•
•

other credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
causing The AES Corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;
triggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. For example, The AES Corporation's senior secured
credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In
addition, The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material
debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;
the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the Company; or
foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from
those assets.

None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of
materiality in The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or
permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other
matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the
aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of
default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of The AES
Corporation.

Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital

The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.

The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund:

interest and preferred dividends;

construction and other project commitments;

• principal repayments of debt;
•
• acquisitions;
•
• other equity commitments, including business development investments;
• equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;
•
• Parent Company overhead costs.

taxes; and

The AES Corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:

• dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;
• proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and
• proceeds from asset sales.

For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7.— Management's

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity in this Form 10-K.

While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief

is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial
lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect, and, therefore there can be no
assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. For example, in
recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. In the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other
facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable

59

to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our
liquidity. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility and our debt
securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on
terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.

Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.

From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.

Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors,
some of which are beyond our control, including:

• general economic and capital market conditions;
•
•
•

the availability of bank credit;
investor confidence;
the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well
as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and
changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.

•

Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve

existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.

A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital

markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.

If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms

could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices
of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to
provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some
other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be
no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to
the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of
credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.

We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund developing projects in certain less developed economies which could change

or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy.

Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may

be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing
in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or
guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to
making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign related
risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be
available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our
investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.

External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility

Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the

wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.

Some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets in cases where they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or
retail load obligations. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and
falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of fuels such as
coal, natural gas

60

or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil
derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.

Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things:

illiquid markets;
transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;

• plant availability in the markets generally;
• availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
competition;
•
• electricity usage;
seasonality;
•
•
foreign exchange rate fluctuation;
• availability and price of emission credits;
• hydrology and other weather conditions;
•
•
• availability of competitively priced renewables sources;
•
• available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;
• generating unit performance;
• natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;
• energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
• geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas;
• general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and
• bidding behavior and market bidding rules.

increased adoption of distributed generation;

Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

experienced at our foreign operations.

Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional
currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. Dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the
U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. Dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a
result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the U.S. report could cause
significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same
currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's
functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial
position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies. See Item 7A. —Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk to this Form 10-K for further information.

We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.

We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other

commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or
indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on
exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our
assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we
have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or
interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices
may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to
the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge
accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased

61

volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk" which is the difference in performance between the
hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail
or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements.

Our coal-fired facilities in the U.S. continue to face substantial challenges as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, particularly

those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a
PPA in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not perfectly pass
through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel
supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material
impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.

Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.

We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services
required for the operation of certain of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing
fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any
price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of
agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders.

At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under

long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. We have also hedged a portion of
our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable
to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If
we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. A breach by a counterparty of a PPA or
other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.

The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material

adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued
performance by, suppliers and customers.

The market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods.

The market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the

future. Stock price movements on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in Item 5.— Market — Market Information of this
Form 10-K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in
which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as
developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in Item 1A.—
Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7.— Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations .

Risks Associated with our Operations

We do a significant amount of business outside the U.S., including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.

A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in
developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence
as such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in
some more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries,
entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
• economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
• adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
• government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
• unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;

62

• high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•
•
•

restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
risks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicable
to our operations;

• difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise;
• unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;
• unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to

subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are
governments or private parties;
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;

•
• adverse changes in government tax policy;
• difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and
• potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.

Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause
significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and
currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty
associated with cash flows from these businesses. A number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes.

The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our

financial results. We and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.

We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating

performance, including:

•

•

changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages,
equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to
comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures,
explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation;
purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and
capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.

Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water
sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production
and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or
unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a
material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital
expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair,
and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers.
The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on
our business and results of operations. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under
applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of
a liability for

63

liquidated damages and/or other penalties.

As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we

may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage.
Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment
and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and
wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate
internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks
depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and
specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these
risks.

The hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of

life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of
operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial
damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is
customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or
liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm
our financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will
continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our businesses' insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not

always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment
failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects.

Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain

additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our
foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the
difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. For example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business
transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise
in U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with U.S. reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial
controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.

We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and

plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.

We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty

regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our
operating costs. A significant under- or over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much
power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those
prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs.

We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. Even when we

successfully enter into long-term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and
a limited number of fuel suppliers.

Many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by

reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a

64

stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of,
and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales
contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering
into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the
continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively.
Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are
at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to
such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed
revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on
market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or
for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market
prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.

We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or

other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. However,
many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain
government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our
credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be
no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.

Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.

The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have

extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or
greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect
to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions
in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through
competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants have
also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors
could have a material adverse effect on us.

Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional

significant contributions.

Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the thirty one such
defined benefit plans, five are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of
actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries
and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong,
resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the
value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Company's exposure to market
volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in
fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. Future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the
inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in
pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for
satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension
obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent
Company and our subsidiaries' liquidity.

For additional information regarding the funding position of the Company's pension plans, see Item 7.— Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
and Note 15— Benefit Plans included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K.

65

Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.

Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have
signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial
risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals,
commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additional
information regarding our projects under construction see Item 1.— Business — Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K.

In certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured
financing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the development process. For example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct
contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement
in place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement without financing in place). If the project does not proceed,
our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and we
may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with
a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any
individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project
under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized
development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.

In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less
than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails
certain risks.

We have invested in some joint ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with

our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on
the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto
significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent
on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or
businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise,
human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our
business priorities. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder
agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.

The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our

interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or
investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the
profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise
unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these
joint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.

Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and

regulatory challenges.

Wind generation, our solar projects and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this

nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which
are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued
investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.

Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in
production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available
and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given
year.

66

As a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable
regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in
generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the
development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our
ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the
fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be
unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. Even where available, many of our renewable projects
sell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through
the sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emissions Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or Renewable Obligation
Certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to
obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects
or obtain third party financing for these projects.

Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.2% of the total assets

on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment
indicators are present. We may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we
experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment;
increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative or
declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a
significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could
result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our
acquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.

Long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are

evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also
evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.

Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.

Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on
the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns
and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can
adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and
summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from
normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.

In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our

hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric
generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Information security breaches could harm our business.

A security breach of our information technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and monitor operations could impact the
reliability of our generation fleets and/or the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems. A security breach that impairs our technology
infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customer
information and limit our communications with third parties. Our security measures may not prevent such security breaches. Any loss or corruption
of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could impair our reputation, expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections or
otherwise impact our operations, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

67

Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.

Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions.
Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these
businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses
may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire
any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:

such businesses will perform as expected;
integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;

• we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;
•
•
• we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;
•

•
• adverse changes in tax law;
•

such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to
develop them; or
the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.

Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws

Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely

affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.

Our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or

contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of
operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in
the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are
subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:

changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates
we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental
regulations;
changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the
rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;

•

•

•

changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their
obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;
changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;
changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
changes in the timing of tariff increases;

•
•
•
• other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;
• other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
• other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.

Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.

In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of

the regulations on our businesses. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. While the bulk of regulations contained in the
Dodd-Frank Act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive
compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. The types of provisions described above are currently not
expected to have a material impact on the Company or its results of operations. Furthermore, while the Dodd-Frank Act substantially expands the
regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for commercial end-user exemptions
which may apply to our derivative transactions. However, even with the exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on

68

the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non-exempt companies), could limit the
availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these
risks. Even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely (1) affect the
operating results of certain projects; (2) cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks,
such as project financing agreements; (3) prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; (4) cause the Company
to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; (5)
and/or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the Company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. In addition
to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2012, the EMIR became effective. EMIR includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives
and the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with EMIR. It is also possible that additional
similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on
the Company.

Our business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the

FERC and NERC, including PURPA, the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC, NERC and by state utility
commissions can have a material effect on our operations.

EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to remove the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the

purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable
presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., PJM Interconnection,
L.L.C., ISO New England, Inc., the NYISO and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to
QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under EPAct 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a
case-by-case basis. While this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market
environment when their current long-term contracts expire.

EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies

to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By
comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books
and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which
could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and
therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. generation market.

In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in

wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has
encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These
programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs.
Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new
transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.

While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the

construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of
reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.

FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as

well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the
violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty
authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially
have more serious consequences than in the past.

Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization ("ERO") to develop mandatory and

enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards
are subject to FERC review and approval.

69

Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations
with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Monetary
penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.

Our utility businesses in the U.S. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is

reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase,
or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the
issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses
face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,
and cash flows. See Item 1.— Business — US SBU — U.S. Businesses — U.S. Utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our U.S.
utilities.

Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.

Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international

treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of
water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to
comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could
result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to
become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented
various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. See the various
descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and
proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue
to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new
development of, environmental restrictions may force the Company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There
can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial
condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any
changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.

Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.

The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review

and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained
settlements with many of these companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications
to a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal, but not exclusive,
focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO 2 and NO x . In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and
required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO 2 and NO x . There can be no assurance that foreign
environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws
and regulations.

Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas,

or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As discussed in Item 1.— Business , at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under

development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them.
In 2016 , the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total CO 2 emissions of approximately 67.7 million metric tonnes,
approximately 30.2 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the U.S. (both figures ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO 2
emission estimation methodologies supported by "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power
generation plants, CO 2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel
heat inputs and fuel type CO 2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the
Company's

70

subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately
7.7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO 2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of
such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will
increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significant
uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these
estimates.

The non-utility, generation subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to contract counterparties,

but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the
cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of
the Company. The utility subsidiaries of the Company may seek to pass on any costs arising from CO 2 emissions to customers, but there can be no
assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover
such costs.

Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance.
The actual impact on the Company's financial performance and the financial performance of the Company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of
factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of
emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the
extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the
open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or
otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations.

In January 2005, based on European Community "Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading," the EU ETS
commenced operation as the largest multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became
effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires all developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO 2 .
However, the United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol and, to date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In December 2015, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ("UNFCCC") convened for the 21st

Conference of the Parties in Paris, France. The result was the so-called Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement has a long-term goal of keeping the
increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In furtherance of this goal, participating countries submitted
comprehensive national climate action plans and have agreed to meet every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science, to
report to each other and the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets and to track progress towards the long-term goal through a
robust transparency and accountability system. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend towards the efforts to de-carbonize
the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions, including in those countries where the Company does business. It is difficult to predict the
nature, timing and scope of such regulation but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.

In the U.S., there currently is no federal legislation imposing a mandatory GHG emission reduction programs (including for CO 2 ) affecting the

electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. However, the EPA has adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that
require new sources of GHG emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their
GHG emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification.
Additionally, the EPA has promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO 2 emissions for newly constructed and
modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW. The EPA has also promulgated a rule, the CPP, which requires existing EUSGUs
to begin reducing GHG emissions starting in 2022 with the full reduction requirement in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to develop and
submit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions trading programs, otherwise meet a state-wide emissions rate average or
mass-based goal. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emission, including the U.S. Supreme Court's issued an order staying
implementation of the CPP, see Item 1. —Business—Environmental and Land-Use Regulations—United States Environmental and Land-Use
Legislation and Regulations—Greenhouse Gas Emissions above.

71

Such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing EUSGUs, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and
have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. See Item 1.— Business of this Form 10-K for further discussion about
these environmental agreements, laws and regulations.

At the state level, the RGGI, a cap-and-trade program covering CO 2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast,
became effective in January 2009, and California has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires GHG reductions from multiple
industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below) and
proposed Hawaii regulations relating to the collection of fees on GHG emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the
Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with U.S. federal, regional or state GHG emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the
fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if
adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of California, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect such
costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements.

The auctions of RGGI allowances needed by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI occur approximately every
quarter. Our subsidiary in Maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to RGGI in 2016 . Of the approximately 30.2 million metric tonnes of CO 2
emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2016 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.1 million metric tonnes were emitted by our
subsidiary in Maryland. The Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $3.2 million for 2017 . There is a risk that
our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of
compliance.

In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing

concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which
would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. Further, rating
agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased
compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of its
subsidiaries' GHG emissions. While the litigation mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely
to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not

limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea
level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential
to significantly affect the Company's business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain
financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power
generation facilities and support facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also
would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Company's
subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could
prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that
result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.

In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the

Company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception
or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHG
emissions made by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company.

If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the
electric power generation businesses of the Company's subsidiaries and on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our subsidiaries have operations in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the

U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could
adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will
not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.

For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rules such as interest
deductibility and capital expenditure cost recovery, and U.S. international tax rules. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine
how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
("OECD"), in coordination with the G8 and G20, through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (“BEPS") introduced a series of
recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. As these and other tax laws, related regulations and
double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their
potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or
negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.

In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as non-U.S., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying

interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there
could be a material impact on our results of operations.

We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.

We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3.— Legal Proceedings below. There can be no

assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-term leases, none of which we
believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 —Business of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages or
other liens or encumbrances as part of the project's related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased.
However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be
subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued for
litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company
believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance
coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to
pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2016.

In 1989, Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras S.A. (“Eletrobrás”) filed suit in the Fifth District Court in the state of Rio de Janeiro (“FDC”) against
Eletropaulo Eletricidade de São Paulo S.A. (“EEDSP”) relating to the methodology for calculating monetary adjustments under the parties' financing
agreement. In April 1999, the FDC found in favor of Eletrobrás and in September 2001, Eletrobrás initiated an execution suit in the FDC to collect
approximately R$2.0 billion ( $602 million ) from Eletropaulo as estimated by Eletropaulo (or approximately R$2.6 billion ( $802 million ) as of
September 2016, as estimated by Eletrobrás, and possibly legal costs) and a lesser amount from an unrelated company, Companhia de
Transmissão de Energia Elétrica Paulista (“CTEEP”) (Eletropaulo and CTEEP were spun off of EEDSP pursuant to its privatization in 1998). In
November 2002, the FDC rejected Eletropaulo's defenses in the execution suit. On appeal, the case was remanded to the FDC for further
proceedings to determine whether Eletropaulo is liable for the debt. In December 2012, the FDC issued a decision that Eletropaulo is liable for the

73

debt. However, that decision was annulled on appeal and the case was remanded to the FDC for further proceedings. On remand at the FDC, the
FDC appointed an accounting expert to analyze the issues in the case. In September 2015, the expert issued a preliminary report concluding that
Eletropaulo is liable for the debt, without quantifying the debt. Eletropaulo thereafter submitted questions to the expert and reports rebutting the
expert's preliminary report. In April 2016, Eletrobrás requested that the expert determine both the criteria to calculate the debt and the amount of the
debt. The FDC is considering whether the criteria can be determined by the expert or must be determined by the FDC. After that issue is resolved, t
he expert may issue a final report. Ultimately, a decision will be issued by the FDC, which will be free to reject or adopt in whole or in part the
expert's report. If the FDC again determines that Eletropaulo is liable for the debt, Eletrobrás will be entitled to resume the execution suit in the FDC.
If Eletrobrás does so, Eletropaulo will be required to provide security for its alleged liability. In addition, in February 2008, CTEEP filed a lawsuit in
the FDC against Eletrobrás and Eletropaulo seeking a declaration that CTEEP is not liable for any debt under the financing agreement. Eletropaulo
believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no
assurances that it will be successful in its efforts. If Eletrobrás requests the seizure of the security noted above and the FDC grants such request (or
if a court determines that Eletropaulo is liable for the debt), Eletropaulo's results of operations may be materially adversely affected and, in turn, the
Company's results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Eletropaulo and the Company could face a loss of earnings and/or cash
flows and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value, and/or face the
possibility that Eletropaulo cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact
on the Company.

In September 1996, a public civil action was asserted against Eletropaulo and Associação Desportiva Cultural Eletropaulo (the “Associação”)

relating to alleged environmental damage caused by construction of the Associação near Guarapiranga Reservoir. The initial decision that was
upheld by the Appellate Court of the state of São Paulo in 2006 found that Eletropaulo should repair the alleged environmental damage by
demolishing certain construction and reforesting the area, and either sponsor an environmental project which would cost approximately R$2 million (
$614 thousand ) as of December 31, 2015, or pay an indemnification amount of approximately R$15 million ( $5 million ). Eletropaulo has appealed
this decision to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Appellate Court. Following the Supreme Court's decision, the
case has been remanded to the court of first instance for further proceedings and to monitor compliance by the defendants with the terms of the
decision. In January 2014, Eletropaulo informed the court that it intended to comply with the court's decision by donating a green area inside a
protection zone and restore watersheds, the aggregate cost of which is expected to be approximately R$2 million ( $614 thousand ). Eletropaulo
also requested that the court add the current owner of the land where the Associação facilities are located, Empresa Metropolitana de Águas e
Energia S.A. (“EMAE”), as a party to the lawsuit and order EMAE to perform the demolition and reforestation aspects of the court's decision. In July
2014, the court requested the Secretary of the Environment for the State of São Paulo to notify the court of its opinion regarding the acceptability of
the green areas to be donated by Eletropaulo to the State of São Paulo. In January 2015, the Secretary of the Environment for the State of São
Paulo notified Eletropaulo and the court that it would not accept Eletropaulo's proposed green areas donation. Instead of such green areas donation,
the Secretary of the Environment proposed in March 2015 that Eletropaulo undertake an environmental project to offset the alleged environmental
damage. Since March 2015, Eletropaulo and the Secretary of Environment have been working together to define an environmental project, which
will be submitted for approval by the Public Prosecutor. The cost of such project is currently estimated to be R$3 million ( $1 million ).

In December 2001, GRIDCO served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES

Orissa Distribution Private Limited (“AES ODPL”), and Jyoti Structures (“Jyoti”) pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between
GRIDCO, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (“CESCO”), an affiliate of the Company. In the
arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's indirect investment in CESCO
obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be
seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by
GRIDCO. The Company counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award
rejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to GRIDCO. The
respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, some of their costs
relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award has
been dismissed by the court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. The Company believes that it has

74

meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances
that it will be successful in its efforts.

In March 2003, the office of the Federal Public Prosecutor for the State of São Paulo, Brazil (“MPF”) notified Eletropaulo that it had commenced
an inquiry into the BNDES financings provided to AES Elpa and AES Transgás, the rationing loan provided to Eletropaulo, changes in the control of
Eletropaulo, sales of assets by Eletropaulo, and the quality of service provided by Eletropaulo to its customers. The MPF requested various
documents from Eletropaulo relating to these matters. In July 2004, the MPF filed a public civil lawsuit in the Federal Court of São Paulo (“FCSP”)
alleging that BNDES violated Law 8429/92 (“the Administrative Misconduct Act”) and BNDES's internal rules by: (1) approving the AES Elpa and
AES Transgás loans; (2) extending the payment terms on the AES Elpa and AES Transgás loans; (3) authorizing the sale of Eletropaulo's preferred
shares at a stock-market auction; (4) accepting Eletropaulo's preferred shares to secure the loan provided to Eletropaulo; and (5) allowing the
restructurings of Light Serviços de Eletricidade S.A. and Eletropaulo. The MPF also named AES Elpa and AES Transgás as defendants in the
lawsuit because they allegedly benefited from BNDES's alleged violations. In May 2006, the FCSP ruled that the MPF could pursue its claims based
on the first, second, and fourth alleged violations noted above. The MPF subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal with the Federal Court of
Appeals (“FCA”) seeking to require the FCSP to consider all five alleged violations. In April 2015, the FCA issued a decision holding that the FCSP
should consider all five alleged violations. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana (the successor of AES Transgás) have appealed the April 2015 decision to
the Superior Court of Justice. The lawsuit remains pending before the FCSP. AES Elpa and AES Brasiliana believe they have meritorious defenses
to the allegations asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that they
will be successful in their efforts.

Pursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at a

pole factory that AES Florestal had been operating. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de
Energia (“CEEE”), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES
Florestal communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the
State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order
requiring the companies to recover the contaminated area located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately
R$6 million ( $2 million ) to the state's Environmental Fund. In October 2011, the State Attorney Office filed a request for an injunction ordering the
defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined
only that defendant CEEE was required to proceed with the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with the
injunction. The removal costs are estimated to be approximately R$60 million ( $18 million ) and the work was completed in February 2014. In
parallel with the removal activities, a court-appointed expert investigation took place, which was concluded in May 2014. The court-appointed expert
final report was presented to the State Attorneys in October 2014, and in January 2015 to the defendant companies. In March 2015, AES Sul and
AES Florestal submitted comments and supplementary questions regarding the expert report. The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be
successful in its efforts.

In March 2009, AES Uruguaiana Empreendimentos S.A. (“AESU”) in Brazil initiated arbitration against YPF S.A. (“YPF”) seeking damages and

other relief relating to YPF's breach of the parties' gas supply agreement (“GSA”). Thereafter, in April 2009, YPF initiated arbitration against AESU
and two unrelated parties, Companhia de Gas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul and Transportador de Gas del Mercosur S.A. (“TGM”), claiming that
AESU wrongfully terminated the GSA and caused the termination of a transportation agreement (“TA”) between YPF and TGM (“YPF Arbitration”).
YPF sought an unspecified amount of damages from AESU, a declaration that YPF's performance was excused under the GSA due to certain
alleged force majeure events, or, in the alternative, a declaration that the GSA and the TA should be terminated without a finding of liability against
YPF because of the allegedly onerous obligations imposed on YPF by those agreements. In addition, in the YPF Arbitration, TGM asserted that if
AESU were found liable for terminating the GSA, AESU should also be found liable for TGM's alleged losses, under the TA. In April 2011, the
arbitrations were consolidated into a single proceeding. In May 2013, the arbitral tribunal issued an award finding YPF liable to AESU and TGM.
Thereafter, in April 2016, the tribunal issued a damages award ordering YPF to pay damages to AESU and TGM. In January 2017, AESU and YPF
settled their dispute.

In October 2009, IPL received a NOV and Finding of Violation from the EPA pursuant to the CAA Section 113(a). The NOV alleges violations of
the CAA at IPL's three primarily coal-fired electric generating facilities dating back to 1986. The alleged violations primarily pertain to the Prevention
of Significant Deterioration and nonattainment

75

New Source Review requirements under the CAA. IPL management previously met with EPA staff regarding possible resolutions of the NOV. At this
time, we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of similar cases have required companies
to pay civil penalties, install additional pollution control technology on coal-fired electric generating units, retire existing generating units, and invest
in additional environmental projects. A similar outcome in this case could have a material impact to IPL and could, in turn, have a material impact on
the Company. IPL would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air
emissions; however, there can be no assurances that it would be successful in that regard.

In June 2011, the São Paulo Municipal Tax Authority (the “Tax Authority”) filed 60 tax assessments in São Paulo administrative court against
Eletropaulo, seeking to collect services tax (“ISS”) that allegedly had not been paid on revenues for services rendered by Eletropaulo. Eletropaulo
challenged the assessments on the grounds that the revenues at issue were not subject to ISS. In October 2013, the First Instance Administrative
Court (“FIAC”) determined that Eletropaulo was liable for ISS, interest, and related penalties totaling approximately R$3.3 billion ( $1.0 billion ) as
estimated by Eletropaulo. Eletropaulo thereafter appealed to the Second Instance Administrative Court (“SIAC”). In January 2016, the Tax Authority
nullified most of the ISS sought from Eletropaulo.In January 2017, the SIAC issued a decision confirming the reduction and rejecting certain other
amounts of ISS as time-barred, but finding that Eletropaulo was liable for the remainder of ISS totaling approximately R$200 million ( $61 million ).
The matter is on appeal before the Municipal Council of Taxes. Eletropaulo believes it has meritorious defenses and will defend itself vigorously in
these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.

In January 2012, the Brazil Federal Tax Authority issued an assessment alleging that AES Tietê had paid PIS and COFINS taxes from 2007 to

2010 at a lower rate than the tax authority believed was applicable. AES Tietê challenged the assessment on the grounds that the tax rate was set
in the applicable legislation. In April 2013, the FIAC determined that AES Tietê should have calculated the taxes at the higher rate and that AES
Tietê was liable for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties totaling approximately R$960 million ( $295 million ) as estimated by AES Tietê. AES Tietê
appealed to the SIAC. In January 2015, the SIAC issued a decision in AES Tietê's favor, finding that AES Tietê was not liable for unpaid taxes. The
public prosecutor subsequently filed an appeal, which was denied as untimely. The Tax Authority thereafter filed a motion for clarification of the
SIAC's decision, which was denied in September 2016. The Tax Authority later filed a special appeal, but that appeal was rejected in October 2017.
The Tax Authority has filed an interlocutory appeal, which is pending. AES Tietê believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim and will defend
itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.

In January 2015, DPL received NOVs from the EPA alleging violations of opacity at Stuart and Killen Stations, and in October 2015, IPL
received a similar NOV alleging violations at Petersburg Station. In February 2016, IPL received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of New
Source Review (“NSR”) and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. It is too early to
determine whether the NOVs could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of our operations. IPL would seek recovery
of any operating or capital expenditures, but not fines or penalties, related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions;
however, there can be no assurances that we would be successful in this regard.

In September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal

Commission (the “CCC”) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redondo Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional
wetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in
violation of the California Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program and has ordered AES Redondo Beach to restore the site.
Additional potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to fund a wetland mitigation project
and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments and intends to vigorously prosecute such lawsuit, but
there can be no assurances that it will be successful.

In October 2015, Ganadera Guerra, S.A. (“GG”) and Constructora Tymsa, S.A. (“CT”) filed separate lawsuits against AES Panama in the local

courts of Panama. The claimants allege that AES Panama profited from a hydropower facility (La Estrella) being partially located on land owned
initially by GG and currently by CT, and that AES Panama must pay compensation for its use of the land. The damages sought from AES Panama
are approximately $685 million (GG) and $100 million (CT). In October 2016, the court dismissed GG's claim because of GG's failure to comply with
a court order requiring GG to disclose certain information. It is expected that GG will refile its lawsuit. Also, there are ongoing administrative
proceedings concerning whether AES Panama is entitled to

76

acquire an easement over the land and whether AES Panama can continue to occupy the land. AES Panama believes it has meritorious defenses
and claims and will assert them vigorously; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.

Stock Repurchase Program — The Board authorization permits the Company to repurchase stock through a variety of methods, including

open market repurchases and/or privately negotiated transactions. There can be no assurances as to the amount, timing or prices of repurchases,
which may vary based on market conditions and other factors. The Program does not have an expiration date and can be modified or terminated by
the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company repurchased 8.7 million shares of its common stock at
a total cost of $79 million under the existing stock repurchase program. The cumulative repurchase from the commencement of the Program in July
2010 through December 31, 2016 is 154.3 million shares at a total cost of $1.9 billion , at an average price per share of $12.12 (including a nominal
amount of commissions). As of December 31, 2016, $246 million remained available for repurchase under the Program.

No repurchases were made by The AES Corporation of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2016 .

Executive Summary

Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2,884 million , an increase of $750
million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher collections at the Company’s distribution
business in Brazil, Eletropaulo and Sul, and the settlement of overdue receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria. These positive contributions were offset by
lower margins across the SBUs (primarily due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers in the U.S., lower
contracted rates in Tietê , the prior year liability reversal in Eletropaulo and unfavorable FX in Kazakhstan), as well as the recovery of overdue
receivables in the Dominican Republic in 2015, which benefited

80

2015 results. Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $176 million to $1,417
million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the same factors as Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating
Activities.

(2)   Disclosure of Proportional Free Cash Flow will be discontinued beginning in the first quarter of 2017. See further discussion under SBU Performance Analysis—Non-GAAP Measures.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased primarily due to higher impairment expense on long lived assets, lower gains

on foreign currency derivatives, lower operating margins at our US, Brazil and Europe SBUs, and lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to the
gain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of Guacolda; partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, the absence of goodwill impairment expense in
the current year, lower losses on extinguishment of debt and lower share count.

Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, decreased by 22% to $0.98 primarily driven by lower operating margins at our US, Brazil, and Europe

SBUs, lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to the gain earned in 2015 from the restructuring of Guacolda; partially offset by a lower adjusted
effective tax rate and lower share count.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 35% to $2.9 billion primarily driven by an increase in collections at our Brazil utilities, the

collection of overdue receivables at Maritza, and lower costs associated with the fulfillment of our service concession arrangement and lower
working capital requirements at Mong Duong. These positive impacts were partially offset by the timing of payments at our Brazil utilities for higher
energy purchases made in the prior year, collections of overdue receivables in the prior year in the Dominican Republic, and lower net income
adjusted for non-cash items.

Proportional free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 14% to $1.4 billion primarily driven by an increase in collections at our Brazil

utilities, the collection of overdue receivables at Maritza, and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong. These positive impacts were
partially offset by the timing of payments at our Brazil utilities for higher energy purchases made in the prior year, collections of overdue receivables
in the prior year in the Dominican Republic, and a decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin (a non-GAAP measure).

Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin — Revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities

and the production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives associated with the sale of electricity.

Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel
purchases, operations & maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative
and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or
losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity
or fuel.

Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.

Consolidated Revenue and Operating Margin

(in millions)

Year Ended December 31, 2016

Consolidated Revenue — Revenue decrease d in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to:

• Unfavorable FX impacts of $511 million , primarily in Brazil of $ 213 million , Argentina of $94 million, Kazakhstan of $63 million and Colombia of

$54 million.

• Brazil due to lower rates for energy sold in Brazil under new contracts at Tietê; operations in 2015 but not in 2016 at Uruguiana; the reversal of a

contingent regulatory liability in 2015, and lower demand, partially offset by the annual tariff adjustment at Eletropaulo.

• Lower pass-through costs at El Salvador and IPP4 in Jordan, the sale of DPLER in January 2016, and lower rates at DPL.

These decreases were partially offset by:

• The full operations at Mong Duong in 2016 compared to Unit 1 in March 2015 with principal operations commencing in April 2015

• The commencement of operations at Cochrane in Chile with Unit 1 operational in July 2016 and principal operations in October).
• Higher environmental returns and new rate case at IPL.

Consolidated Operating Margin — Operating margin decrease d in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to:

• Unfavorable FX impacts of $80 million , primarily in Kazakhstan, Argentina, and Colombia.

• Brazil driven by the revenue drivers above as well as higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo.

These decreases were partially offset by:

• Higher margin at Gener, impact from full operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam and Cochrane in Chile, and higher margins at IPL as discussed

above.

Year Ended December 31, 2015

Consolidated Revenue — Revenue decrease d in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:

• Unfavorable FX impacts of $2.2 billion, mainly in Brazil of $1.8 billion, Colombia of $179 million, and Bulgaria of $74 million.
• US Utilities due to lower volumes primarily at DPL and outages, milder weather, and lower demand at IPL.
• Lower prices in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador (primarily resulting from lower pass-through costs).

These decreases were partially offset by:

• Brazil due to higher tariffs at Eletropaulo (including higher pass-through costs) and the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo.
• Higher capacity prices at DPL.
• Commencement of principal operations at Mong Duong in April 2015.

83

Consolidated Operating Margin — Operating margin decrease d in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to:

• Unfavorable FX impacts of $362 million , primarily in Brazil of $228 million and Colombia of $83 million.
• Brazil due to lower demand, lower hydrology, and higher fixed costs.
• The Dominican Republic due to lower prices and lower availability.

These decreases were partially offset by:

• Higher tariffs in Brazil as discussed above and lower spot prices on energy purchases at Tietê.

• Higher generation and lower energy purchases driven by improved hydrological conditions in Panama.
• Higher prices at Chivor driven by a strong El Niño.
• Higher availability at Gener and Masinloc.

See Item 7. —SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each SBU.

Consolidated Results of Operations — Other

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance,

legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs.

General and administrative expenses decrease d in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to decreased employee-related costs, partially offset by

increased business development costs.

General and administrative expenses increase d in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased business development costs and employee-

related costs partially offset by decreased professional fees.

Interest expense

Interest expense increase d in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to a $97 million increase at Eletropaulo as a result of the prior year reversal of
$64 million in interest expense, previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability, and increased interest expense due to higher regulatory
liabilities and interest rates in the current year. Additionally, there was a $26 million increase at Mong Duong, mainly due to this entity no longer
capitalizing interest as a result of the commencement of operations in April 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense of
$22 million due to a reduction in debt principal at the Parent Company.

Interest expense decrease d in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower interest expense of $63 million at the Parent Company due to a
reduction in debt principal, and a $64 million reversal of interest expense previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability at Eletropaulo.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase at Mong Duong as the plant commenced operations in April 2015 and ceased capitalizing
interest.

Interest income

Interest income increase d in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher interest income of $19 million recognized on the financing element of the
service concession arrangement at Mong Duong, which became fully operational in April 2015, partially offset by lower interest income of $16 million
in Argentina due to prior year recognition of accumulated interest on VAT balances related to CAMESSA.

Interest income increase d in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to interest income of $114 million recognized in 2015 on the financing element of

the service concession arrangement at Muong Duong, as well as an increase of $36 million at Eletropaulo resulting from higher interest rates and an
increase in regulatory assets.

Loss on extinguishment of debt

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to expense of $14 million recognized

on debt extinguishment at the Parent Company.

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . This loss was primarily related to expense of $105
million , $22 million , and $19 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the Parent Company, IPL, and the Dominican Republic, respectively.

Loss on extinguishment of debt was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily related to expense of $193 million

, $31 million , and $20 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the Parent

84

Company, DPL, and Gener, respectively.

Other income and expense

Other income decreased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to gains on early contract termination in 2015 and lower gains on asset sales in

2016; partially offset by an increase in allowance for funds used during construction as a result of increased construction activity at IPL.

Other income decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower gains on asset sales in 2015 and the 2014 reversal of a liability in

Kazakhstan due to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the Republic of Kazakhstan to claim payment from AES.

Other expense increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to the 2016 recognition a full allowance on a non-trade receivable in the MCAC SBU

as a result of payment delays and discussions with the counterparty. The allowance relates to certain reimbursements the Company was expecting
in connection with a legal matter. Management believes the counterparty is obligated to pay and plans to continue to attempt to fully collect the non-
trade receivable.

Other expense decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower losses on sales and disposal of assets at Termo Andes and Eletropaulo.

See Note 19 — Other Income and Expense included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further

information.

Gain on disposal and sale of businesses

Gain on sale of businesses was $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which was primarily related to the gain on sale of DPLER,

partially offset by a loss on the deconsolidation of U.K. Wind.

Gain on sale of businesses was $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which was primarily related to the sale of Armenia

Mountain.

Gain on disposal and sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $358 million , which was primarily related to the sale of

45% of the Company's interest in Masinloc, as well as the sale of U.K. Wind (Operating Projects).

Goodwill impairment expense

There were no goodwill impairments for the year ended December 31, 2016 .

Goodwill impairment expense was $317 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a goodwill impairment at DP&L.

Goodwill impairment expense was $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . This expense consisted of $136 million , $20 million

and $8 million of goodwill impairments at DPLER, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap I, respectively.

See Note 9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for

further information.

Asset impairment expense

Asset impairment expense was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 . This was primarily related to asset impairments of $859

million , $159 million and $77 million at DPL, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap I, respectively.

Asset impairment expense was $285 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to asset impairments of $121 million , $116

million and $37 million at Kilroot, Buffalo Gap III and U.K. Wind, respectively.

Asset impairment expense was $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to asset impairments of $67 million , $12

million and $12 million at Ebute, U.K. Wind and DPL, respectively.

See Note 20 — Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further

information.

Income tax expense

Income tax decreased to a benefit of $188 million in 2016 as compared to expense of $472 million in 2015. The Company's effective tax rates

were ( 137% ) and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

85

The net decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the 2016 asset impairments in the U.S. and to the current year benefit
related to a restructuring of one of our Brazilian businesses that increases tax basis in long-term assets. Further, the 2015 rate was impacted by the
items described below. See Note 20— Asset Impairment Expense for additional information regarding the 2016 U.S. asset impairments.

Income tax expense increase d $101 million , or 27% , to $472 million in 2015 . The Company's effective tax rates were 41% and 26% for the

years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

The net increase in the 2015 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the nondeductible 2015 impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DP&L and
Chilean withholding taxes offset by the release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in Brazil, Vietnam and the U.S. Further, the 2014
rate was impacted by the sale of approximately 45% of the Company’s interest in Masin AES Pte Ltd., which owns the Company’s business
interests in the Philippines and the 2014 sale of the Company’s interests in four U.K. wind operating projects. Neither of these transactions gave rise
to income tax expense. See Note 15 — Equity for additional information regarding the sale of approximately 45% of the Company’s interest in
Masin-AES Pte Ltd. See Note 23 — Dispositions for additional information regarding the sale of the Company’s interests in four U.K. wind operating
projects.

Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S.

statutory rate of 35%. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions
could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific
commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 21 — Income Taxes for additional information regarding these reduced rates.

Includes gains of $17 million , $247 million and $172 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction loss of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to losses

of $50 million at The AES Corporation mainly due to remeasurement losses on intercompany notes, and losses on swaps and options.

This loss was partially offset by gains of $37 million in Argentina, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign currency derivatives related to

government receivables.

The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to gains

of:

• $124 million in Argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by
losses from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso associated with U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and losses at Termoandes (a U.S. Dollar
functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency,

• $29 million in Colombia, mainly due to the depreciation of the Colombian Peso, positively impacting Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency

subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos,

• $11 million in the United Kingdom, mainly due to the depreciation of the Pound Sterling, resulting in gains at Ballylumford Holdings (a U.S. Dollar

functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable denominated in Pound Sterling, and

86

These gains were partially offset by losses of:

• $31 million at The AES Corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign

currency, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option
purchases, and

• $18 million in Chile primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) from working

capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, partially offset by gains on foreign currency derivatives.

The Company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gains of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to gains

of:

• $66 million in Argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by
losses from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso associated with U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and losses at Termoandes (a U.S. Dollar
functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency, and the purchase of Argentine
sovereign bonds,

• $17 million in Colombia, mainly due to a 23% depreciation of the Colombian Peso, positively impacting Chivor (a U.S. Dollar functional currency

subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in Colombian Pesos, primarily income tax payable and accounts payable,

• $12 million in the United Kingdom, mainly due to a 6% depreciation of the Pound Sterling, resulting in gains at Ballylumford Holdings (a U.S.

Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable denominated in Pound Sterling, and gains related to foreign
currency derivatives, and

• $11 million in the Philippines, mainly due to amortization of frozen embedded derivatives and a 4% appreciation of the Philippine Peso against

the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables, and deferred tax asset.

These gains were partially offset by losses of:

• $34 million at The AES Corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign

currency, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option
purchases,

• $30 million in Chile primarily due to a 16% devaluation of the Chilean Peso, resulting in a $39 million loss at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional
currency subsidiary) from working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, primarily cash, accounts receivable and VAT receivables, partially
offset by income of $9 million on foreign currency derivatives, and

• $14 million in Mexico, primarily due to a 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso, resulting in a loss at TEGTEP and Merida (U.S. Dollar functional

currency subsidiaries) from working capital denominated in Pesos (primarily cash, recoverable tax, and VAT).

Other non-operating expense

There were no significant non-operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

Other non-operating expense was $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to impairments recognized at Entek and Silver

Ridge.

See Note 8 — Other Non-Operating Expense included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further

information.

Net equity in earnings of affiliates

Net equity in earnings of affiliates decrease d in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of the restructuring of Guacolda in September 2015, which

resulted in a $66 million benefit. No comparable transaction occurred in 2016.

Net equity in earnings of affiliates increase d in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the restructuring of Guacolda in September 2015, which

resulted in a $66 million benefit, as well as the impairment at Elsta in 2014.

See Note 7 —Investments In and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K

for further information.

Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests

Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decrease d in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of:

• a decrease at Tietê due to lower earnings
• a decrease at Eletropaulo resulting from the the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability in 2015, and
• asset impairments at Buffalo Gap I and II;

Partially offset by:

• a lower asset impairment at Buffalo Gap III in 2015, and
•

income tax benefits at Eletropaulo.

Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increase d in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of:

• an increase at Mong Duong due to commencement of operations in 2015,

• an increase at Gener primarily due to the restructuring of Guacolda,
• an increase at Masinloc due to increased earnings in 2015 and the 2014 sale of a noncontrolling interest in that business

Partially offset by:

• a decrease at Buffalo Gap III resulting from the asset impairment expense allocation to the tax equity partner, and
• a decrease at Eletropaulo resulting from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower demand.

Loss from discontinued operations

Total loss from discontinued operations in 2016 and 2015 was due to the sale of AES Sul. The loss in 2016 includes an after tax loss on
impairment of $382 million recognized in the second quarter of 2016 and an additional after tax loss on sale of $737 million upon disposal of AES
Sul in October 2016. There were no significant changes in loss from operations related to the AES Sul discontinued business.

Total income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to AES Sul, Cameroon, Saurashtra and

U.S. wind projects.

See Note 22 — Discontinued Operations included in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further

information.

Net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation

Net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation decrease d in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of:

impairments and loss on sale at discontinued businesses;

•
• higher impairment expense on long lived assets;
•
•
•

lower operating margins at our US, Brazil and Europe SBUs;
lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to the 2015 restructuring at Guacolda; and
lower gains on foreign currency derivatives.

These decreases were partially offset by:

lower effective tax rate;

lower debt extinguishment expense; and

•

•

• absence of goodwill impairment expense.

Net income attributable to The AES Corporation decrease d in 2015 compared to 2014 as result of:

• Higher impairment expense
• Lower gains from the sale of businesses

These decreases were partially offset by:

• Lower debt extinguishment expense

SBU Performance Analysis

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, Adjusted EPS, and Proportional Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are

used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.

Adjusted Operating Margin

We define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, adjusted for the impact of NCI, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to

derivative transactions. See Review of Consolidated Results of Operations for definitions of Operating Margin and cost of sales.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is Operating Margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better

reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determination include the impact of NCI, where AES consolidates the
results of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. Adjusted
Operating Margin should not be construed as an alternative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted PTC

We define Adjusted PTC as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses due to

(a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to
dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC
also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.

Adjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales
reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our income statement, such as general and administrative expense
in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs; interest expense and interest income ; other expense and other income ; realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses ; and net equity in earnings of affiliates .

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation . We believe

that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of
financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions,
unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire
debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before
the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in
which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to The AES
Corporation , which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EPS

We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and

entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign
currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs
due to the early retirement of debt.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted

EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial
performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized
foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which
affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

Proportional Free Cash Flow

We define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable
environmental capital expenditures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. The proportionate share of cash flows and related
adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation
below. Upon the Company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective January 1, 2015, capital
expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows are now classified as operating activities. See Note 1 —General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K for further
information on the adoption of this guidance.

Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows

for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below.

We also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms.

An example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is IPL's investment in MATS-related environmental upgrades that are recovered
through a tracker. See Item 1. —US SBU—IPL—Environmental Matters for details of these investments.

The GAAP measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. We believe that proportional free
cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding
of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing in growth opportunities or repaying debt. Factors in this determination
include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company.

92

The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from

operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for
discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements
and dividend payments. Our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other
companies.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will no longer include these non-GAAP proportional free cash flow disclosures that have historically
been provided and will instead disclose non-GAAP free cash flows only on a consolidated basis. Our use of proportional free cash flow was intended
to provide investors with an understanding of the portion of free cash flows attributable to AES after the impact of non-controlling interests. However,
since the concept of a non-controlling interest is not contemplated under GAAP with respect to the statement of cash flows, we will no longer be able
to disclose proportional free cash flow in light of recent interpretive guidance issued by the SEC staff.

(1)   Service concession asset expenditures are excluded from the proportional free cash flow non-GAAP metric.
(2)   The proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by

multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. For example, Parent Company A owns
20% of Subsidiary Company B, a consolidated subsidiary. Thus, Subsidiary Company B has an 80% noncontrolling interest. Assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from
Subsidiary B, the proportional adjustment factor for Subsidiary B would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). The Company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner
and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. The proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to
noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) AES' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur.

(3)

Includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $15 million and $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company adopted
service concession accounting effective January 1, 2015.

(4)   Excludes IPL's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $132 million , $205 million and $163 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

Parent Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure)

The Company defines Parent Free Cash Flow as dividends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cash

costs at the Parent Company level, primarily interest payments, overhead, and development costs. Parent Free Cash Flow is used to fund
shareholder dividends, share repurchases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the Parent Company. Refer to Item 1
— Business — Overview for further discussion of the Parent Company's capital allocation strategy.

Total US Generation Decrease

DPL

Impact of lower wholesale prices and completion of DP&L’s transition to a competitive-bid market

Adjusted Operating Margin decrease d $85 million for the US SBU due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative gains

and losses and adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted PTC decrease d $13 million driven by the decrease of $85 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, partially offset by a

gain on contract termination at DP&L, lower interest expense at DPL and IPL in part due to the sell-down impacts as discussed above and the
impact of HLBV at our Distributed Energy business as a result of new projects achieving COD in 2016.

Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $23 million , primarily driven by a $93 million decrease in coal purchases due to the ongoing
conversion of coal generation assets to natural gas at IPL, a build-up of inventory due to mild winter weather in December 2015, and inventory
optimization efforts at DPL. Additionally, Proportional Free Cash Flow benefited from a $32 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of
vendor payments, $17 million in net settlements of accounts receivable primarily resulting from the sale of DPLER in 2016, and lower interest
payments of $19 million due to timing and lower interest rates. These positive impacts were partially offset by an $81 million decrease in Adjusted
Operating Margin (net of non-cash impacts of $4 million, primarily related to the implementation of IPL’s new rates and depreciation), and a $84
million decrease in the timing of receivables collections resulting primarily from higher rates at IPL, more favorable weather in 2016, and the impact
of DPLER’s declining customer base in 2015.

Fiscal year 2015 versus 2014

Operating margin decrease d by $78 million , or 11% , which was driven primarily by the following:

DPL

Impact of more of DP&L's generation being sold in the wholesale market at lower prices in 2015 compared to supplying DP&L retail customers in 2014,
lower generation driven by plant outages in 2015, and unfavorable weather; partially offset by the impact of outages and lower gas availability occurring in
Q1 2014

Adjusted PTC decrease d $85 million driven by the decrease of $113 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above as well as a
decrease in the Company's share of earnings under the HLBV allocation of noncontrolling interest at Buffalo Gap, partially offset by IPL due to lower
interest expense related to the impact of the sell down and increased AFUDC, and DPL due to lower interest expense.

Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $55 million , primarily driven by the $113 million decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin described
above, and a $22 million increase in maintenance and non-recoverable capital expenditures. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $22
million increase due to the collection of previously deferred storm costs, a one-time payment of $19 million in 2014 to terminate an unfavorable coal
contract, higher collections of $16 million due to settlement of a receivable balance related to the sale of MC 2 in 2015, and the timing of inventory
payments of $16 million at DPL. Additionally, Proportional Free Cash Flow was favorably impacted by the timing of power purchase payments of $7
million and the timing of $9 million of receivables collections at IPL.

Adjusted Operating Margin decrease d $24 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted PTC decrease d $92 million , driven by the decrease in Equity Earnings of $54 million mainly related to Guacolda’s reorganization in
September 2015, the decrease of $24 million in Adjusted Operating Margin and the increase of $12 million in interest expense primarily associated
to lower interest capitalization after beginning of commercial operations at Cochrane.

Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $40 million , primarily driven by $57 million in collections of financing receivables and the timing of

maintenance remuneration from CAMMESSA in Argentina, a $25 million positive impact related to a one-time interest rate swap termination
payment at Ventanas in July 2015, a decrease of $58 million in working capital requirements at Chivor mainly related to collections of prior period
sales, and a $23 million reduction in proportional maintenance and non-recoverable capital expenditures due to lower expenditures on

96

emissions control equipment at Chile. These positive impacts were partially offset by a reduction of $4 million in Adjusted Operating Margin (net of
non-cash impacts), $43 million of lower VAT refunds related to our Cochrane and Alto Maipo construction projects, higher net tax payments of $56
million primarily related to withholding taxes paid on Chilean distributions to AES Affiliates and higher taxable income in Colombia, and $18 million of
higher interest payments primarily as a consequence of debt refinancing at higher interest rates and lower interest capitalization under construction
projects.

Adjusted Operating Margin increase d $22 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted PTC increase d $61 million driven by a restructuring of Guacolda in Chile which increased our equity investment and resulted in

additional Equity Earnings of $46 million as well as realized FX gains, lower interest expense at Chivor and the $22 million in Adjusted Operating
Margin described above. This was partially offset by lower equity earnings at Guacolda of $16 million (excluding restructuring impact above) mainly
driven by a 2014 gain on sale of a transmission line.

Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $48 million , primarily driven by $107 million higher VAT refunds at Cochrane and Alto Maipo, $27
million of non-recurring maintenance collections in Argentina, and a $17 million decrease in interest payments. These positive impacts were partially
offset by $49 million of higher tax payments and $25 million of lower collections primarily from contract customers at Chivor, and a $25 million
impact related to a one-time interest rate swap termination payment at Ventanas in July 2015.

as a discontinued operation (not included in the $1 million increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above), higher energy purchases of $59
million at Tietê due to the timing of purchases in the spot market at higher prices, unfavorable timing of $32 million of higher costs deferred in net
regulatory assets at Sul as result of unfavorable hydrology, and $17 million of higher interest payments at Sul due to a higher debt balance and
higher interest rate. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable timing of $121 million in payments for energy purchases and
regulatory charges at Eletropaulo and Sul, $31 million of lower income tax payments at Tietê, and favorable timing of $14 million in net collections of
higher costs deferred in net regulatory assets in the prior year at Eletropaulo.

Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $49 million , primarily driven by a decrease of $29 million in working capital requirements at Mong
Duong due to a build up in the prior year in preparation for commencement of plant operations, and an increase in Adjusted Operating Margin of $35

expense as interest is no longer capitalized. See Note 1— General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II.—Item 8.— Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the accounting for service concession arrangements.

Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $5 million , primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted Operating Margin of $28 million (net of $9 million

in non-cash items, primarily service concession expense and the

financing component under service concession accounting. These positive impacts were partially offset by $26 million in higher working capital
requirements at Mong Duong due to a build-up in preparation of the commencement of operations, $22 million in higher interest payments at Mong
Duong, $11 million of higher tax payments at Masinloc, and $9 million in higher working capital requirements at Masinloc due primarily to the timing
of coal purchases.

Key Trends and Uncertainties

During 2017 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved
operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If
these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we
currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors
unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our
operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.— Business and Item 1A.— Risk Factors of
this Form 10-K.

Macroeconomic and Political

During 2016, the political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed which could result in

significant impacts to tax laws, and environmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to
volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further information.

Brazil — President Michel Temer, with majority congressional support, continues to implement the fiscal reforms needed to improve the
country’s finances. While uncertainty dominates the political arena, if enacted, President Temer's market reforms would improve the the economic
outlook, which may benefit our businesses in Brazil.

In October 2016, AES completed the sale of the Company's 100% ownership interest in AES Sul and recognized an after-tax loss on disposal

of $737 million. This after-tax loss excludes the impact of contingent proceeds linked to the favorable settlement of pending litigation, which is not
guaranteed. If the case is decided in the Company's favor, amounts would be remitted to AES over an unknown period of time. Any potential gain
from the eventual resolution of this contingency would be presented separately as Discontinued Operations.

United Kingdom — On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union
(“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of
the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unclear what the long-term global implications will be, it is possible that the European or
U.K. economy could weaken and our businesses may experience a decline in demand. While the full impact of the Brexit is uncertain, these
changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most immediate impact has been a devaluation of the pound and euro
against the U.S. dollar. For 2016 and 2017, the Company has hedged against these foreign currency movements, however, the impact could be
greater in future years.

Puerto Rico — Our subsidiaries in Puerto Rico have long term PPAs with state-owned PREPA. Due to the ongoing economic situation in the

territory, PREPA faces significant financial challenges. There have been no significant adverse impacts to AES Puerto Rico due to PREPA’s
financial challenges.

If PREPA continues to face challenges, or those challenges worsen, or otherwise impact PREPA’s ability to make payments to AES Puerto

Rico, there could be a material impact on the Company.

United States of America — The outcome of the 2016 U.S. elections could result in significant changes to U.S. tax laws, and environmental

and energy policies, the impact of which is uncertain.

Philippines — The outcome of the 2016 Philippines election could result in changes in policies towards the U.S., China or other nations the

impact of which on our business is uncertain.

Foreign Exchange and Commodities

Our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities,

particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. In 2016, there were more than 50% improvement in both oil and natural gas
prices, which had a positive impact on our businesses in the Dominican Republic, Ohio and Northern Ireland. Since we operate in multiple countries,
we are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the U.S.

Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. In 2016, we had a significant devaluation in the Argentine Peso. The Brazilian Real,
Colombian Peso and Kazakhstani Tenge recovered during the year, but remain devalued as compared to the beginning of 2015, which had an
offsetting impact on our 2016 results. For additional information, refer to Item 7A.— Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Alto Maipo

During 2016, the Alto Maipo project in Chile experienced technical difficulties in construction which resulted in an increase in projected costs of

up to 22% over the original $2 billion budget. These additional costs have led to a series of negotiations with the main contractors, financiers and
partners of the project, with the intention to restructure the existing financing and obtain additional financing to guarantee project completion. On
January 19, 2017, the parties agreed on the basis of the restructuring process, including new project milestones. These agreements are subject to
the negotiation and finalization of the specific restructuring terms and conditions; and the negotiation and approval of the terms and conditions of
each of the financing documents. Currently, the Company's indirect equity interest in the project is 40%.

Impairments

Long-lived Assets — During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $1.1 billion . Due to
decreased wind production and a decline in forward power curves in 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Buffalo
Gap I, II, and III. After recognizing asset impairment expense of $236 million at Buffalo Gap I and II, the carrying value of the long-lived asset groups
at Buffalo Gap I, II, and III totaled $242 million at December 31, 2016 .

Additionally, the Company recognized an asset impairment expense of $859 million at DPL in 2016. After recognizing asset impairment

expense at DPL, the carrying value of the long-lived asset groups at DPL, including those that were not impaired, totaled $498 million at
December 31, 2016 . See Note 20 — Asset Impairment Expense in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information
regarding the impairments at Buffalo Gap and DPL.

Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may

include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased
competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely
than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

Goodwill — The Company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk." A reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fair value
is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of Step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. It is
possible that the Company may incur goodwill impairment charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes in
their business or operating environments occur. See Note 9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8.— Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for further information.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Overview — As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion , of which $100 million was

held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies. The Company also had $798 million in short term investments, held primarily at
subsidiaries. In addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $871 million . The Company also had non-recourse and recourse
aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.8 billion and $4.7 billion , respectively. Of the approximately $1.3 billion of our current non-
recourse debt, $1.2 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $128 million relates to debt considered in default
due to covenant violations. The defaults are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other
covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an
allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the
Company.

104

We expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or

through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. None of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months. From time
to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management
believes that such securities are attractively priced. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements
and other factors. The amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.

We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized

non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power
plants, distribution companies and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other
subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion or
all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches
the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is
matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt
capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.

Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When
possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition,
the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the
interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related
underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company's only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its
floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2019. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $20.5 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31,
2016 , approximately $3.5 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. Brazil
holds $1.3 billion of our floating rate non-recourse exposure as we have no ability to fix local debt interest rates efficiently.

In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances

all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments
have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We
generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from
our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial
guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment
or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent
Company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. At
December 31, 2016 , the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support
commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $535 million in aggregate
(excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).

As a result of the Parent Company's below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured
commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to
provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to
provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such
counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2016 , we had $6 million in
letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, $245 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our un-
senior secured credit facility and $3 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of our senior secured credit facility. These
letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. During the year ended
December 31, 2016 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5%  per annum on the outstanding amounts.

We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our
affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual
businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available

105

on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under
construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may
become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the
subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a
project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.

Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise

capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic
uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the
timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of
operations of our businesses.

Long-Term Receivables — As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $264 million of accounts receivable classified as
Noncurrent assets—other related to certain of its generation businesses in Argentina and the U.S. and its utility business in Brazil. The noncurrent
portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in Argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection
periods that extend beyond December 31, 2017 , or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority of Argentinian receivables have been
converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. See Note 6 — Financing Receivables included in Item 8.— Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 1.— Business — Regulatory Matters—Argentina of this Form 10-K for further information.

The following discussion of Parent Company Liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to

The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined
below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance
with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Parent Company
Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are
dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent
Company level, including availability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are
primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases;
acquisitions; taxes; Parent Company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock.

The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit
facility. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S.. Such
subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most
directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, Cash and cash equivalents , at December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

The Company paid dividends of $0.44 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 . While we intend to

continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay
dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.

Recourse Debt — Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. See Note 11

— Debt in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail.

While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of
material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties —
Global Economic Conditions ), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company
level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these
sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. See Item 1A.— Risk Factors — The
AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is
dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this Form 10-K.

Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The

covenants provide for — among other items — limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock
repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with
affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.

As of December 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level.

Non-Recourse Debt — While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent
Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:

•

•

•
•

reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of
any default;
triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on
behalf of such subsidiary;
causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company.

For example, our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain
bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of
default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.

Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt
classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $1.3 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults
was $128 million  at December 31, 2016 , all of which was non-recourse debt related to two subsidiaries — Kavarna, and Sogrinsk. See Note 11 —
Debt in Item 8.— Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional detail.

None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES' corporate debt

agreements as of December 31, 2016 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under AES' indebtedness.
However, as a result of additional dispositions of

116

assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of
operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a
"material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent
Company's outstanding debt securities. A material subsidiary is defined in the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business
that contributed 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters.
As of December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under
the recourse debt of the Company.

Includes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts exclude capital lease obligations which are included in the capital lease category.
Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2016 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances.
Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2016 .
These amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except for the current portion of uncertain tax obligations. Noncurrent uncertain tax obligations are reflected in the "Other"
column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. In addition, these amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 10 — Regulatory

As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment

that were not included in the letters of credit disclosed above.

We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks

and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of
control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated
damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an asset sale
program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will be
required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2016 , many of the events which would give rise to
such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent
contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments

and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES' significant accounting policies are described in Note  1 — General and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly
uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions
on financial condition or operating performance is material.

Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual
results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed
these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below are the Company's most significant critical accounting
estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes — We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision
requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and
other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The
Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision
for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have
been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves
are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company
believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be
materially different than the reserve amounts.

Because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical
earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. Furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax
treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent
economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As an example, new tax laws were enacted in February 2016 in Chile which
increased the statutory income tax rate for most of our Chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years.
Accordingly, in 2016 our net Chilean deferred tax liabilities were remeasured to the new rates. The remeasurement amount and other potential
future impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operations. See Note 21 — Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

The Company's provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
Since 2006, the Company has benefited from the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the TIPRA of 2005, subject
to five temporary extensions, including the most recent five year retroactive extension enacted on December 18, 2015 in the H.R.2029 -
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. There can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond December 31, 2019.
Further, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change corporate tax rates, business rules such as interest deductibility
and capital expenditure cost recovery, and U.S. international tax rules. Our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be
material to the Company should such reforms be enacted.

In addition, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-U.S.

subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement

carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Sales of Noncontrolling Interests — The accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests under the accounting standards depends on

whether the sale is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (as

118

opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. If
management's estimation process determines that there is no significant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the
noncontrolling interest is recognized in earnings. However, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate,
the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. In-substance real estate is comprised of
land plus improvements and integral equipment. The determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the
significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal),
combined with the decrease in the fair value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. When the combined total of removal costs and
the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. The
accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. Where the consolidated entity in which
noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the
assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. This
estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates
about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the
accounting standards on business combinations. As such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical
accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value.

Impairments — Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 — General and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of
goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation.

The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the

fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value
measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many
circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management
with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefit
analysis and the Company's internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying
assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow
valuation model (the "DCF model"), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived
assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to
reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.

Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash
flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth
rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input
assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption
is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often
derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on
historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of
macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the
macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a
narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly
different budgets and cash flow forecasts.

A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs

to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly
traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies
based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants
could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.

119

Fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts

and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the
impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases
as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a
different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from
uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 9 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

Note 20 — Asset Impairment Expense and Note 8 — Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K.

Fair Value

Fair Value Hierarchy — The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and

minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such
prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available
observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the
price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity.

To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair

value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. An asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is
based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more
information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1— General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in

fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term
investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative
assets, included in Other current asset s and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current)
and Other long-term liabilities . Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as
interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds.
Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate
swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial
instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note  4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities — Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and

intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the
majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant
accounting guidance. In determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions as discussed in the Impairments section
above.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our
exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures.
We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale"
transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to
derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 5 — Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification.

120

The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on

the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the
exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is
designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as
the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal
documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.

The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price

that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,
or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair
value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting
entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with
non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the
Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation
models that utilize observable market inputs.

As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to

our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make
estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our
counterparty's), and future exchange rates. Refer to Note  4 — Fair Value included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.

The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal and third party valuation models, most of which are based on

observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of
its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt's). In some cases, where market
data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a
financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and
management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign
exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of the
forward curve using relative inflation rates. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial
institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or
ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions
could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.

Regulatory Assets — Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors

such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential
deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating
income.

Consolidation — The Company has recently entered into several transactions whereby the Company sells an interest in its controlled
subsidiaries and/or equity method investments. In connection with each transaction, the Company must determine whether the sale of the interest
impacts the Company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model
or the voting model. In determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the Company is required to make judgments about how the
entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group,
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.

If the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the Company must consolidate

the entity is whether the Company, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. If AES is determined to
have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by AES.

121

Alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-AES

shareholders have substantive participating rights. The assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights
requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the
compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, establishing operating and capital decisions of
the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. On the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as
protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee.
Significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect
the evaluation of control. While both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right
relates.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — Effective January 1, 2016 the Company applied a disaggregated discount rate approach for
determining service cost and interest cost for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 —
General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Overview Regarding Market Risks — Our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure
is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. In addition, our businesses are also exposed to
lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry
and lower variable costs. We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary
level and between our functional currency, the U.S. Dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate
fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related financial instruments.

The disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall apply to the disclosures contained in this
Item 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.— Risk Factors , Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate
significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations , Our businesses may incur substantial costs and
liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial performance, and We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates of this
2016 Form 10-K.

Commodity Price Risk — Although we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels and

environmental credits, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales or under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure
on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. In our utility businesses, we may be exposed to commodity price movements
depending on our excess or shortfall of generation relative to load obligations and sharing or pass-through mechanisms. These businesses subject
our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels and environmental credits in competitive markets. We employ risk management
strategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategies
can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps and options. At our generation businesses for 2017-2019, 75% to
80% of our variable margin is hedged against changes in commodity prices. At our utility businesses for 2017-2019, 85% to 90% of our variable
margin is insulated from changes in commodity prices.

The portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly
matched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales
that lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold.

AES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2017, we project pretax earnings
exposure on a 10% move in commodity prices would be approximately $15 million for U.S. power (DPL), $5 million for natural gas, $5 million for oil
and $10 million for coal. Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas prices can be
accompanied by

122

a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs with lower oil, lower natural gas,
and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to
changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.

Commodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot power

prices, contract indexation provisions and generation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil and
coal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others.
Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these
factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies and
regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limit
downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume sold
under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spot
markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power
prices.

In the US SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to

the business drivers. IPL primarily generates energy to meet its retail customer demand however it opportunistically sells surplus economic energy
into wholesale markets at market prices. Additionally, at DPL, competitive retail markets permit our customers to select alternative energy suppliers
or elect to remain in aggregated customer pools for which energy is supplied by third party suppliers through a competitive auction process. DPL
participates in these auctions held by other utilities and sells the remainder of its economic energy into the wholesale market. Given that natural gas-
fired generators generally get energy prices for many markets, higher natural gas prices tend to expand our coal fixed margins. Our non-contracted
generation margins are impacted by many factors including the growth in natural gas-fired generation plants, new energy supply from renewable
sources, and increasing energy efficiency.

In the Andes SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in
both. In the central region, the contract sales generally cover the efficient generation from our coal-fired and hydroelectric assets. Any residual spot
price risk will primarily be driven by the amount of hydrological inflows. In the case of low hydroelectric generation, spot price exposure is capped by
the ability to dispatch our natural gas/diesel assets the price of which depends on fuel pricing at the time required. There is a small amount of coal
generation in the northern region that is not covered by the portfolio of contract sales and therefore subject to spot price risk. In both regions,
generators with oil or oil-linked fuel generally set power prices. In Colombia, we operate under a short-term sales strategy and have commodity
exposure to unhedged volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel.

In the Brazil SBU, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is
mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism
may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of
thermal generation.

In the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under a portfolio of fixed
volume contract sales. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract sales volume, the business will be sensitive to
changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil prices in some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas-fired assets
contracted under a portfolio of contract sales and a coal-fired asset contracted with a single contract, and both contract and spot prices may move
with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not always match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spot prices
in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.

In the Europe SBU, our Kilroot facility operates on a short-term sales strategy. To the extent that sales are unhedged, the commodity risk at

our Kilroot business is to the clean dark spread, which is the difference between electricity price and our coal-based variable dispatch cost including
emissions. Natural gas-fired generators set power prices for many periods, so higher natural gas prices generally expand margins and higher coal or
emissions prices reduce them. Similarly, increased wind generators displaces higher cost generation, reducing Kilroot's margins, and vice versa.

In the Asia SBU, our Masinloc business is a coal-fired generation facility which hedges its output under a portfolio of contract sales that are

indexed to fuel prices, with generation in excess of contract volume or shortfalls

123

of generation relative to contract volumes settled in the spot market. Low oil prices may be a driver of margin compression since oil affects spot
power sale prices sold in the spot market. Our Mong Duong business has minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no merchant exposure
and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk — In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks

that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar ("USD"). Additionally, certain of our
foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in the USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. We
have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine Peso, British Pound,
Brazilian Real, Chilean Peso, Colombian Peso, Dominican Peso, Euro, Indian Rupee, Kazakhstan Tenge, Mexican Peso and Philippine Peso.
These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to
changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps and options, where possible, to manage our risk related to certain
foreign currency fluctuations.

AES enters into cash flow hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES

portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to
variation of timing and amount between cash distribution and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on a
realized basis which could result in greater volatility in earnings. The largest foreign exchange risks over a 12-month forward-looking period stem
from the following currencies: Brazilian Real, Euro, Colombian Peso, British Pound, and Kazakhstan Tenge. As of December 31, 2016 , assuming a
10% USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate of the Brazilian Real and
Euro each is projected to be reduced by $5 million. Colombian Peso, Kazakhstan Tenge and British Pound - less than $5 million for 2017. These
numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10% USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2017 coming from the
respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The
numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or
existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further
modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.

The foreign exchange sensitivities included above have been calculated based on the underlying cash distribution exposures. This is different

than the prior period’s disclosure, which was based on earnings, as a result of a change in AES’ foreign exchange hedging strategy in 2016. The
table below provides a comparison of the earnings based sensitivity approached used in the 2015 Form 10-K for both FY2016 and FY2017.

Interest Rate Risks — We are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate

debt, as well as interest rate swap, cap, floor and option agreements.

Decisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on

whether a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by
arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap and floor
agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse
financings at our businesses.

As of December 31, 2016 , the portfolio's pretax earnings exposure for 2017 to a one time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our

Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Euro, Kazakhstani Tenge and USD denominated debt would be approximately $25 million on
interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between these
interest rates.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The AES Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related

consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The AES

Corporation at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its requirements for reporting discontinued operations

as a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” effective July 1, 2014. Also, the Company
changed its classification of debt issuance costs as a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 and No. 2015-15, “Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30),” effective January 1,
2016.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The AES

Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February
24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

1 . GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The AES Corporation is a holding company (the "Parent Company") that through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, "AES" or "the

Company") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, given this holding
company structure, the liabilities of the individual operating entities are non-recourse to the parent and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of
our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless
of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION — The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation

and its subsidiaries, which are the entities that it controls. Furthermore, variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company has a variable
interest have been consolidated when the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus controls the VIE. Intercompany transactions and balances
are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

DP&L, our utility in Ohio, has undivided interests in five generation facilities and numerous transmission facilities. These undivided interests in

jointly-owned facilities are accounted for on a pro-rata basis in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses, primarily fuel costs for the
generating units, are allocated to the joint owners based on their energy usage. The remaining expenses, investments in fuel inventory, plant
materials and operating supplies and capital additions are allocated to the joint owners in accordance with their respective ownership interests. See
Note 3 — Property, Plant and Equipment for additional details.

USE OF ESTIMATES — The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally

accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and
assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-
lived assets and equity method investments; valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets;
the estimation of regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business
combination; the measurement of noncontrolling interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("HLBV") method for certain renewable
generation partnerships; the determination of whether a sale of noncontrolling interests is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (as
opposed to an equity transaction); pension liabilities; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS — Effective July 1, 2014, the Company prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting discontinued Operations and
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity , which significantly changed the prior accounting guidance on discontinued operations. Under
ASU No. 2014-08, only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or a held-for-sale business that will have)
a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations. Amongst other changes: equity method
investments that were previously scoped-out of the discontinued operations accounting guidance are now included in the scope; a business can
meet the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale upon acquisition and be reported in discontinued operations; and components where an entity
retains significant continuing involvement or where operations and cash flows will not be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of a disposal
transaction can meet the definition of discontinued operations. Additionally, where summarized amounts are presented on the face of the financial
statements, reconciliations of those amounts to major classes of line items are also required. ASU No. 2014-08 requires additional disclosures for
individually material components that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08 we had classified
certain business as discontinued operations that would not meet the criteria under the current standard. See Note 23 — Dispositions for further
information.

Prior to July 1, 2014, a discontinued operation was a component of the Company that either had been disposed of or was classified as held-
for-sale and where the Company did not expect to have significant cash flows from or significant continuing involvement with the component as of
one year after its disposal or sale. A component

131

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

was comprised of operations and cash flows that could be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of
the Company.

Prior period amounts in the statement of operations are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued
operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations or held-for-sale are included within the relevant
categories within operating, investing and financing activities. The aggregate amount of cash flows is offset by the net increase or decrease in cash
of discontinued and held-for-sale businesses, which is presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

When an operation is classified as held-for-sale, the Company recognizes any impairment expense on the entire operation, which will include
an amount allocable to noncontrolling interests, at the level of the held-for-sale operation and/or at a parent entity as applicable. However, any gain
or loss on the completion of a disposal transaction is fully allocated to AES and to its noncontrolling interests at a parent entity level, given that the
operational level noncontrolling interests have been removed with deconsolidation of the disposed entity. Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale
businesses are classified as current when they are expected to be disposed of within twelve months.

RECLASSIFICATIONS — To comply with newly adopted accounting standards, certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial

statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Deferred financing costs were reclassified from the Other current assets
and Other noncurrent assets lines to the current and noncurrent Non-recourse debt lines, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the
year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, amounts relating to capitalized software were reclassified from Electric generation, distribution assets
and other line to Other intangible assets, net of amortization line on the Consolidated Balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2015. See
further detail in the new accounting pronouncements discussion.

FAIR VALUE — Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting
guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (noncurrent) ; derivative assets, included in Other current assets
and Other assets (noncurrent) ; and, derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long-term liabilities . The
Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or in conjunction with
the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group or goodwill under the accounting guidance for
the impairment of long-lived assets or goodwill.

The Company makes assumptions about what market participants would assume in valuing an asset or liability based on the best information

available. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk of the subsidiary (for liabilities)
and of the counterparty (for assets). The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in
determining fair value. The principal or most advantageous market is considered from the perspective of the subsidiary owning the asset or with the
liability.

Fair value is based on observable market prices where available. Where they are not available, specific valuation models and techniques are

applied depending on what is being fair valued. These models and techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The process involves varying levels of management judgment, the degree of which is dependent on price transparency and
complexity. An asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement,
where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. The three levels are defined as follows:

• Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible by the Company for identical assets or liabilities. Active markets are those in

which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
• Level 2 — pricing inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 which are based on observable market data, that are directly or
indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. These include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities,
quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, adjusted quoted market prices, inputs from observable data
such as interest rate and yield curves, volatilities or default rates observable at commonly quoted intervals or inputs derived from observable
market data by correlation or other means.

132

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

• Level 3 — pricing inputs that are unobservable from objective sources. Unobservable inputs are only used to the extent observable inputs aren't
available. These inputs maintain the concept of an exit price from the perspective of a market participant and reflect assumptions of other market
participants. The Company considers all market participant assumptions that are available without unreasonable cost and effort. These are given
the lowest priority and are generally used in internally developed methodologies to generate management's best estimate of the fair value when
no observable market data is available.

Any transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-
term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of such balances
approximate fair value.

RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES — These include cash balances which are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by
the subsidiary that owns the cash. The nature of restrictions includes restrictions imposed by financing agreements such as security deposits kept
as collateral, debt service reserves, maintenance reserves, contractual terms and others, as well as restrictions imposed by agreements related to
the sales of businesses or long-term PPAs.

INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES — The Company's marketable investments are primarily unsecured debentures, certificates
of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Short-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities
with original maturities in excess of three months with remaining maturities of less than one year.

Marketable debt securities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and

are carried at amortized cost. Other marketable securities that the Company does not intend to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale or
trading and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale investments are fair valued at the end of each reporting period where the unrealized gains or
losses are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of equity.

Investments classified as trading are fair valued at the end of each reporting period through the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Interest and dividends on investments are reported in interest income and other income , respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are
determined using the specific identification method.

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS — Accounts and notes receivable are carried

at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as specific evaluation of
collectability, historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence of the collectability, and records
an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts
receivable either under contractual terms or where charging interest is a customary business practice. In such cases, interest income is recognized
on an accrual basis. When the collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual
accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.

INVENTORY — Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and spare parts and supplies used to

maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and
incidental expenditures and charges incurred to bring the inventory to its existing condition or location. Costs of inventory are valued primarily using
the average cost method. Generally, the carrying amount of fuel inventory is reduced to market value if the market value of inventory has declined
and it is expected that the carrying amount of inventory, in its use in the ordinary course of business, will not be recovered through revenue earned
from the generation of power. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered
obsolete.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS — Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under capital leases and intangible assets subject

to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).

Property, plant and equipment — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renewals and

improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.

133

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

Construction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in
progress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time the
Company determines that development of a particular project is no longer probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to ongoing
risks related to successful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and
contract compliance. Construction-in-progress balances are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready
for its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction delays and income tax credits are recorded as a
reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flows from investing activities.

Depreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed primarily using the straight-line method over

the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part is
considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after the part is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset,
the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even when being held as a spare part.

The Company's Brazilian subsidiaries, which include both generation and distribution companies, operate under concession contracts. Certain
estimates are utilized to determine depreciation expense for the Brazilian subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment
and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based
on estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amounts recovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within
the scope of ASC 853— Service Concession Arrangements .

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization — Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives which range from 3  – 50  years.

The Company accounts for purchased emission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense when utilized or sold. Granted emission
allowances are valued at zero.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets — When circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group

may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation may
include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased
competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely
than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset group exceeds its fair value. The impairment expense cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long-lived assets (but subject to the carrying
amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). For regulated
assets where recovery through approved rates is probable, an impairment expense could be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset. For
other regulated assets and for non-regulated assets, impairment is recognized as an expense. When long-lived assets meet the criteria to be
classified as held-for-sale and the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, an impairment expense is
recognized for the excess up to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets; if the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the
carrying amount while the disposal group is still held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lower of the
prior expense or the subsequent excess.

SERVICE CONCESSION ASSETS — Service concession assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, in accordance with ASC

853. Service concession assets represent the cost of all infrastructure to be transferred to the public-sector entity grantors at the end of the
concession. These costs primarily represent construction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs
directly relating to construction of the service concession infrastructure. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction
delays and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to Service Concession Assets. Service concession assets are amortized and recognized
in earnings as a cost of goods sold as infrastructure construction revenue is recognized. Services provided under concession arrangements are
recognized on a straight line basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS — Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct

reduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs
related to a line-of-credit are deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in
connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS — Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not

control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The Company periodically assesses if there is an indication that the fair value of an equity method investment is less than its
carrying amount. When an indicator exists, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment expense
when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in Other non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The difference between the carrying amount and our underlying equity in the net assets of the investee are accounted for as if the investee were a
consolidated subsidiary, except that the portion that represents equity method goodwill is not reviewed for impairment like consolidated goodwill.
Upon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the AES share of the amortization
of the basis difference between each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the
investee. The amortization of the basis difference is recognized in our net equity in earnings of affiliates over the life of the asset or liability.

The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise

committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equity method accounting to the extent
that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for

impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual
impairment testing date is October first.

Goodwill — The Company evaluates goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an SBU (i.e. an operating segment as defined in

the segment reporting accounting guidance), or a component (i.e., one level below an operating segment). In determining its reporting units, the
Company starts with its management reporting structure. Operating segments are identified and then analyzed to identify components which make
up these operating segments. Two or more components are combined into a single reporting unit if they are economically similar. Assets and
liabilities are allocated to a reporting unit if the assets will be employed by or a liability relates to the operations of the reporting unit or would be
considered by a market participant in determining its fair value. Goodwill resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that are
expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business with a goodwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as they
are not reported to segment management together with other businesses and are not similar to other businesses in a segment.

Goodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the two-step test. If the Company qualitatively
determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is
unnecessary. Otherwise, goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two-step test, where the carrying amount of a reporting unit is compared to
its fair value in Step 1; if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, Step 2 is unnecessary. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair
value, this could indicate potential impairment and Step 2 of the goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and to
measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. When Step 2 is necessary, the fair value of individual assets and liabilities is
determined using valuations (which in some cases may be based in part on third party valuation reports) or other observable sources of fair value,
as appropriate. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss up to the carrying
amount of the goodwill.

Most of the Company's reporting units are not publicly traded. Therefore, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using

internal budgets and forecasts, adjusted for any market participants' assumptions and discounted at the rate of return required by a market
participant. The Company generally considers both market and income-based approaches to determine a range of fair value, but typically concludes
that the value derived using an income-based approach is more representative of fair value due to the lack of direct market comparables. The

135

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

Company utilizes market data, when available, to corroborate and determine the reasonableness of the fair value derived from the income-based
discounted cash flow analysis.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights. These

are tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. If the
carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense. When deemed appropriate, the
Company uses the qualitative assessment option under the accounting guidance on goodwill and intangible assets to determine whether the
existence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of
events and circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired, no further action is taken.
The accounting guidance provides the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to
performing the quantitative impairment test.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES — Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the

Company's core business operations. These payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for
resale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. Other accrued liabilities include items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal
contingencies and employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and related taxes.

REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES — The Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process
that are not recognized under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred due to
the future recovery in customer rates being probable. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations within Interest Income . Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers. Management continually
assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory of liabilities are probable of future payment by considering
factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential
deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off and
recognized in income from continuing operations.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS — The Company recognizes in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset or liability

reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL,
except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations
through future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measurement date provisions of the accounting guidance, which
require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations for all defined benefit plans.

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company applied a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its

defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. This approach is consistent with the requirements of ASC 715—
Compensation—Retirement Benefits and is considered to be more precise compared to the aggregated single rate discount approach, which has
historically been used in the U.S. and U.K., because it is more consistent with the philosophy of a full yield curve valuation. The disaggregated rate
approach can be applied only in countries with a sufficiently robust yield curve. For countries other than the U.S. and U.K., the Company will
continue to apply a local government bond yield approach.

The change in discount rate approach in the U.S. and U.K. did not have an impact on the measurement of the benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2015. The 2016 service costs and interest costs included in Note 14 — Benefit Plans reflect the change in estimate described above.
The impact of the change in approach on service costs for the U.S. and U.K. plans in 2016 is shown below (in millions):

INCOME TAXES — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the

financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities,

136

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under a more likely than not recognition threshold and
measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting.

Uncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company's
policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income
taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS — The Company records the fair value of the liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the
period in which the obligation is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over
the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may
incur a gain or loss.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS — Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance

Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling
interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is
accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests (unless the transaction qualifies as a sale of in-substance
real estate). Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.

Although, in general, the noncontrolling ownership interest in earnings is calculated based on ownership percentage, certain of the Company's
businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements. These agreements exist for certain renewable generation partnerships to designate different
allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the
Company uses the HLBV method when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. HLBV uses a balance sheet approach,
which measures the Company's share of income or loss by calculating the change in the amount of net worth the partners are legally able to claim
based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the beginning of a reporting period compared to the end of that period.

Equity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified outside of permanent equity.
Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument is
probable of becoming redeemable.  Where the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable subsequent allocation of income and
dividends is classified in permanent equity. For those securities where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable or that are currently
redeemable, AES recognizes changes in the fair value at each accounting period against retained earnings subject to the floor of the initial fair
value. Further, the allocation of income and dividends, as well as the adjustment to fair value, is classified outside permanent equity. Amounts that
are mandatory redeemable are classified as a liability.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the

business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional
currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the
end of the fiscal period. Translation adjustments arising from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. The
revenue and expense accounts of such subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed
during the period. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does not
intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation
adjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the
investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are included in carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company has
committed to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings.

137

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue from

the sale of energy is recognized in the period during which the sale occurs. The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on the
number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated average price per customer
class for that month. Differences between actual and estimated unbilled revenue are usually immaterial. The Company has businesses where it sells
and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. In those instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because
the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated and is recognized based upon
output delivered and capacity provided, at rates as specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates. Certain of the Company PPAs meet
the definition of an operating lease or contain similar arrangements. Typically, minimum lease payments from such PPAs are recognized as revenue
on a straight-line basis over the lease term whereas contingent rentals are recognized when earned. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes
assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, and

performance stock units. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to
estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES — General and administrative expenses include corporate and other expenses related to

corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, which are not
directly allocable to our business segments. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general
and administrative expenses.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES — Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all

contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See the Company's fair value policy and Note 4— Fair
Value for additional discussion regarding the determination of the fair value. The PPAs and fuel supply agreements entered into by the Company are
evaluated to determine if they meet the definition of a derivative or contain embedded derivatives, either of which require separate valuation and
accounting. To be a derivative under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, an agreement would need to have a notional and an
underlying, require little or no initial net investment and could be net settled. Generally, these agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative,
often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for the commodities to be delivered under these
agreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the agreements could then be net settled and meet the definition of a
derivative.

Derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity derivatives. The

Company enters into various derivative transactions in order to hedge its exposure to certain market risks, primarily interest rate, foreign currency
and commodity price risks. Regarding interest rate risk, the Company and our subsidiaries generally utilize variable rate debt financing for
construction projects and operations so interest rate swap, lock, cap, and floor agreements are entered into to manage interest rate risk by
effectively fixing or limiting the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing and are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Regarding
foreign currency risk, we are exposed to it as a result of our investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that may be impacted by significant
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so foreign currency options and forwards are utilized, where deemed appropriate, to manage the risk
related to these fluctuations. Cross-currency swaps are utilized in certain instances to manage the risk related to certain foreign currencies and the
associated impact on interest and loan principal payments. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have entered into contracts which contain
embedded foreign currency derivatives as a result of the contracts being denominated in a currency other than the functional or local currency of the
parties to the contract. Regarding commodity price risk, we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuel and
environmental credits. Although we primarily consist of businesses with long-term contracts or retail sales concessions (which provide our
distribution businesses with a franchise to serve a specific geographic region), a portion of our current and expected future revenues are derived
from businesses without significant long-term purchase or sales contracts. We use an overall hedging strategy, not just derivatives, to hedge our
financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in commodity prices.

138

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on

the exposure being hedged. The Company only has cash flow hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective,
designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings.
Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all designated and qualifying hedges, the Company maintains formal documentation
of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. If AES determines that the
derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted
transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the probability of the occurrence and timing of such
transactions. Changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect the
timing of the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges from AOCL into earnings.

While derivative transactions are not entered into for trading purposes, some contracts are either not eligible or not designated for hedge
accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.
Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives (including all those where the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3) are recognized in
earnings, they are generally classified as follows: interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction
gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives.
However, gains and losses on interest rate and cross-currency derivatives are classified as foreign currency transaction gains and losses if they
offset the remeasurement of the foreign currency-denominated debt being hedged by the cross-currency swaps. If the underlying hedged item is
construction debt, the effective portion of the realized swap payment related to capitalized interest is deferred in AOCL, then reclassified to cost of
sales to offset depreciation expense over the useful life of the associated asset. Any foreign currency remeasurement effects in earnings of the
foreign currency denominated debt is offset by a reclassification from AOCL. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant
financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an
investing activity.

The Company has elected not to offset net derivative positions in the financial statements. Accordingly, the Company does not offset such

derivative positions against the fair value of amounts (or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a
receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.

period when the awards vest or are
settled, rather than in paid-in-capital in
the period when the excess tax
benefits are realized. Upon adoption,
the change will result in a decrease of
approximately $30 million to net
deferred tax liabilities, offset by an
increase to retained earnings. We will
continue to estimate the number of
awards that are expected to vest in our
determination of the related periodic
compensation cost.

The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting the standard on
its consolidated financial statements.
The Company intends to adopt the
standard as of January 1, 2019.

January 1,
2018. Earlier
application is
permitted only
as of January
1, 2017.

The Company will adopt the standard
on January 1, 2018; see below for the
evaluation of the impact of its adoption
on the consolidated financial
statements.

ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent corresponding updates provides the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognize revenue. The

core principle is that an entity shall recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Amendments to the standard were issued that
provide further clarification of the principle and to provide certain transition expedients. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition
guidance in GAAP, including the guidance on recognizing other income upon the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets (including in-substance real
estate).

The standard requires retrospective application and allows either a full retrospective adoption in which all of the periods are presented under
the new standard or a modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance is recognized at the date of
initial application. We are currently working towards adopting the standard using the full retrospective method. However, the company will continue
to assess this conclusion which is dependent on the final impact to the financial statements.

In 2016, the company established a cross-functional implementation team and is in the process of evaluating changes to our business

processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. At this time, we do not expect any significant impact
on our financial systems as a result of the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard.

Given the complexity and diversity of our non-regulated arrangements, the Company is assessing the standard on a contract by contract basis
and has completed more than half of the total expected effort. Through this assessment, the Company has identified certain key issues that we are
continuing to evaluate in order to complete our assessment of the full population of contracts and be able to assess the overall impact to the
financial statements. These issues include: the application of the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance
obligation, when variable quantities would be considered variable consideration versus an option to acquire additional goods and services, how to
measure progress toward completion for a performance obligation that is a bundle and application of the standard to contracts that are under the
scope of Service Concession Arrangements (Topic 853). We are continuing to work with various non-authoritative industry groups, and monitoring
the FASB and Transition Resource Group (TRG) activity, as we finalize our accounting policy on these and other industry specific interpretative
issues which is expected in 2017.

The fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts.

The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. By virtue of these
amounts being estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Valuation Techniques — The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of

assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant
information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation
techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return on
those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company measures its
investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain
nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plant
and equipment), goodwill and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determines
the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements
of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the
most representative of fair value.

Investments — The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities
are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices, which are considered Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy, or measured
at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets, which are considered Level 2 measurements in the fair value
hierarchy. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures, certificates of deposit and government debt securities held by our Brazilian
subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally indexed to the CDI rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value
based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets and are considered Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.

Derivatives — Any Level 1 derivative instruments are exchange-traded commodity futures for which the pricing is observable in active markets,

and as such, these are not expected to transfer to other levels. There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.

For all derivatives, with the exception of any classified as Level 1, the income approach is used, which consists of forecasting future cash flows

based on contractual notional amounts and applicable and available market data as of the valuation date. The most common market data inputs
used in the income approach include volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates
and commodity prices. Forward rates with the same tenor as the derivative instrument being valued are generally obtained from published sources,
with these forward rates being assessed quarterly at a portfolio-level for reasonableness versus comparable published information provided from
another source. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression
analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

For derivatives for which there is a standard industry valuation model, the Company uses a third-party derivative accounting and valuation

service provider that uses a standard model and observable inputs to estimate the fair value. For these derivatives, the Company performs
analytical procedures and makes comparisons to other third-party information in order to assess the reasonableness of the fair value. For
derivatives for which there is not a standard industry valuation model (such as PPAs and fuel supply agreements that are derivatives or include
embedded derivatives), the Company has created internal valuation models to estimate the fair value, using observable data to the extent available.
At each quarter-end, the models for the commodity and foreign currency-based derivatives are generally prepared and reviewed by employees who
globally manage the respective commodity and foreign currency risks and are analytically reviewed independent of those employees.

Those cash flows are then discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate (such as LIBOR or EURIBOR). The Company then
makes a credit valuation adjustment ("CVA") by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or
estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential
future scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as
available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is a liability is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current
debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating (based on
applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant information) and spreads of comparably
rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to
unique risk exposures.

The Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published
forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the
curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices.
Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the Company utilizes the
purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. In addition, in certain
instances, there may not be market or market-corroborated data readily available, requiring the use of unobservable inputs. Similarly, in certain
instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable requiring us to utilize proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.
The fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is considered
significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant.
When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 are
determined as of the end of the reporting period and result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.

Debt — Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated differently based upon the type of loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt
is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow ("DCF")
analyses. In the DCF analysis, the discount rate is based on the credit rating of the individual debt instruments, if available, or the credit rating of the
subsidiary. If the subsidiary's credit rating is not available, a synthetic credit rating is determined using certain key metrics, including cash flow ratios
and interest coverage, as well as other industry-specific factors. For subsidiaries located outside the U.S., in the event that the country rating is
lower than the credit rating previously determined, the country rating is used for purposes of the DCF analysis. The fair value of recourse and non-
recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31,
2016 . The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2016 .

Nonrecurring Measurements — For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is determined using valuation
models based on the principles of DCF. The income approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity
method investments, goodwill, and intangible assets. The Company uses its internally developed DCF valuation models as the primary means to
determine nonrecurring fair value measurements though other valuation approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting
guidance are also considered. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in
the valuation process. A few examples of input assumptions to such valuations include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry
demand, inflation, exchange rates and

144

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

power and commodity prices. Whenever possible, the Company attempts to obtain market observable data to develop input assumptions. Where
the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain input assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a variety
of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations.

For nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar assets

are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This
approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the
income approach.

For nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. Under this

approach, the depreciated replacement cost of assets is derived by first estimating the current replacement cost of assets and then applying the
remaining useful life percentages to such costs. Further adjustments for economic and functional obsolescence are made to the depreciated
replacement cost. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived
tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.

Fair Value Considerations — In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the
instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used
to assess these factors are:

Sources of market assumptions — The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg

and Reuters). To determine fair value, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical
evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.

Market liquidity — The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is
traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market
bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume and the
market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly
affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of
government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction.

Nonperformance risk — Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a liability is
transferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited to, the Company or its counterparty's credit and settlement risk.
Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available and the nature of
master netting arrangements. The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various interest rate swaps and options; foreign currency options and
forwards; and derivatives and embedded derivatives, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The financial and physical instruments
held at the subsidiary level are generally non-recourse to the Parent Company.

Nonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is incorporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark the

investments to fair value.

Recurring Measurements — The following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1— General and

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
the dates indicated (in millions). For the Company's investments in marketable debt and equity securities, the security classes presented are
determined based on the nature and risk of the security and are consistent with how the Company manages, monitors and measures its marketable
securities:

Changes in the above significant unobservable inputs that lead to a significant and unusual impact to current-period earnings are disclosed to

the Financial Audit Committee. For interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency derivatives, increases (decreases) in the estimates of the
Company's own credit spreads would decrease (increase) the value of the derivatives in a liability position. For foreign currency derivatives,
increases (decreases) in the estimate of the above exchange rate would increase (decrease) the value of the derivative.

Nonrecurring Measurements

When evaluating impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, discontinued operations, and equity method investments, the Company measures

fair value using the applicable fair value measurement guidance. Impairment expense is measured by comparing the fair value at the evaluation
date to their then-latest available carrying amount. The following table summarizes major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

Argentina — Collection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties including, but not
limited to, the operation of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and
amount of collections, and economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine
government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once the
recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but are
inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates.

FONINVEMEM Agreements

As a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argentine government, referred
to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of combined cycle
and gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plant begins
operations. In addition, AES Argentina receives an ownership interest in these newly built plants once the receivables have been fully repaid.

FONINVEMEM I and II — The receivables under the first two FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants

commenced operations in 2010. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers how timely
the collections have historically been made in accordance with the agreements.

FONINVEMEM III — The receivables related to the third FONINVEMEM Agreement have been actively collected since the related plants
commenced operations in 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under this agreement, the Company also considers how timely the
collections have historically been made in accordance with the agreements.

The FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to U.S. dollars, which represents a foreign currency
derivative. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM
financing receivables that were excluded from the table above had a fair value of $255 million and $292 million , respectively.

Other Agreements

In 2013, Resolution No. 95/2013 ("Resolution 95") which developed a new energy regulatory framework that applies to all generation
companies with certain exceptions became effective. The new regulatory framework reimburses fixed and variable costs plus a margin that will
depend on the technology and fuel used to generate the electricity and the installed capacity of each plant.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Argentine government passed a resolution to contribute outstanding Resolution 95 receivables into a trust

whereby AES Argentina has committed to install additional capacity into the system. CAMMESA will finance the investment utilizing the outstanding
receivables as a guarantee.

On July 10, 2015, the Argentine government passed Resolution No. 482/2015 ("Resolution 482") which updated the prices of Resolution

529/2014 retroactively to February 1, 2015, and created a new trust called FONINVEMEM 2015-2018 in order to invest in new generation plants.
AES Argentina and certain Termoandes units will receive compensation under this program.

(2)   The Company's ownership in Guacolda is held through AES Gener, a 67% -owned consolidated subsidiary. AES Gener owns 50% of Guacolda, resulting in an AES effective ownership in Guacolda of 33% .
(3)   OPGC has one coal-fired project under development which is an expansion of our existing OPGC business. The project started construction in April 2014 and is expected to begin operations in 2018.

Guacolda — On September 1, 2015, AES Gener and Global Infrastructure Partners ("GIP") executed a restructuring of Guacolda that

increased Guacolda's tax basis in certain long-term assets and AES Gener's equity investment. As a result, AES Gener recorded $66 million in net
equity in earnings of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which $46 million is attributable to The AES Corporation.

On April 11, 2014, AES Gener undertook a series of transactions, pursuant to which AES Gener acquired the interests that it did not previously

own in Guacolda for $728 million and simultaneously sold the ownership interest to GIP for $730 million . The transaction provided GIP with
substantive participating rights in Guacolda and, as a result, the Company continues to account for its investment in Guacolda using the equity
method of accounting. At no time during this transaction did the Company acquire a non-controlling interest. The cash paid for the acquisition is
reflected in Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and the cash proceeds from the sale of these ownership interests to GIP is reflected in Proceeds from
the sale of businesses, net of cash sold, and equity method investments on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended
December 31, 2014.

Silver Ridge Power — On July 2, 2014, the Company closed the sale of its 50% ownership interest in Silver Ridge Power, LLC ("SRP") for a

purchase price of $179 million , excluding the Company's indirect ownership interests in SRP's solar generation businesses in Italy and Spain
("Solar Italy" and "Solar Spain," respectively). As part of the sale, the buyer had an option to purchase Solar Italy for additional consideration of $42
million by August 2015. The buyer exercised its option to purchase Solar Italy on August 31, 2015, and the sale was completed on October 1, 2015.
On September 24, 2015, the Company completed the sale of Solar Spain. Net proceeds from the sale transaction were $31 million and the
Company recognized a pretax gain on sale of less than $1 million . Upon the completion of the Solar Spain and Solar Italy sale transactions noted
above, the Company ceased its involvement in SRP's business operations and accounted for these transactions as sales of real estate.

AES Barry Ltd. — The Company holds a 100% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd. ("Barry"), a dormant entity in the U.K. that disposed of its

generation and other operating assets. Due to a debt agreement, no material financial or operating decisions can be made without the banks'
consent, and the Company does not control Barry. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , other long-term liabilities included $41 million and $49
million related to this debt agreement.

Elsta — In 2014, long lived assets within Elsta were determined to not be recoverable and an impairment charge of approximately $82 million

was recognized. The Company recognized its 50% share, or $41 million , through its proportion of the equity earnings in Elsta.

Entek — During 2014, the Company executed an agreement to sell its 49.62% interest in Entek, an investment accounted for under the equity
method, for $125 million . Entek consists of natural gas and hydroelectric generation facilities, plus a coal-fired development project. The Company

impairment expense of $86 million . The sale of the Company's interest in Entek closed on December 18, 2014.

Silver Ridge — During 2014, the Company determined that there was a decline in the fair value of its equity method investment in Silver Ridge

Power, LLC ("SRP") that was other-than-temporary based on indications about the fair value of the projects in Italy and Spain that resulted from
actual and proposed changes to tariffs. Accordingly, the Company recognized pretax impairment expense of $42 million . The transaction related to
our 50% ownership interest in SRP closed on July 2, 2014 for $179 million . See Note 7 — Investments in and Advances to Affiliates of this Form

DP&L — During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test at its DP&L reporting unit and

recognized a goodwill impairment expense of  $317 million . The reporting unit failed Step 1 as its fair value was less than its carrying amount, which
was primarily due to a decrease in forecasted dark spreads that were driven by decreases in projected forward power prices, and lower than
expected revenues from a

152

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

new CP product. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The
significant assumptions included within the discounted cash flow valuation model were forward commodity price curves, the amount of non-
bypassable charges from the pending ESP, expected revenues from the new CP product, and planned environmental expenditures. In Step 2,
goodwill was determined to have an implied negative fair value after the hypothetical purchase price allocation under the accounting guidance for
business combinations; therefore, a full impairment of the remaining goodwill balance of $317 million was recognized. DP&L is reported in the US
SBU reportable segment.

Distributed Energy — During the first quarter of 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Main Street

Power Company, Inc (subsequently renamed Distributed Energy). The transaction included recognition of $16 million of goodwill and is reported in
the US SBU reportable segment. See Note 24 — Acquisitions for additional information.

Our regulatory assets primarily consist of costs that are generally non-controllable, such as purchased electricity, energy transmission, the
difference between actual fuel costs and the fuel costs recovered in the tariffs, and other sector costs. These costs are recoverable or refundable as
defined by the laws and regulations in our various markets. Our regulatory assets also include defined pension and postretirement benefit
obligations equal to the previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior services costs that are expected to be recovered through
future rates. Other current and noncurrent regulatory assets primarily consist of:

• Unamortized carrying charges, certain environmental costs, and demand charges at IPL and DPL.

• Unamortized premiums reacquired or redeemed on long term debt at IPL and DPL, which are amortized over the lives of the original issuances.

• Unrecovered fuel and purchased power costs at IPL and DPL.

Other current regulatory assets that did not earn a rate of return were $34 million and $8 million , as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 ,

respectively. Other noncurrent regulatory assets that did not earn a rate of return were $138 million and $237 million , as of December 31, 2016 and
2015 , respectively.

Our regulatory liabilities primarily consist of obligations for removal costs which do not have an associated

legal retirement obligation, as well as obligations established by ANEEL in Brazil associated with electric utility concessions and represent amounts
received from customers or donations not subject to return. These donations are allocated to support energy network expansion and to improve
utility operations to meet customers' needs. The term of the obligation is established by ANEEL and settlement will occur when the electric utility
concessions end.

Other current and noncurrent regulatory liabilities primarily consist of amounts related to rider over collection at DPL and liabilities owed to
electricity generators due to variance in energy prices during rationing periods known as "Free Energy" at Eletropaulo. Our Brazilian subsidiaries are
authorized to refund this cost associated with monthly energy price variances between the wholesale energy market prices owed to the power
generation plants producing Free Energy and the capped price reimbursed by the local distribution companies which are passed through to the final
customers through energy tariffs.

In the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets the current regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded in Other current assets and
Accrued and other liabilities , respectively, and the noncurrent regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded in Other noncurrent assets and Other
noncurrent liabilities , respectively. The following table summarizes regulatory assets and liabilities by reportable segment in millions as of the

(1)   The interest rate on variable rate debt represents the total of a variable component that is based on changes in an interest rate index and of a fixed component. The Company has interest rate swaps and
option agreements in an aggregate notional principal amount of approximately $3.6 billion on non-recourse debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 . These agreements economically fix the variable
component of the interest rates on the portion of the variable-rate debt being hedged so that the total interest rate on that debt has been fixed at rates ranging from approximately 1.99% to 8.25% . The debt
agreements expire at various dates from 2017 through 2073 .
Multilateral loans include loans funded and guaranteed by bilaterals, multilaterals, development banks and other similar institutions.

billion of committed but unused credit facilities available to fund construction and other related costs. Excluding these facilities under construction,
AES subsidiaries had approximately $2.3 billion in a number of available but unused committed credit lines to support their working capital, debt
service reserves and other business needs. These credit lines can be used for borrowings, letters of credit, or a combination of these uses.

Non-Recourse Debt Covenants, Restrictions and Defaults — The terms of the Company's non-recourse debt include certain financial and non-

financial covenants. These covenants are limited to subsidiary activity and vary among the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are not
limited to, maintenance of certain reserves and financial ratios, minimum levels of working capital and limitations on incurring additional
indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , approximately $535 million and $513 million , respectively, of restricted cash was maintained in

accordance with certain covenants of the non-recourse debt agreements, and these amounts were included within Restricted cash and Debt service
reserves and other deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Various lender and governmental provisions restrict the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to transfer their net assets to the Parent

Company. Such restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2016 .

The following table summarizes the Company's subsidiary non-recourse debt in default (in millions) as of December 31, 2016 . Due to the

defaults, these amounts are included in the current portion of non-recourse debt:

As of December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults are payment defaults. All of the subsidiary non-recourse defaults were triggered by failure to

comply with other covenants and/or conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other
milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt
documents of the applicable subsidiary.

In the event that there is a default, bankruptcy or maturity acceleration at a subsidiary or group of subsidiaries that meets the applicable

definition of materiality under the corporate debt agreements of The AES Corporation, there could be a cross-default to the Company's recourse
debt. Materiality is defined in the Parent's senior secured credit facility as having provided 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash
distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2016 , none of the defaults listed above
individually or in the aggregate result in or are at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. In the event the
Parent Company is not in compliance with the financial covenants of its senior secured revolving credit facility, restricted payments will be limited to
regular quarterly shareholder dividends at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults would preclude the making of any
restricted payments.

In July 2016, the Company redeemed in full the $181 million balance of its 8.0% outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2017. As a result, the

Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16 million that is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In May 2016, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2026. The Company used these
proceeds to redeem, at par, $495 million aggregate principal of its existing LIBOR + 3.00% senior unsecured notes due 2019. As a result of the
latter transaction, the Company recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $4 million that is included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

In January 2016, the Company redeemed $125 million of its senior unsecured notes outstanding. The repayment included a portion of the
7.375% senior notes due in 2021, the 4.875% senior notes due in 2023, the 5.5% senior notes due in 2024, the 5.5% senior notes due in 2025 and
the floating rate senior notes due in 2019. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $7
million that is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In April 2015, the Company issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due 2025. Concurrent with this offering, the
Company redeemed via tender offers $344 million aggregate principal of its existing 8.00% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and $156 million of its
existing 8.00% senior unsecured notes due 2020. As a result of the latter transaction, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of
$82 million that is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In March 2015, the Company redeemed in full the $151 million balance of its 7.75% senior unsecured notes due October 2015 and the $164

million balance of its 9.75% senior unsecured notes due April 2016. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on
extinguishment of debt of $23 million that is included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Recourse Debt Covenants and Guarantees — The Company's obligations under the senior secured credit facility are subject to certain
exceptions, secured by (i) all of the capital stock of domestic subsidiaries owned directly by the Company and 65% of the capital stock of certain
foreign subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by the Company; and (ii) certain intercompany receivables, certain intercompany notes and certain
intercompany tax sharing agreements.

The senior secured credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, including the sale of certain assets. In such

a situation, the net cash proceeds from the sale must be applied pro rata to repay

157

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the term loan, if any, using 60% of net cash proceeds, reduced to 50% when and if the parent's recourse debt to cash flow ratio is less than  5:1 .
The lenders have the option to waive their pro rata redemption.

The senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in certain activities,
including, but not limited to, limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on restricted payments such as
shareholder dividends and equity repurchases; restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-
balance sheet or derivative arrangements; and other financial reporting requirements.

The senior secured credit facility also contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios including a cash

flow to interest coverage ratio, calculated quarterly, which provides that a minimum ratio of the Company's adjusted operating cash flow to the
Company's interest charges related to recourse debt of 1.3 times must be maintained at all times and a recourse debt to cash flow ratio, calculated
quarterly, which provides that the ratio of the Company's total recourse debt to the Company's adjusted operating cash flow must not exceed a
maximum of 7.5 times.

The terms of the Company's senior unsecured notes and senior secured credit facility contain certain covenants including, without limitation,

limitation on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.

TERM CONVERTIBLE TRUST SECURITIES — In 1999, AES Trust III, a wholly-owned special purpose business trust and a VIE, issued

approximately 10.35 million of $50 par value TECONS with a quarterly coupon payment of $0.844 for total proceeds of $517 million and concurrently
purchased $517 million of 6.75%  Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2029 (the "6.75% Debentures") issued by AES. The Company
consolidates AES Trust III in its consolidated financial statements and classifies the TECONS as recourse debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company's obligations under the 6.75%  Debentures and other relevant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the TECON Trusts' obligations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the sole assets of AES Trust III are the 6.75%
 Debentures.

AES, at its option, can redeem the 6.75%  Debentures which would result in the required redemption of the TECONS issued by AES Trust III,

currently for $50 per TECON. The TECONS must be redeemed upon maturity of the 6.75%  Debentures. The TECONS are convertible into the
common stock of AES at each holder's option prior to October 15, 2029 at the rate of 1.4216 , representing a conversion price of $35.17 per share.
The maximum number of shares of common stock AES would be required to issue should all holders decide to convert their securities would be
14.7 million shares.

Dividends on the TECONS are payable quarterly at an annual rate of 6.75% . The Trust is permitted to defer payment of dividends for up to 20

 consecutive quarters, provided that the Company has exercised its right to defer interest payments under the corresponding debentures or notes.
During such deferral periods, dividends on the TECONS would accumulate quarterly and accrue interest, and the Company may not declare or pay
dividends on its common stock. AES has not exercised the option to defer any dividends at this time and all dividends due under the Trust have
been paid.

12 . COMMITMENTS

LEASES — The Company and its subsidiaries enter into long-term non-cancelable lease arrangements which, for accounting purposes, are
classified as either an operating lease or capital lease. Operating leases primarily include certain transmission lines, office rental and site leases.
Operating lease rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 was $80 million , $59 million and $48 million ,
respectively. Capital leases primarily include transmission lines at our subsidiaries in Brazil, vehicles, and office and other operating equipment.
Capital leases are recognized in Property, Plant and Equipment within Electric generation, distribution assets and other . The gross value of the
capital lease assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $91 million and $67 million , respectively. The following table shows the future
minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases for continuing operations together with the present value of the net minimum lease
payments under capital leases as of December 31, 2016 for 2017 through 2021 and thereafter (in millions):

CONTRACTS — The Company's operating subsidiaries enter into long-term contracts for construction projects, maintenance and service,

transmission of electricity, operations services and purchase of electricity and fuel. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or
prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances. Electricity purchase contracts primarily include energy auction agreements at our Brazil
subsidiaries with extended terms through 2028. The following table shows the future minimum commitments for continuing operations under these
contracts as of December 31, 2016 for 2017 through 2021 and thereafter as well as actual purchases under these contracts for the years ended

Guarantees, Letters of Credit — In connection with certain project financings, acquisitions and dispositions, power purchases and other
agreements, the Parent Company has expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be
terminated upon the occurrence of future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has entered into various agreements,
mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. These
agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, thereby
facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to future
performance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill within the normal course of business. The expiration dates of these
guarantees vary from less than one year to more than 18 years.

The following table summarizes the Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 . Amounts presented in the

following table represent the Parent Company's current undiscounted exposure to guarantees and the range of maximum undiscounted potential
exposure. The maximum exposure is not reduced by the amounts, if any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions
in the guarantees. The were no obligations made by the Parent Company for the direct benefit of the lenders associated with the non-recourse debt
of its businesses.

(1)   Excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.

As of December 31, 2016 , the Parent Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related

equipment that were not included in the letters of credit discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company paid letter of
credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5%  per annum on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit.

Environmental — The Company periodically reviews its obligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including site
restoration and remediation. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company had recognized liabilities of $12 million and $10 million , respectively,
for projected environmental remediation costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future
costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, it
is reasonably possible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but
could not be estimated as of December 31, 2016 . In aggregate, the Company estimates that the range of potential losses related to environmental
matters, where estimable, to be up to $19 million . The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussed
above.

Litigation — The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accrues
for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has
evaluated claims in accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies that it deems both probable and reasonably estimable and,
accordingly, has recorded aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $179 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . These amounts are
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities . A significant portion of these
accrued liabilities relate to employment, non-income tax and customer disputes in international jurisdictions (principally Brazil). Certain of the
Company's subsidiaries, principally in Brazil, are defendants in a number of labor and employment lawsuits. The complaints generally seek
unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or other relief. The subsidiaries have denied any liability and intend to vigorously defend
themselves in all of these proceedings. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future
claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.

Where no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and
could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31,
2016 . The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible primarily include claims under financing agreements; disputes with offtakers,
suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged violation of monopoly laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and
regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates that the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible
material contingencies to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion . The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued, as
discussed above. These material contingencies do not include income tax-related contingencies which are considered part of our uncertain tax
positions.

Regulatory — During 2013, the Company recognized a regulatory liability of $269 million for a contingency related to an administrative ruling
which required Eletropaulo to refund customers' amounts related to the regulatory asset base. In 2014, Eletropaulo started refunding customers as
part of the tariff. In January 2015, ANEEL updated the tariff to exclude any further customer refunds. On June 30, 2015, ANEEL included in the tariff
reset the reimbursement to Eletropaulo of these amounts previously refunded to customers to begin in July 2015. During 2015, as a result of
favorable events, management reassessed the contingency and determined that it no longer meets the recognition criteria under ASC 450 —
Contingencies . Management believes that it is now only reasonably possible that Eletropaulo will have to refund these amounts to customers.
Accordingly, the Company reversed the

remaining regulatory liability for this contingency of $161 million in 2015, which increased Regulated Revenue by $97 million and reduced Interest
Expense by $64 million . Amounts related to this case are now included as part of our reasonably possible contingent range mentioned in the
preceding paragraph.

14 . BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Contribution Plan — The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans ("the Plans"). Two are for U.S. non-union employees, of
which one is for employees of the Parent Company and certain U.S. SBU businesses and one is for DPL employees. One plan includes both union
and non-union employees at IPL. One defined contribution plan is for union employees at DPL. The Plans are qualified under section 401 of the
Internal Revenue Code. All U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate Plan except for those employees who are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee
under a Plan. The Plans provide matching contributions in AES common stock or cash, other contributions at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors in AES common stock or cash and discretionary tax deferred contributions from the participants. Participants
are fully vested in their own contributions and the Company's matching contributions. Participants vest in other company contributions ratably over a
five -year period ending on the fifth anniversary of their hire date. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company's contributions to the
defined contribution plans were approximately $15 million , and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , contributions were $18 million
and $22 million per year, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plans — Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective

employees. Pension benefits are based on years of credited service, age of the participant and average earnings. Of the 33 active defined benefit
plans as of December 31, 2016 , 5 are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries  .

The Company establishes its estimated long-term return on plan assets considering various factors, which include the targeted asset allocation

percentages, historic returns and expected future returns.

The measurement of pension obligations, costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These assumptions include estimates

of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events
such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.

The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates; salary growth; retirement rates;

inflation; expected return on plan assets; and mortality rates.

The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore,

generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods.

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company applied a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its

defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in the U.S. and U.K. Refer to Note 1 — General and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies for further information relating to this change in estimate.

Sensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return on

plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2016 .
They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual
sensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2016 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2016 is
affected by the December 31, 2015 assumptions. The impact on pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is
shown in the following table (in millions):

Increase of 1% in the discount rate

Decrease of 1% in the discount rate

Increase of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets

The U.S. plans seek to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:

• maintenance of sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits and other lump sum payments;
•
•
•

long-term rate of return in excess of the annualized inflation rate;
long-term rate of return, net of relevant fees, that meets or exceeds the assumed actuarial rate; and
long-term competitive rate of return on investments, net of expenses, that equals or exceeds various benchmark rates.

The asset allocation is reviewed periodically to determine a suitable asset allocation which seeks to manage risk through portfolio

diversification and takes into account, among other possible factors, the above-stated objectives, in conjunction with current funding levels, cash
flow conditions and economic and industry trends. The following table summarizes the Company's U.S. plan assets by category of investment and

Equity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests

Jordan — In February 2016, the Company completed the sale of 40% of its interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary in Jordan that owns a
controlling interest in the Jordan IPP4 gas-fired plant for $21 million . The transaction was accounted for as a sale of in-substance real estate and a
pretax gain of $4 million , net of transaction costs, was recognized in net income. The cash proceeds from the sale are reflected in Proceeds from
the sale of businesses, net of cash sold on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended December 31, 2016 . After completion of
the sale, the Company has a 36% economic interest in Jordan IPP4 and will continue to manage and operate the plant, with 40% owned by Mitsui
Ltd. and 24% owned by Nebras Power Q.S.C. As the Company maintained control after the sale, Jordan IPP4 continues to be consolidated by the
Company within the Europe SBU reportable segment.

Brazil Reorganization — In 2015, the Company completed a restructuring of Tietê. This transaction resulted in no change of ownership or

control. The $27 million impact of this equity transaction was recognized in additional paid-in capital.

Gener — In November 2015, the Company sold a 4% stake in AES Gener S.A. ("Gener") through its 99.9% owned subsidiary Inversiones
Cachagua S.p.A ("Cachagua") for $145 million , net of transaction costs. The sale was of previously issued common shares of Gener to certain
institutional investors and is not a sale of in-substance real estate. While the sale decreased Parent ownership interest from 70.7% to 66.7% , the
Parent continues to retain its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. The difference of $24 million between the fair value of the consideration
received, net of taxes and transaction costs, and the amount by which the NCI is adjusted was

164

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

recognized in additional paid-in capital. No pretax gain or loss was recognized in net income as a result of this transaction.

Dominican Republic — In December 2014 Estrella and Linda Groups, an investor-based group in the Dominican Republic acquired 8%

noncontrolling interest in our businesses in the Dominican Republic for $83 million , net of transaction costs, with options to acquire an additional 2%
for $24 million at any time between the closing date and December 31, 2015, and an additional 10% for $125 million at any time between the closing
date and December 31, 2017. In December 2015, Estrella and Linda Groups exercised its first call option of additional 2% for $18 million , net of
discount and transaction costs. This resulted in Estrella and Linda Groups having a total of 10% noncontrolling interest in our businesses in the
Dominican Republic.

As a result of these transaction, $7 million , net of taxes and transaction costs, was recognized in additional paid-in capital at December 31,

2015. No gain or loss was recognized in net income as the sale was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate. As the Company
maintained control after the sale, our businesses in the Dominican Republic continue to be consolidated by the Company within the MCAC SBU
reportable segment.

Masinloc — On June 25, 2014, the Company executed an agreement to sell approximately 45% of its interest in Masin-AES Pte Ltd., a wholly-
owned subsidiary that owns the Company's business interests in the Philippines, for $453 million , subject to certain purchase price adjustments. On
July 15, 2014, the Company completed the Masinloc sale transaction and received cumulative net proceeds of $436 million , including $23 million
contingent upon the achievement of certain restructuring efficiencies. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of in-substance real estate.
Noncontrolling interest of $130 million and a pretax gain on sale of investment of approximately $283 million , net of transaction costs, were
recognized during the third quarter of 2014. The portion of the proceeds related to the contingency has been deferred.

After completion of the sale, the Company owns a 51% net ownership interest in Masinloc and will continue to manage and operate the plant.

As the Company maintained control after the sale, Masinloc continues to be accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary within the Asia SBU
reportable segment.

The following table summarizes the net income attributable to The AES Corporation and all transfers (to) from noncontrolling interests for the

periods indicated (in millions):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

The common stock repurchased has been classified as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. A total of 156,878,891 and

149,037,831 shares were held as treasury stock at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Restricted stock units under the Company's
employee benefit plans are issued from treasury stock. The Company has not retired any common stock repurchased since it began the Program in
July 2010.

16 . SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The segment reporting structure uses the Company's organizational structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the

businesses internally and is organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The
management reporting structure is organized by six SBUs led by our President and Chief Executive Officer: US, Andes, Brazil, MCAC, Europe, and
Asia SBUs. Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that it has six operating and six reportable segments
corresponding to its SBUs.

Corporate and Other — Corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our six reportable segments are
included in "Corporate and Other." Also included are certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in
consolidation.

The Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary segment performance measure. Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the

Company as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding (1) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative
transactions, (2) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (3) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (4) losses
due to impairments, and (5) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The Company has concluded that Adjusted PTC best reflects the underlying
business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial
performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a
more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results.

Revenue and Adjusted PTC are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other

segments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment
activity has been eliminated within the segment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.

17 . SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

STOCK OPTIONS — AES grants options to purchase shares of common stock under stock option plans to employees and non-employee
directors. Under the terms of the plans, the Company may issue options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to
100% of the market price at the date the option is granted. Stock options are generally granted based upon a percentage of an employee's base
salary. Stock options issued in 2015 and 2014 have a three -year vesting schedule and vest in one-third increments over the three -year period. The
stock options have a contractual term of ten years. The Company did not issue stock options in 2016. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 16
million shares were remaining for award under the plans. In all circumstances, stock options granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or
obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES.

The following table presents the weighted average fair value of each option grant and the underlying weighted average assumptions, as of the

grant date, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:

Expected annual dividend yield

Expected option term (years)

The Company does not discount the grant date fair values to estimate post-vesting restrictions. Post-vesting restrictions include black-out

periods when the employee is not able to exercise stock options based on their potential knowledge of information prior to the release of that
information to the public.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing
stock price on the last trading day of 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2016 . The amount of the aggregate intrinsic value will change
based on the fair market value of the Company's stock.

RESTRICTED STOCK

Restricted Stock Units — The Company issues restricted stock units ("RSUs") under its long-term compensation plan. The RSUs are

generally granted based upon a percentage of the participant's base salary. The units have a three -year vesting schedule and vest in one-third
increments over the three -year period. Units granted prior to 2011 are required to be held for an additional two years before they can be converted
into shares, and thus become transferable. There is no such requirement for units granted in 2011 and afterwards. In all circumstances, restricted
stock units granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the restricted stock unit in cash or other assets of AES.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , RSUs issued had a grant date fair value equal to the closing price of the

Company's stock on the grant date. The Company does not discount the grant date fair values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs granted
to employees during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 had grant date fair values per RSU of $9.42 , $12.03 and $14.60 ,
respectively.

The Company initially recognizes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be

rendered. In 2016 , AES has estimated a weighted average forfeiture rate of 11.54% for RSUs granted in 2016 . This estimate will be revised if
subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated
forfeiture rate, the Company expects to expense $16 million on a straight-line basis over a three year period related to RSUs granted during the year
ended December 31, 2016 .

Performance Stock Units — In 2015 and 2014, the Company issued performance stock units ("PSUs") to officers under its long-term
compensation plan. PSUs are restricted stock units of which 50% of the units awarded include a market condition and the remaining 50% include a
performance condition. Vesting will occur if the applicable continued employment conditions are satisfied and (a) for the units subject to the market
condition the total stockholder return on AES common stock exceeds the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector
Index over the three -year measurement period beginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year and (b) for
the units subject to the performance condition if the Company's actual Adjusted EBITDA meets the performance target over the three -year
measurement period beginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year. The market and performance
conditions determine the vesting and final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200% , depending on
the achievement. PSUs that included a market condition granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 , and 2014 had a grant date fair value
per PSU of $8.22 and $15.19 , respectively.

In 2016, the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-term compensation plan. Vesting will occur if the Company achieves its

Proportional Free Cash Flow target over the three-year performance period beginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of
the third year. The PSUs issued to officers in 2016 had a grant date fair value of $9.41 equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the
grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated at 100% of the company's closing stock price. The company believes that it's probable that the
performance condition will be met and will continue to be evaluated throughout the performance period.

In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the restricted stock unit in cash or other

The Company initially recognizes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be
rendered. In 2016 , AES has estimated a forfeiture rate of 12.28% for PSUs granted in 2016. This estimate will be revised if subsequent information
indicates that the actual number of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the
Company expects to expense $6 million on a straight-line basis over a three year period (approximately $2 million per year) related to PSUs granted
during the year ended December 31, 2016 .

Performance Cash Units - In 2016 , the Company issued Performance Cash Units ("PCUs") to its officers under its long-term compensation

plan. The value of these units depends on the total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the
Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index and MSCI Emerging Market Index over a three -year measurement
period beginning on January 1 of the grant year and ending on December 31 of the third year. Since PCUs are settled in cash, they qualify for
liability accounting and periodic measurement is required. As of December 31, 2016, each PCU is valued at $1.04 per unit. The Company expects to
expense $7 million on a straight-line basis over a three year period (approximately $2 million per year) related to these PCUs.

Colon — During the year ended December 31, 2016 , our partner in Colon increased their ownership from 25% to 49.9% and made capital

contributions of $106 million . Any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to our partner, or measure the investment at fair
value, will be classified as temporary equity each reporting period as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable.

IPL — IPL had $60 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , which represented five series of
preferred stock. The total annual dividend requirements were approximately $3 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Certain series of the
preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the issuer at prices between $100 and $118 per share. Holders of the preferred stock are
entitled to elect a majority of IPL's board of directors if IPL has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters. Based
on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of IPL's board of directors in this circumstance, the redemption of the preferred shares is
considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock is considered temporary equity.

DPL — DPL had $18 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , which represented three series of preferred
stock issued by DP&L, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DPL. The DP&L preferred stock was redeemable at DP&L's option as determined by its board
of directors at per-share redemption prices between $101 and $103 per share, plus cumulative preferred dividends. In addition, DP&L's Amended
Articles of Incorporation contained provisions that permitted preferred stockholders to elect members of the DP&L Board of Directors in the event
that cumulative dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to at least four full quarterly dividends. Based on
the preferred stockholders' ability to elect members of DP&L's board of directors in this circumstance, the redemption of the preferred shares was
considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity.

In September 2016, it became probable that the preferred shares would become redeemable. As such, the Company recorded an adjustment
of $5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption value of $23 million . In October 2016, DP&L redeemed all of its
preferred shares. Upon redemption, the preferred shares were no longer outstanding and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of DP&L
ceased to exist.

IPALCO — In February 2015, CDPQ purchased 15% of AES US Investment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that owns 100% of IPALCO, for

$247 million , with an option to invest an additional $349 million in IPALCO through 2016 in exchange for a 17.65% equity stake. In April 2015,
CDPQ invested an additional $214 million in IPALCO, which resulted in CDPQ's combined direct and indirect interest in IPALCO of 24.90% . As a
result of these transactions, $84 million in taxes and transaction costs were recognized as a net decrease to equity. The Company also recognized
an increase to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of 377 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their
book value. No gain or loss was recognized in net income as the transaction was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate.

In March 2016, CDPQ exercised its remaining option by investing $134 million in IPALCO, which resulted in CDPQ's combined direct and
indirect interest in IPALCO of 30% . The Company also recognized an increase to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of
$84 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value. In June 2016, CDPQ contributed an additional $24 million to IPALCO,
with no impact to the ownership structure of the investment. Any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to CDPQ will be
classified as NCI within permanent equity as it is not probable that the shares will become redeemable.

Buffalo Gap I — During 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Buffalo Gap I. Low wind production during 2016
resulted in management lowering future expectations of production and therefore future forecasted revenues. As such this was determined to be an
impairment indicator. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap I asset group
was determined to have a fair value of $36 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized an asset impairment expense
of $77 million ( $23 million attributable to AES). Buffalo Gap I is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

DPL — During the second quarter of 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived generation assets at DPL. Uncertainty
created by the Supreme Court of Ohio’s June 20, 2016 opinion regarding ESP 2, lower expectations of future revenue resulting from the most recent
PJM capacity auction, and higher anticipated environmental compliance costs resulting from third party studies were collectively determined to be an
impairment indicator for these assets. The Company performed a long-lived asset impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of
Killen, a coal-fired generation facility, and certain DPL peaking generation facilities were not recoverable. The Killen and DPL peaking generation
asset groups were determined to have a fair value of $84 million and $5 million , respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company
recognized a total asset impairment expense of $235 million . DPL is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived coal-fired generation assets and one gas-fired peaking

plant at DPL. Additional uncertainty around the useful life of Stuart and Killen

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

related to the Company’s ESP proceedings, along with lower expected forward dark spreads and capacity prices, were collectively determined to be
an impairment indicator for these assets. Market information indicating that there was a significant decrease in the fair value of Zimmer and Miami
Fort was determined to be an indicator of impairment for these assets. The lower forward dark spreads and capacity prices, along with the indicators
at the other coal-fired facilities, collectively, resulted in an indicator of impairment for the Conesville asset group. For the gas-fired peaking plant,
significant incremental capital expenditures relative to its fair value, and an impairment charge taken at this facility in Q2 2016, were collectively
determined to be impairment indicators for this asset. The Company performed a long-lived asset impairment analysis for each of these asset
groups and determined that their carrying amounts were not recoverable. The Stuart, Killen, Miami Fort, Zimmer, Conesville and the gas-fired
peaking plant asset groups were determined to have a fair value of  $57 million , $43 million , $36 million , $24 million ,  $1 million and $2 million ,
respectively, using the market approach for Miami Fort and Zimmer and the income approach for the remaining asset groups. As a result, the
Company recognized a total pre-tax asset impairment expense of  $624 million . DPL is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

Buffalo Gap II — During 2016, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Buffalo Gap II. Impairment indicators were
identified based on a decline in forward power curves. The Company determined that the carrying amount was not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap II
asset group was determined to have a fair value of $92 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized an asset
impairment expense of $159 million ( $49 million attributable to AES). Buffalo Gap II is reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

Kilroot — During 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of long-lived assets at Kilroot, a coal- and oil-fired plant in the U.K., when the
regulator established lower capacity prices for the Irish Single Electricity Market. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset
group was not recoverable. The Kilroot asset group was determined to have a fair value of $70 million using the income approach. As a result, the
Company recognized asset impairment expense of $121 million . Kilroot is reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.

Buffalo Gap III — During 2015, the Company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at Buffalo Gap III, a wind farm in Texas.

Impairment indicators were identified based on a decline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cash
flows. The Company determined that the carrying amount was not recoverable. The Buffalo Gap III asset group was determined to have a fair value
of $118 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $116 million . Buffalo Gap III is
reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

U.K. Wind — During 2015, the Company decided to no longer pursue two wind projects in the U.K. based on recent regulatory clarifications

specific to these projects, resulting in a full impairment. Impairment indicators were also identified at four other wind projects based on their current
development status and a reassessment of the likelihood that each project would be pursued given aviation concerns, regulatory changes,
economic considerations and other factors. The Company determined that the carrying amounts of each of these asset groups, which totaled $38
million , were not recoverable. In aggregate, the asset groups were determined to have a fair value of $1 million using the market approach and, as
a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $37 million . The U.K. Wind Projects are reported in the Europe SBU reportable
segment.

Ebute — During 2014, the Company identified impairment indicators at Ebute in Nigeria, resulting from the continued lack of gas supply, the
increased likelihood of selling the asset group before the end of its useful life, and indications about the potential proceeds that could be received
from a future sale. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Company recognized asset
impairment of $67 million , which represents the difference between the carrying amount of $103 million and fair value less cost to sell of $36 million
. In November 2014, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ebute. See Note 23 — Dispositions for additional details. Prior to its sale,
Ebute was reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.

U.K. Wind (Newfield) — During 2014, the Company tested the recoverability of long-lived assets at its Newfield wind development project in
the U.K. after their government refused to grant a permit necessary for the project to continue. The Company determined that the carrying amount of
the asset group was not recoverable. The Newfield asset group was determined to have no fair value using the income approach. As a result, the
Company recognized asset impairment expense of $12 million . U.K. Wind (Newfield) is reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.

East Bend (DP&L) — During 2014, the Company identified impairment indicators at East Bend, a coal-fired plant in Ohio jointly owned by

DP&L, resulting from the increased likelihood that the asset group would be disposed

175

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

prior to the end of its useful life. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The East Bend asset
group was determined to have a fair value of $2 million using the market approach, and the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $12
million . The Company's interest in East Bend was sold in December 2014. Prior to its sale, East Bend was reported in the US SBU reportable
segment.

For 2016 , included in the favorable 215% taxes on foreign earnings percentage above is approximately 151% related to the current year

benefit resulting from a restructuring of one of our Brazilian subsidiaries that increased tax basis in long-term assets. The 42% Buffalo Gap
impairments item relates to the amounts of impairment allocated to noncontrolling interest which is nondeductible.

Included in the favorable 15% 2014 taxes on foreign earnings percentage above is approximately 9% related to the sale of approximately 45%
of the Company's interest in Masin AES Pte Ltd., which owns the Company's interests in the Philippines, and the sale of the Company's interests in
four U.K. wind projects. Neither of these transactions gave rise to income tax expense.

Chilean Tax Reform — In February 2016, the Chilean government enacted further reforms to its income tax laws that resulted in an increase

to statutory income tax rates for most of our Chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years. The impact of
remeasuring deferred taxes to account for the enacted change in future applicable income tax rates was recognized as discrete income tax expense
in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in an increase of $26 million to consolidated income tax expense.

176

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

Deferred Income Taxes — Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of

assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. These items are stated at the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.

As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately $3.5 billion expiring in

years 2021 to 2036. Approximately $88 million of the net operating loss carryforward related to stock option deductions will be recognized in
additional paid-in capital when realized. The Company also had federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $20 million
expiring primarily from 2021 to 2036, and federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $5 million that carry forward without expiration.
The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $9.1 billion expiring in years 2017 to 2036. As
of December 31, 2016 , the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3.1 billion that expire at various times
beginning in 2017 and some of which carry forward without expiration, and tax credits available in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $32 million ,
$22 million of which expire in 2021 and $8 million of which carryforward without expiration.

Valuation allowances decreased $18 million during 2016 to $876 million at December 31, 2016 . This net decrease was primarily the result of

valuation allowance releases and foreign exchange gains at certain of our Brazil subsidiaries.

Valuation allowances decreased $103 million during 2015 to $894 million at December 31, 2015 . This net decrease was primarily the result of

foreign exchange losses and valuation allowance releases at certain of our Brazil and Vietnam subsidiaries.

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown below will be realized when future taxable
income is generated through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and income that is expected to be generated by businesses that
have long-term contracts or a history of generating taxable income. The Company continues to monitor the utilization of its deferred tax asset for its
U.S. consolidated net operating loss carryforward. Although management believes it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be
realized through generation of sufficient taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards, such
realization is not assured.

The Company considers undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, accordingly,

no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded with respect to such earnings in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes.
Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. As of
December 31, 2016 , the cumulative amount of foreign un-remitted earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately
$4 billion . It is not practicable to estimate the amount of any additional taxes which may be payable on the undistributed earnings.

Income from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding

employment and capital investment. The Company's income tax benefits related to the tax status of these operations are estimated to be $20 million
, $21 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The per share effect of these benefits after
noncontrolling interests was $0.02 , $0.02 and $0.04  for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

We are potentially subject to income tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally until the applicable statute of limitations
expires. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. The following is a summary of tax years potentially

As of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $369 million , $373 million and $394 million ,

respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would benefit the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is
$332 million , $343 million and $366 million , respectively, of which $24 million , $24 million and $24 million , respectively, would be in the form of tax
attributes that would warrant a full valuation allowance.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated to result in a net decrease to unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of

December 31, 2016 is estimated to be up to $10 million , primarily relating to statute of limitation lapses and tax exam settlements.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The
Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the
amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular
uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit
settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or
decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future
examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of
December 31, 2016 . Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted.

22 . DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Brazil Distribution — Due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016, management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution

companies in Brazil, AES Sul and Eletropaulo. The disposal of Sul was completed in October 2016. In December 2016, Eletropaulo underwent a
corporate restructuring which is expected to, among other things, provide more liquidity of its shares. AES is continuing to pursue strategic options
for Eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce AES’ exposure to the Brazilian distribution business, including preparation for listing
its shares into the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance.

The Company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary AES Sul in June 2016. We have reported the results of

operations and financial position of AES Sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Upon
meeting the held-for-sale criteria, the Company recognized an after tax loss of $382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $783 million
, offset by a tax benefit of $266 million related to the impairment of the Sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $135 million for deferred taxes
related to the investment in AES Sul. Prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter, the carrying value of the AES Sul asset group of $1.6
billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell. However, the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long
lived assets of the AES Sul disposal group.

On October 31, 2016 , the Company completed the sale of AES Sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $484 million , excluding

contingent consideration. Upon disposal of AES Sul, we incurred an additional after-tax loss on sale of $737 million . The cumulative impact to
earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $1.1 billion . This includes the reclassification of approximately $1 billion of cumulative translation
losses, resulting in a net reduction to the Company’s stockholders’ equity of $92 million .

Sul’s pretax loss attributable to AES for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 billion and $32 million , respectively. Sul’s

pretax gain attributable to AES for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $133 million . Prior to its classification as discontinued operations, Sul
was reported in the Brazil SBU reportable segment.

As discussed in Note 1 — General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , effective July 1, 2014, the Company prospectively
adopted ASU No. 2014-08. Discontinued operations prior to adoption of ASU No. 2014-08 include the results of Cameroon, Saurashtra and various
U.S. wind projects which were each sold in the first half of 2014.

Cameroon — In September 2013, the Company executed agreements for the sale of its 56% equity interests in businesses in Cameroon:

Sonel, an integrated utility, Kribi, a gas and light fuel oil plant, and Dibamba, a heavy

179

fuel oil plant. The sale was completed in June 2014. Net proceeds from the sale transaction were $200 million , of which $156 million was received
in 2014. Of the remaining non-contingent consideration of $44 million , $40 million was received in the second quarter of 2016. Between meeting the
held-for-sale criteria in September 2013 and completing the sale in June 2014, the Company recognized impairments of $101 million and an
additional loss on sale of $7 million . Prior to classification as discontinued operations, these businesses were reported in the Europe SBU
reportable segment.

Saurashtra — In October 2013, the Company executed an agreement for the sale of Saurashtra, a wind project in India. The sale transaction

was completed in February 2014 and net proceeds of $8 million were received. Prior to its classification as discontinued operations, Saurashtra was
reported in the Asia SBU reportable segment.

U.S. Wind Projects — In November 2013, the Company executed an agreement for the sale of its 100% membership interests in three wind

projects: Condon in California, Lake Benton I in Minnesota and Storm Lake II in Iowa. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria for these three
projects, the Company recognized impairment expense of $47 million (of which $7 million was attributable to noncontrolling interests held by tax
equity partners) representing the difference between their aggregate carrying amount of $77 million and the fair value less costs to sell of $30 million
. The sale was completed in January 2014 and net proceeds of $27 million were received. Prior to classification as discontinued operations, these
businesses were reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

As the sale of AES Sul closed October 31, 2016 , there were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations and held-for-sale businesses at
December 31, 2016 . The following table summarizes the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations

U.K. Wind — During the second quarter of 2016, the Company deconsolidated UK Wind and recorded a loss on deconsolidation of $20 million

to Gain on disposal and sale of businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to deconsolidation, UK Wind was reported in the
Europe SBU reportable segment. See Note 15 — Equity for additional information.

DPLER — In December 2015, the Company executed an agreement for the sale of its ownership interest in DPLER, a competitive retail
marketer selling electricity to customers in Ohio. Accordingly, DPLER was classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2015, but did not meet the
criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation. DPLER's results were therefore reflected within continuing operations in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

On January 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its interest in DPLER and recognized a gain on sale of $49 million . Proceeds of $76

million were received on December 31, 2015. The proceeds were classified as restricted cash with a corresponding amount recorded in Accrued
and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. DPLER's pretax income attributable to AES for the year ended
December 31, 2015 was $11 million and pretax loss attributable to AES for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $129 million . Prior to its sale,
DPLER was reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

Kelanitissa — In August 2015, the Company executed an agreement for the sale of its 90% ownership interest in Kelanitissa, a diesel-fired

generation plant in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, Kelanitissa was classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2015, but did not meet the criteria to be
reported as a discontinued operation. Kelanitissa's results were therefore reflected within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

On January 27, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Kelanitissa. Upon completion, proceeds of $18 million were received
and a loss on sale of $5 million was recognized. Kelanitissa's pretax loss attributable to AES for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7 million
and pretax income attributable to AES for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1 million . Prior to its sale, Kelanitissa was reported in the Asia
SBU reportable segment.

Armenia Mountain — Under the terms of the sale agreement for certain U.S. Wind Projects, the buyer was provided an option to purchase the

Company's 100% interest in Armenia Mountain, a wind project in Pennsylvania, at a fixed price of $75 million . The buyer exercised the option on
March 31, 2015 and completed the sale of its interest in Armenia Mountain on July 1, 2015. The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as a
discontinued operation. Upon completion, net proceeds of $64 million were received and a pretax gain on sale of $22 million was recognized.
Excluding the gain on sale, Armenia Mountain's pretax income attributable to AES was $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively. Prior to its sale, Armenia Mountain was reported in the US SBU reportable segment.

Ebute — On November 20, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Ebute, which included its 95% interest in AES Nigeria

Barge Limited and its 100% interest in AES Nigeria Barge Operations Limited. Proceeds from the sale were $22 million and the Company
recognized a loss on sale of $6 million . As Ebute did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation, its results were reflected
within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Excluding the loss on sale, Ebute's pretax loss attributable to AES was
$27 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Prior to its sale, Ebute was reported in the Europe SBU reportable segment.

U.K. Wind (Operating Projects) — On August 22, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its interests in four operating wind projects located

in the U.K.. Total net proceeds from the sale were $158 million and the Company recognized a pretax gain on sale of $78 million . As these wind
projects did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations, their results were reflected within continuing operations in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Excluding the gain on sale, the pretax loss attributable to AES for these disposed projects was $18

segment.

24 . ACQUISITIONS

Distributed Energy — On February 18, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of Main Street Power

Company, Inc. for approximately $25 million . The purchase consideration was composed of $20 million cash and the fair value of earn-out
payments of $5 million . At December 31, 2015, the assets acquired (including $4 million cash) and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were
recorded at fair value based on the final purchase price allocation, which resulted in the recognition of $16 million of goodwill. After the date of
acquisition, Main Street Power Company, Inc. was renamed Distributed Energy, Inc.

On September 16, 2016, Distributed Energy acquired the equity interest of various projects held by multiple partnerships for approximately $43

million . These partnerships were previously classified as equity method investments. In accordance with the accounting guidance for business
combinations, the Company has recorded the opening balance sheets of the acquired businesses based on the purchase price allocation as of the
acquisition date.

25 . EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock

outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive
restricted stock units, stock options and convertible securities. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock
method or the if-converted method, as applicable.

The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income

from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , where income represents the numerator and weighted-
average shares represent the denominator. Values are in millions except per share data:

Income from continuing operations, net of tax, of $ 8 million less the $ 5 million adjustment to retained earnings to record the DP&L redeemable preferred stock at its redemption value as of December 31,
2016 .

The calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded 8 million , 8 million and 6 million stock awards outstanding for the years ended
December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Additionally, for the years
ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , all 15 million convertible debentures were omitted from the earnings per share calculation. The stock
awards and convertible debentures were excluded from the calculation because they were anti-dilutive.

26 . RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

AES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into six market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the
Company's principal markets in Note  16 — Segment and Geographic Information . Within our six SBUs, we have two primary lines of business:
Generation and Utilities. The Generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas,
hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Our Utilities business is comprised of businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate
power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind and solar.

Operating and Economic Risks — The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are usually

more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions often expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash
flows due to, among other factors, adverse

182

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards,
which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has a below-investment grade
rating from Standard & Poor's of BB-. This could affect the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing development projects at competitive
interest rates. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

During 2016 , 74% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in
developing countries. We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations,
particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without
limitation:

inability to economically hedge energy prices;
volatility in commodity prices;

• economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•
•
• adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
• government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
• unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;
• high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•
•
• unwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their commitments;
• unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to

restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;

subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are
governments or private parties;
inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;

•
• adverse changes in government tax policy;
• difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and
• potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.

Any of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and

financial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to
cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political
instability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces
the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.

Our inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonable

increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly
announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of
regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our Utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or
approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:

changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;
changes in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;

•
•
• adverse changes in tax law;
•
•
• other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or

changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
changes in the timing of tariff increases;

183

THE AES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014

•

changes in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.

Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our results of operations.

Construction — As of December 31, 2016 , the Company has 531 MW under construction at Alto Maipo. Increased project costs, or delays in

construction, could have an adverse impact on the Company.

Foreign Currency Risks — AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollar and the following currencies could
create significant fluctuations to earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Dominican Republic peso, the Euro, the Chilean
peso, the Colombian peso, the Philippine peso and the Kazakhstan tenge.

Concentrations — Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers
or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority
of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of
total revenue in 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .

The cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our
customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs
and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such
contracts at equally favorable terms.

27 . RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Certain of our businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic are partially owned by governments either directly or through state-owned
institutions. In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements
with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the offtakers exercise
significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are also required to hold a
nominal ownership interest in such businesses. In Chile, we provide capacity and energy under contractual arrangements to our investment which is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, the Company provides certain support and management services to several of its
affiliates under various agreements.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the

reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

The Company carried out the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of our

management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2016 , our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP
and includes those policies and procedures that:
•

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and
provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements are prevented or detected timely.

•

•

Management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control

system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may
become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
deteriorates.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment,

management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission ("COSO") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , has been audited by Ernst &

Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

There were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to

materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The AES Corporation:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

We have audited The AES Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the
COSO criteria). The AES Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial

reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any

evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The AES Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,

2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of The AES Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of The AES Corporation and our
report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE I

1. Application of Significant Accounting Principles

The Schedule I Condensed Financial Information of the Parent includes the accounts of The AES Corporation (the “Parent Company”) and

certain holding companies.

Accounting for Subsidiaries and Affiliates —The Parent Company has accounted for the earnings of its subsidiaries on the equity method

in the financial information.

Income Taxes —Positions taken on the Parent Company's income tax return which satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold will be recognized

in the financial statements. The income tax expense or benefit computed for the Parent Company reflects the tax assets and liabilities on a stand-
alone basis and the effect of filing a consolidated U.S. income tax return with certain other affiliated companies.

Accounts and Notes Receivable from Subsidiaries —Amounts have been shown in current or long-term assets based on terms in

agreements with subsidiaries, but payment is dependent upon meeting conditions precedent in the subsidiary loan agreements.

pursuant to Section 1.09(d) and (iv) include the fees and expenses allocated pursuant to Section 1.09(h) .

(h)      The Accounting Firm shall serve in the role of an expert and not in the role of an arbitrator. If

any  disputed  items  are  referred  to  the  Accounting  Firm,  the  Majority  Member  and  the  Parent  Representative  shall

meetings  solely  involving  the  submission  of  a  request  for  documents  or  information  by  the  Accounting  Firm  to  such
party) without the prior consent of the Majority Member, or the Parent Representative, as applicable. The determinations
of the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error. The cost of any
dispute  resolution  (including  the  fees  and  expenses  of  the  Accounting  Firm  and  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and
expenses  of  the  Parties)  pursuant  to  this  Section  1.09  shall  be  borne  by  the  Majority  Member  (including  from  the
Majority  Member  Reserve  Fund),  on  the  one  hand,  and  Parents,  on  the  other  hand,  as  shall  be  determined  by  the
Accounting Firm such that the Majority Member (including from the Majority Member Reserve Fund) shall bear the costs
in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm which were resolved in
Parents’ favor bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm, with Parents bearing the
remainder,  if  any,  which  proportionate  allocations  shall  also  be  determined  by  the  Accounting  Firm  at  the  time  the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

(i)            The  “  Final  Merger  Consideration  ”  shall  be  calculated  by  recalculating  the  Merger
Consideration  calculated  and  paid  on  the  Closing  Date  using  the  Closing  Consideration,  as  finally  determined  in
accordance with this Section 1.09 . If the Final Merger Consideration is more than the Merger Consideration calculated
and paid on the Closing Date, Parents shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding
on the Parties, make payment by wire transfer, to accounts designated by the Majority Member for the ratable benefit (in
accordance with each Member’s Allocable Share) of and further distribution to each Member, other than the MIP, if the
Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, in immediately available funds, of the amount of such difference
(the “ Excess Amount ”), which funds shall be allocated among the Members by the Majority Member in proportion to
each Member’s Allocable Share. If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Merger Consideration calculated and
paid on the Closing Date, the Majority Member shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Statement becomes final
and  binding  on  the  Parties,  make  payment  by  wire  transfer,  to  an  account  or  accounts  designated  by  the  Parent
Representative,  in  immediately  available  funds  of  the  amount  of  such  difference  (the  “  Deficiency  Amount  ”),  which
payment may be made in whole or in part from the Majority Member Reserve Fund.

(j)      In connection with the determination of Closing Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.09 :

(i)      during the ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Majority Member shall assist, and

shall direct the other Members to assist, the

Majority  Member  reasonable  access  (at  the  requesting  party’s  sole  cost  and  expense)  during  normal  business
hours  to  the  personnel,  properties,  books  and  Records  of  the  Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries  as  is
reasonably necessary for the purpose of assisting with and reviewing the Statement;

(ii)      from the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Section 1.09 , Parents shall not take any action with respect to the accounting books and
Records of the Company on which the Statement is to be based that is not consistent with the Company’s past
practices that would materially impact the Statement; and

(iii)      from the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the Merger Consideration
contemplated  by  this  Section  1.09  ,  Parents  shall  afford,  and  shall  cause  the  Company  to  afford,  the  Majority
Member and its independent accountants reasonable access (at the requesting party’s sole cost and expense) to
the personnel, properties, books and Records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably
necessary for the purpose of reviewing the adjustments contemplated by this Section 1.09 .

(k)            A  Party  claiming  that  any  other  Party  has  failed  to  comply  with  its  obligations  under

Section 1.09(j) to provide access to information may initiate the appointment of the Accounting Firm by making a written
request directly to the Accounting Firm. If the Majority Member or the Parent Representative initiates the appointment of
the Accounting Firm under this Section 1.09(k) , the Accounting Firm shall have the authority (i) to determine if a Party
has complied with its obligations to provide access to the information required pursuant to  Section 1.09(j) and to order
that a Party comply with any such obligations, (ii) to extend any deadlines set forth in this Section 1.09 , including the
immediate temporary suspension of such deadlines during the time period necessary to resolve the disputed issue, and
(iii)  to  allow  the  Majority  Member  or  the  Parent  Representative  the  right  to  amend  any  prior  Statement  or  Notice  of
Disagreement where it finds that such Party had been prejudiced by the failure to have been provided access to such
information.

(l)      The pendency of a dispute shall not affect the payment obligation of Parents or the Majority
Member under Section 1.09(i) to the extent of any undisputed portion of any payment to be made by the Parties under
this  Article  I  after  the  Closing.  If  any  portion  of  the  payment  is  disputed  under  this  Section  1.09  ,  the  Final  Merger
Consideration shall be calculated on a preliminary basis using only the undisputed items,

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-12-

and  to  the  extent  the  Final  Merger  Consideration  so  calculated  is  greater  than  or  less  than  the  portion  of  the  Merger
Consideration applicable to such undisputed items, then the applicable payment shall be made on a preliminary basis
pursuant to Section 1.09(i) within five (5) Business Days after the undisputed items have become final. If a preliminary
payment is made pursuant to this Section 1.09(l) , then, upon final resolution of the Closing Consideration, the payment
then required to be made in accordance with Section 1.09(i) shall be made, without duplication, after giving effect to the
preliminary payment so paid.

Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, (ii) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, funds are paid to the Majority
Member subsequent to the Closing for allocation among the Members and (iii) at the time that such payment is made,
neither  the  Put  Right  nor  the  Call  Right  have  been  exercised,  then  the  MIP’s  Allocable  Share  (calculated  as  if  the

Liability Company Agreement  in the event that the  Put Right or Call Right  are thereafter exercised by the  MIP. In the
event that (i) the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, (ii) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, funds
are paid to the Majority Member subsequent to the Closing for allocation among the Members and (iii) at the time that
such payment is made, the Put Right or Call Right had already been exercised, then the Majority Member shall pay to

such  payment.  To  avoid  duplication,  amounts  paid  in  respect  of  the  MIP’s  Allocable  Share  under  this  Section 1.10(g)

October 31, 2017, and the Majority Member) who does not deliver a duly completed Letter of Transmittal to the Majority
Member  on  or  prior  to  the  Closing  Date,  promptly  (but  in  no  event  later  than  ten  (10)  Business  Days)  following  such

portion of the Merger Consideration that had been paid to the Majority Member at the Closing and which has not been
disbursed to the Members (unless such amount is the subject of a dispute between any Parties), and thereafter, such
Members  shall  be  entitled  to  look  only  to  the  Surviving  LLC  (subject  to  abandoned  property,  escheat  or  other  similar
Applicable  Laws),  as  general  creditors  thereof  with  respect  to  the  payment  of  any  Merger  Consideration,  that  would
otherwise be payable upon the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal by each such Member, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by each such Member at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the property of Parents, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Majority Member, Parents or the Surviving LLC
shall  be  liable  to  any  direct  or  indirect  former  Member  (or  any  successor  or  assignee  thereof)  for  any  portion  of  the
Merger  Consideration  or  interest  thereon  properly  delivered  to  a  public  official  pursuant  to  any  applicable  abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Applicable Law.

other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) is required to pay the Surviving LLC (or
the  Parent  Representative  or  Parents,  if  applicable)  any  amount  pursuant  to  Section  1.09  or  Section  1.10  ,  and  the
Majority  Member  does  not  pay  any  such  amount  to  the  Surviving  LLC  (or  the  Parent  Representative  or  Parents,  if
applicable) from the Majority Member Reserve Fund within fifteen (15) days after the Majority Member receives a written
request for payment from the applicable Party, then Parents (on behalf of themselves and the Surviving LLC) shall be
entitled to deduct and offset any such amount from or against any amount that either Parent or the Surviving LLC may
be  required  to  pay  to  the  Majority  Member  (ratably  for  the  benefit  of  and  further  distribution  to  all  of  the  Members  in
accordance with their respective Allocable Shares, other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October
31, 2017) pursuant to Section 1.09 or Section 1.10 .

violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”).

(b)      Each Parent has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the proposed investment in the Membership Interests, and each Parent is
an “accredited investor,” as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

(c)      Each Parent understands that neither the offer nor the sale of the Membership Interests has
been, and that neither the offer nor the sale of the Membership Interests will be, registered under the Securities Act or
any applicable state securities laws.

(d)            Each  Parent  has  had  an  opportunity  to  discuss  the  business  of  the  Company  and  the
Company  Subsidiaries,  their  respective  management  and  financial  affairs  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the
Transactions with the Company’s management.

Section  4.06.            No  General  Solicitation  .  None  of  Parents,  Merger  Subs  or  their  respective

offer and sale of the Membership Interests.

Section 4.07.      Availability of Funds . Parents (a) will have as of the Closing Date, cash and immediately

available funds sufficient to enable each of them to consummate the Transactions and pay any expenses incurred by
Parents  and  Merger  Subs  in  connection  with  the  Transactions  and  (b)  have  not  incurred,  and  will  not  incur  as  of  the
Closing Date, any obligation, commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, which would prevent the payment of funds
necessary to consummate the Transactions.

Section 4.08.      Financing .

copies of executed equity commitment letters dated as of the

(a)      The Parent Representative has delivered to the Majority Member true, correct and complete

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-40-

Effective  Date  (the  “  Equity  Commitment  Letters  ”)  pursuant  to  which  certain  equity  investors  identified  therein  have
committed,  upon  the  terms  and  subject  to  the  conditions  thereof,  to  invest  funds  in  Parents  as  set  forth  therein  (the  “
Equity  Financing  ”).  The  Equity  Commitment  Letters  provide  that  the  Company  is  an  express  third  party  beneficiary
thereof and the Company is entitled to enforce such Equity Commitment Letters, in each case, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof.

(b)      Each of the Equity Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or  terminated  or  otherwise  amended,  supplemented  or  modified  in  any  respect,  no  such  amendment,  supplement  or
modification that is or would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company is contemplated and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect.  There are no other
Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to which either Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is a party
relating to the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters. Each of the Equity
Commitment  Letters, in  the form  so delivered,  is a  legal,  valid and  binding obligation  of the  applicable Parent  Affiliate
party  thereto,  except  as  such  enforceability  may  be  subject  to  the  Enforceability  Exceptions.  No  event  has  occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of either Parent or
any Affiliate of either Parent that is party thereto under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Equity Commitment
Letters,  or  otherwise  result  in  any  portion  of  the  Equity  Financing  contemplated  thereby  to  be  unavailable  or  delayed.
There are no conditions precedent relating to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letters. None of Parents or Merger Subs have reason to believe that any of them could
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by
them.

(c)            The  net  proceeds  of  the  Equity  Financing,  when  funded  in  accordance  with  the  Equity
Commitment Letters, will be, in the aggregate, as of the Closing Date, sufficient to enable Parents to consummate the
Transactions  as  contemplated  hereby  and  pay  any  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  Parents  and  Merger  Subs  in
connection  with  the  Transactions.  None  of  Parents  or  Merger  Subs  has  incurred,  and  will  not  incur  as  of  the  Closing
Date, any obligation, commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, which would impair or adversely affect, other than in
a de minimis manner, either Parent’s or either Merger Sub’s ability to consummate the Transaction and pay all related
transaction expenses as contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)            With  respect  to  Parent  II  and  Merger  Sub  II,  (i)  this  Agreement  and  the  Transactions  are
commercial rather than public or governmental acts and neither Parent II nor Merger Sub II is entitled to claim immunity
from legal proceedings with respect

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-41-

to itself or any of its assets on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise under any applicable laws or in any jurisdiction
where an action may be brought for the enforcement of any of the obligations arising under or relating to this Agreement
and (ii) to the extent that either Parent II or Merger Sub II or any of its respective assets has or hereafter may acquire
any  right  to  immunity  from  set-off,  legal  proceedings,  attachment  prior  to  judgment,  other  attachment  or  execution  of
judgment  on  the  grounds  of  sovereignty  or  otherwise,  each  of  Parent  II  and  Merger  Sub  II  hereby  irrevocably  waives
such rights to immunity in respect of its obligations arising under or relating to this Agreement.

Section 4.09.      Finders and Investment Bankers . None of Parents, Merger Subs or any of their respective
officers, directors or Affiliates, as applicable, has employed any investment banker, financial advisor, broker or finder in
connection  with  the  Transactions,  except  for  Credit  Suisse  Securities  (USA)  LLC,  or  incurred  any  Liability  for  any
investment banking, business consultancy, financial advisory, brokerage or finders’ fees or commissions in connection
with the Transactions, except for fees payable to Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, all of which have been or will be
paid by Parents in accordance with the agreements between Parents and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC.

Section 4.10.            Litigation .  As  of  the  Effective  Date,  there  is  no  Proceeding  or  claim  pending  or,  to  the
Knowledge of Parents, threatened in writing, to which either Parent or either Merger Sub is a party, in any such case at
law or in equity before any Governmental Authority or arbitral body, against or affecting either Parent or either Merger
Sub which would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the Effective Date, none of Parents or Merger Subs is
subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority or any arbitrator that prohibits
the consummation of the Transactions or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.11.      Condition of the Business . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary,  each  Parent  and  each  Merger  Sub  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  none  of  the  Members,  the  Company,  the
Company Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing is making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express
or implied, beyond those given by the Company in Article II and by the Majority Member in Article III (in each case, as
modified  by  any  applicable  Disclosure  Schedules),  and  each  Parent  acknowledges  and  agrees  that,  except  for  the
representations and warranties contained therein, the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is being
transferred on a “where is” and, as to condition, on an “as is” basis. Any claims either Parent or either Merger Sub may
have  for  breach  of  representation  or  warranty  shall  be  based  solely  on  the  representations  and  warranties  of  the
Company set forth in Article II and by the Majority Member in Article III (in each case as modified by the Disclosure

Company,  the  Company  Subsidiaries  or  any  of  their  respective  Affiliates  or  any  other  Person  has  made  any
representation  or  warranty,  express  or  implied,  as  to  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of  any  information  regarding  the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Projects or the Transactions not set forth herein or in the other Transaction
Documents. Nothing herein shall prohibit or prevent either Parent or either Merger Sub from bringing claims for actual
and intentional fraud or willful misconduct against the Majority Member or the Company.

Merger Subs hereby disclaim any other representations or warranties with respect to Parents and Merger Subs. Except

Representative the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(a)(iv) , and (y)(i) of which the Company
and the Majority Member had no Knowledge prior to the Effective Date or (ii) which occurrence, event, action or inaction
first  occurred  (or  did  not  occur,  as  the  case  may  be)  following  the  Effective  Date,  and  in  each  case,  the  Parent
Representative fails to deliver written notice to the Majority Member disclosing such matter in reasonable detail within
twenty  (20)  calendar  days  of  the  applicable  Parent  or  Merger  Sub  becoming  aware  thereof,  then  Parents  and  Merger
Subs  shall  be  deemed  to  have  waived  any  right  to  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section  7.01(a)(iv)  in

notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  materials  furnished  by  Parents  or  the  Company  to  the  other  Party  pursuant  to  this
Section  5.03(a)  may  be  redacted  (x)  to  remove  references  concerning  the  valuation  of  the  Company  or  (y)  as  is
reasonably necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or other confidentiality obligations or Applicable Law or
to address reasonable attorney-client or other reasonable privilege concerns.

(b)          Without limiting the foregoing, (i) none of Parents, Merger Subs, the Company, the Majority
Member and their respective Affiliates shall elect to extend any waiting period or comparable period under Competition
Laws  or  enter  into  any  agreement  with  any  Governmental  Authority  not  to  consummate  the  Transactions,  except  with
the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Majority  Member  or  the  Parent  Representative,  as  applicable,  and  (ii)  Parents  and
Merger Subs agree to take (and Parents’ and Merger Subs’ “reasonable best efforts” shall expressly include) all actions

Authority to expeditiously (and in no event later than the Outside Date) consummate the Transactions, including offering,
negotiating,  committing  to  and  effect,  by  consent  decree,  hold  separate  order  or  otherwise,  (A)  the  sale,  divestiture,

respective  Affiliates,  if  applicable),  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries  on  the  other
hand,  and  (B)  any  other  restrictions  on  the  activities  of  Parents  and  Merger  Subs  (and  their  respective  Affiliates,  if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand; provided , however ,
subject to Section 7.01(a)(vii) , that nothing hereunder shall require the Company (or the Surviving LLC) or either Parent
or any of its equity owners or its or their Affiliates to divest any assets, including generation assets, or take any other
action which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the

-51-

business, results of operations, financial condition of the Surviving LLC or on the benefits expected by Parents from the
Merger.

(c)      In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person is threatened or
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the
Parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such Proceeding and, if an injunction or
other order is issued in any such Proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted,
and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the Transactions.

(d)      From and after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable
best  efforts,  and  Parents  shall  reasonably  cooperate  with  the  Company,  to  obtain  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable
following  the  the  Effective  Date  the  Consents  from  third  parties  required  in  connection  with  the  consummation  of  the
Transactions  which  are  set  forth  in  Section  5.03(d)(i)  of  the  Disclosure  Schedules  or  such  other  amendments  in
connection  with  any  Lease  required  in  connection  with  the  consummation  of  the  Transactions  which  are  set  forth  in
Section 5.03(d)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules (each, a “ Third Party Consent ”). The Majority Member shall cooperate
with the Company in obtaining the Third Party Consents under this Section 5.03(d) . The Company shall bear the costs,
fees  and  expenses  (including  any  license  or  other  fees  and  expenses)  associated  with  obtaining  the  Third  Party
Consents and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including in  Section 5.03(a) ) all other third
party Consents required in connection with the Transactions; provided that, (i) with respect to the Tax Equity Documents
referenced  in  Section  5.03(d)(i)  of  the  Disclosure  Schedules,  the  costs,  fees  and  expenses  (including  any  license  or
other fees and expenses) associated with obtaining the Third Party Consents and all other third party Consents required
in connection with the Transaction or in connection with any waivers required in order to avoid the consummation of the
Transactions  from  resulting  in  a  breach  under  any  Tax  Equity  Document  or  in  connection  with  other  concessions  or
consents (other than indemnities, sureties, hold harmless and similar arrangements) requested, prior to consummation
of  and  in  connection  with  the  Transactions,  by  a  counterparty  thereto  in  connection  with  a  Tax  Equity  Document  in
connection with the Transactions (collectively, the “ Consent Fees ”) shall be allocated among the Parties as set forth on
Section  5.03(d)(ii)  of  the  Disclosure  Schedules;  and  (ii)  the  Company  shall  use  reasonable  best  efforts,  and  Parents
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company, to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
all of the Consents, waivers and concessions referenced in the immediately preceding clause (i). The Parties agree that
the Company shall be responsible for paying all Consent Fees at or prior to the Closing, and Parents shall satisfy their
obligation to share such Consent Fees by reducing Transaction Expenses by the

-52-

amount  of  Consent  Fees  for  which  Parents  have  responsibility  pursuant  to  this  Section  5.03(d)  .  The  Company  shall
consult with Parents and keep Parents reasonably informed of the status of all Third Party Consents and, with respect
thereto, the Company shall consult with Parents and, with respect to a Tax Equity Document, cooperate to reasonably
balance  in  good  faith  the  Consent  Fees  with  any  indemnification  obligations  requested  or  required  in  connection  with
obtaining such Third Party Consents. Prior to the Closing, Parents and their respective Affiliates shall not initiate lawsuits
against the Persons set forth on Section 5.3(d)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedules except in good faith and in connection
with  matters  unrelated  to  the  Transactions.  In  no  event  shall  the  Majority  Member  be  required  to  provide,  execute,
deliver  or  in  any  way  become  obligated  for,  an  indemnity,  hold  harmless,  surety  or  other  similar  instrument,  or
responsible  for  any  payments  under  any  of  the  foregoing  instruments  which  may  be  delivered  in  connection  with  any
indemnification obligations requested or required in connection with obtaining Third Party Consents or in connection with
any  waivers  required  in  order  to  avoid  the  consummation  of  the  Transactions  from  resulting  in  a  breach  under  a  Tax
Equity  Document  or  in  connection  with  other  concessions  or  consents  requested  in  connection  with  a  Tax  Equity
Document in connection with the Transactions.

(e)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality
of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 5.03 , each of the Company, Parents and Merger Subs agree to use their
reasonable  best  efforts  to  obtain  the  CFIUS  Clearance.  Such  reasonable  best  efforts  shall  include,  promptly  after  the
Effective Date, making or causing to be made any draft and final CFIUS Notices required in accordance with 31 C.F.R.
Part 800 and the other requirements of the DPA, and after prompt resolution of all questions and comments received
from CFIUS on such draft, preparing and submitting the final CFIUS Notice, which shall in any event be made promptly
after the date all questions and comments received from CFIUS on such draft have been resolved or after CFIUS staff
shall have indicated to the Parties that it has no questions or comments. Such reasonable best efforts shall also include
providing any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection with
the CFIUS review or investigation of the Transactions, within the time periods specified by 31 C.F.R. §800.403(a)(3), or
otherwise specified by the CFIUS staff, without the need to request an extension of time. Each of Parents and Merger
Subs, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts to obtain the CFIUS
Clearance: (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with the CFIUS Notice, including by
allowing the other Parties to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of any communication received by such Parties from, or given by such
Parties to, CFIUS, by promptly providing copies to the other Parties of any such written

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-53-

communications, except for any exhibits to such communications providing the personal identifying information required
by 31 C.F.R. §800.402(c)(6)(vi); and (iii) permit the other Parties to review in advance any communication that it gives
to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, telephone call or conference with CFIUS, and to the extent
not prohibited by CFIUS, give the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in any telephonic conferences or
in-person  meetings  with  CFIUS,  in  each  of  clauses  (i),  (ii)  and  (iii)  of  this  Section  5.03(e)  ,  subject  to  confidentiality
considerations  contemplated  by  the  DPA  or  required  by  CFIUS.  With  respect  to  Parents  and  Merger  Subs,  such
reasonable best efforts shall also include agreeing to any action, condition or restriction required by CFIUS in connection
with the CFIUS Clearance (including entering into any mitigation agreement with CFIUS as may be required) in order to
receive  the  CFIUS  Clearance  as  promptly  as  reasonably  practicable,  unless  (x)  the  Majority  Member  and  the  Parent
Representative have irrevocably waived the condition set forth in Section 6.01(c) prior to such date or (y) the terms of
such action, condition or restriction (including as required in any mitigation agreement with CFIUS) would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition of the Company,
the ability of Parent II (or any equityholder of Parent II) to participate in the management or governance of the Company
or the ability of Parent II (or any equityholder of Parent II) or Merger Sub II to access the Company (including without
limitation  access  to  the  Company’s  personnel,  facilities,  systems,  records,  data,  intellectual  property,  technology,
vendors  or  customers)  or  require  a  material  change  to,  or  cause  a  material  restriction  on,  the  businesses  of  any
equityholders  of  Parent  II  or  its  Affiliates.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
Agreement,  in  the  event  that  CFIUS  notifies  Parents  and  the  Company  that  CFIUS  (A)  has  completed  its  review  or
investigation  and  determined  it  has  unresolved  national  security  concerns  and  (B)  intends  to  send  a  report  to  the
President of the United States requesting the President’s decision because it either (1) recommends that the President
act  to  suspend  or  prohibit  the  Transactions,  (2)  is  unable  to  reach  a  decision  on  whether  to  recommend  that  the
President suspend or prohibit the Transactions, or (3) requests that the President make a determination with regard to
the Transactions (each of the events in clauses (1), (2) and (3), a “ CFIUS Turndown ”), the Majority Member and the
Parent  Representative  may  jointly  request  a  withdrawal  of  the  notice  filed  with  CFIUS  in  connection  with
the  CFIUS  Clearance  and  none  of  Parents,  Merger  Subs  or  the  Company  shall  have  any  further  obligation  to
seek  CFIUS  Clearance.  None  of  Parents,  Merger  Subs  or  the  Company  shall  take  or  permit  any  of  their  respective
Affiliates  to  take  any  action  that  would  reasonably  be  expected  to  prevent,  materially  delay  or  materially  impede  the
receipt of the CFIUS Clearance. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the  covenants  and  agreements  set  forth  in  this    Section  5.03(e)   constitute  the  sole  obligations  of  the  Parties  with
respect to the efforts required to obtain CFIUS Clearance.

Section  5.04.            Financial  Statements  .  Prior  to  the  Closing,  the  Company  shall  use  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  deliver  to  the  Parent  Representative  copies  of  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial
statements  (consisting  of  a  balance  sheet,  statement  of  income  and  statement  of  cash  flows),  including  the  related
footnotes, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the “ 2016 Audited Financial Statements ”) promptly upon
completion  of  such  2016  Audited  Financial  Statements;  provided  that  in  no  event  shall  a  failure  to  deliver,  or  to  use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, the 2016 Audited Financial Statements prior to the Closing in and of itself be
deemed a failure of any condition to Closing set forth in Article VI .

Section 5.05.      Expenses; Transfer Taxes .

(a)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, all costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the  negotiation,  execution  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Transaction  Documents  and  the
consummation of the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost, fee or expense, including all costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to Section 5.06 .

(b)      All sales Taxes, use Taxes, transfer Taxes, filing fees and similar Taxes, fees, charges and
expenses  (“  Transfer  Taxes  ”)  required  to  be  paid  in  connection  with  the  Transactions  shall  be  borne  by  Parents;
provided , however , that if the Transfer Taxes exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), Parents, on the one
hand,  and  the  Majority  Member  (including  from  the  Majority  Member  Reserve  Fund),  on  the  other  hand,  shall  share
equally  the  Transfer  Taxes  exceeding  such  threshold.  Each  Party  shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  avail
itself  of  any  available  exemptions  from  Transfer  Taxes,  and  to  cooperate  with  the  other  Parties  in  providing  any
information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

Consideration and the aggregate amount of any Liabilities treated as having been assumed by Parents for U.S.
Federal income Tax purposes as a result of the Merger (in each case, as determined under applicable income tax
principles)  (the  “  Consideration  ”)  among  the  assets  of  the  Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries  that  is
treated as a “flow through” for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes (the “ Preliminary Allocation

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-55-

Statement ”) in accordance with Sections 338, 755 and 1060 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

(ii)      If the Majority Member disagrees with the Preliminary Allocation Statement, then it shall deliver
a  notice  of  such  disagreement  to  the  Parent  Representative  within  fifteen  (15)  Business  Days  after  the  Parent
Representative’s  delivery  of  the  Preliminary  Allocation  Statement.  Any  such  notice  shall  specify  those  items  or
amounts as to which the Majority Member disagrees, and the Majority Member shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Preliminary Allocation Statement.

(iii)            After  delivery  of  a  notice  of  disagreement  pursuant  to  clause  (ii)  above,  the  Parent
Representative  and  the  Majority  Member  shall  negotiate,  in  good  faith,  for  ten  (10)  Business  Days  and  shall
endeavor  to  agree  on  all  otherwise  unagreed  items  or  amounts  with  respect  to  the  Preliminary  Allocation
Statement.

(iv)           If  the  Parent  Representative  and  the  Majority  Member  are  unable  to  agree  on  all  items  or
amounts pursuant to clause (iii) above, then the Parent Representative and the Majority Member shall submit to
an independent accounting firm (the “ Tax Matters Accounting Firm ”) for resolution all remaining disagreements
with  respect  to  the  Preliminary  Allocation  Statement.  The  Preliminary  Allocation  Statement  shall  be  revised  to
reflect  the  determinations  of  the  Tax  Matters  Accounting  Firm,  if  any,  together  with  items  and  amounts  as  to
which Majority Member and the Parent Representative had previously agreed (or were deemed to agree) (as so
revised, the “ Final Allocation Statement ”). The Tax Matters Accounting Firm shall be such nationally recognized
independent  public  accounting  firm  as  shall  be  agreed  upon  in  writing  by  the  Majority  Member  and  the  Parent
Representative (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(v)            In  resolving  matters  submitted  to  it  pursuant  to  this  Section  5.06(a)  ,  the  Tax  Matters

Accounting Firm (A) shall make its final determination on all matters within ninety (90) days of its appointment and
(B) with respect to each matter submitted to it, shall not resolve such matter in a manner that is more favorable
(x) to the Members than the notice of disagreement prepared by the Majority Member pursuant to clause (ii) or (y)
to Parents than the Preliminary Allocation Statement prepared by the Parent Representative. Only disputed items
shall  be  submitted  to  the  Tax  Matters  Accounting  Firm  for  review.  The  final  determination  by  the  Tax  Matters
Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to it pursuant to this Section 5.06(a)(v) shall (1) be in writing, (2) include
the  Tax  Matters  Accounting  Firm’s  calculations,  (3)  include  the  Tax  Matters  Accounting  Firm’s  determination  of
each

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-56-

matter  submitted  to  it  pursuant  to  Section  5.06(a)(iv)  and  (4)  include  a  brief  summary  of  the  Tax  Matters
Accounting Firm’s reasons for its determination of each issue. Judgment may be entered upon the determination
of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm in New York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over
the  party  against  which  such  determination  is  to  be  enforced.  The  fees  and  expenses  of  the  Tax  Matters
Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section 5.06(a) shall be borne by the Majority Member (including from
the  Majority  Member  Reserve  Fund),  on  the  one  hand,  and  Parents,  on  the  other  hand,  such  that  the  Majority
Member shall bear the costs in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items submitted to the Tax
Matters  Accounting  Firm  which  were  resolved  in  Parents’  favor  bears  to  the  total  amount  of  disputed  items
submitted  to  the  Tax  Matters  Accounting  Firm,  with  Parents  bearing  the  remainder,  if  any,  which  proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Tax
Matters  Accounting  Firm  is  rendered  on  the  merits  of  the  matters  submitted.  The  dispute  resolution  by  the  Tax
Matters  Accounting  Firm  under  this  Section 5.06(a) shall  constitute  an  arbitration  under  the  Federal  Arbitration
Act, and the determinations of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith
or manifest error.

(vi)      The Parties shall prepare their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation
Statement,  and  shall  not  take  a  contrary  position  on  any  other  Tax  Return,  in  any  audit  or  in  any  other
communication with any Taxing Authority, except as required by Applicable Law. The Parties shall cooperate to
adjust the Final Allocation Statement to reflect any adjustments made to the Consideration after the Closing.

(b)            Responsibility  for  Filing  Tax  Returns  .  The  Majority  Member  shall  prepare  or  cause  to  be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all tax periods
that end on or before the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all  Tax  Returns  for  the  Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries  for  any  Straddle  Period.  Parents  and  the  Company
shall permit the Majority Member to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence
prior  to  filing  and  shall  incorporate  such  revisions  to  such  Tax  Returns  as  are  reasonably  requested  by  the  Majority
Member. With respect to an income Tax Return for a Straddle Period, allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit shall be made using the closing of the books method pursuant to Section 706 of the Code.

-57-

against Tax to which Parents or the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries become entitled, that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the Members, and Parents shall pay over to the Majority Member (which
refunds  and  amounts  shall  be  allocated  among  the  Members,  other  than  the  MIP  if  the  Effective  Time  occurs  on  or
before  October  31,  2017,  taking  into  account  each  Member’s  Allocable  Share)  any  such  refund  or  the  amount  of  any
such credit (net of any Taxes of Parents, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries attributable to such refund
or credit) within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

(d)      Working Capital . If the amount included as a Current Liability in calculating Closing Working
Capital on account of all Taxes exceeds the actual liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for all Taxes,
Parents  shall  pay,  or  shall  cause  their  respective  Affiliates  to  pay,  to  the  Majority  Member  the  amount  of  any  such
excess  (which  excess  shall  be  allocated  among  the  Members  taking  into  account  each  Member’s  Allocable  Share)
within ten (10) Business Days after any such excess arises.

(e)      Cooperation . The Parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause the Company and the
Company  Subsidiaries  and  their  respective  officers,  employees,  agents,  auditors  and  representatives  reasonably  to
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(f)      Adjustment . The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.09 (except
to the extent attributable to interest) as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law or a final determination by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm thereunder.

(g)      Straddle Periods . In any case under this Agreement involving a Tax period that includes (but
does  not  end  on)  the  Closing  Date  (a  “  Straddle Period  ”),  (i)  real,  personal  and  intangible  property  taxes  (“  Property
Taxes  ”)  for  the  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  shall  be  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  Property  Taxes  for  the  entire  Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ( provided , however
, that for the purposes of apportioning such Straddle Period Property Taxes the effective date of any adjustment to the
rate,  taxability,  exemption,  or  other  change  upon  which  such  Property  Taxes  are  computed  shall  be  respected);  and
(ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity
interest in any partnership or other “flowthrough” entity or “controlled foreign corporation” (within the meaning of Section
957(a) of the Code or any comparable

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-58-

Applicable Law), as if the taxable period of such partnership, other “flowthrough” entity or “controlled foreign corporation”
ended  as  of  the  close  of  business  on  the  Closing  Date  (whether  or  not  such  Taxes  arise  in  a  Straddle  Period  of  the
applicable owner).

(h)      Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections .  Parents shall not, and shall not cause or permit

ending  on  or before  the  Closing  Date  or with  respect  to  any  Straddle  Period, (ii)  make  or  change  any Tax  election  or
accounting  method  or  practice  with  respect  to,  or  that  has  retroactive  effect  to,  any  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  or  to  any

Parent by reason of Applicable Law (including any Competition Law), as determined by the Company’s legal counsel, (ii)
which  in  the  opinion  of  legal  counsel  to  the  Company  will  result  in  the  loss  of  attorney/client  privilege,  (iii)  which  the
Majority Member or the Company is required to keep confidential or prevent access to by reason of any agreement or
obligation  of  confidentiality  with  a  third  party  or  (iv)  relating  to  pricing  or  other  matters  that  are  highly  sensitive  if  the
exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by the Company’s legal counsel, might
reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for the Majority Member or its Affiliates; provided that the Parties will cooperate
to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, or seek appropriate waivers or consents, under circumstances
in  which  the  restrictions  of  clause  (i)  of  this  sentence  apply.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  all  information  provided
pursuant to this Section 5.09(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

manager  or  officer  of  the  Company  or  the  Company  Subsidiaries,  in  each  case,  as  provided  in  the  Organizational
Documents  of  the  Company  or  the  Company  Subsidiaries  as  of  the  date  hereof,  shall  survive  the  Closing  Date  for  a
period of six (6) years and shall continue in full force and

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-64-

subsidiaries shall not (and Parents shall cause the Surviving LLC and its subsidiaries not to) amend, repeal or otherwise
modify  the  Charter  Documents  of  the  Surviving  LLC  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  for  a  period  of  six  (6)  years  after  the
Effective  Time  in  any  manner  that  would  cause  the  indemnification  of  and  advancement  of  expenses  of  former  or
present managers and officers of the Company to be less favorable than those contained in the Charter Documents of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

(b)            Prior  to  the  Closing,  the  Majority  Member  may  cause  the  Company  to,  at  the  Majority

shall be express intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.11 , each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
Section 5.11 .

merge or consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the surviving or continuing Person in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or a series of related
transactions to any Person, then in each such case, Parents shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause proper
provision  to  be  made  so  that  the  successor  or  assign  of  the  applicable  Parent  or  the  Company,  as  the  case  may  be,
shall assume in writing the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11 .

Section 5.12.      Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations . During the period from

the Effective Date until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,

leverage  lender,  landlord,  construction  counterparty,  supplier,  distributor,  Material  Contract  counterparty,  or  other
material  business  relation  of  the  Company  or  any  Company  Subsidiary  regarding  the  Company  or  any  Company
Subsidiary,  its  business  or  the  Transactions  without  the  prior  consent  of  the  Majority  Member.  For  the  avoidance  of
doubt, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement

Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Majority Member

negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into
any  written  agreements  or  other  instruments  regarding  an  Acquisition  Proposal  or  (iv)  provide  any  information  to  any
Person (other than Parents or any of their respective Affiliates) regarding an Acquisition. The Company and the Majority
Member  shall  immediately  cease  and  cause  to  be  terminated,  and  shall  cause  their  representatives  to  immediately
cease  and  cause  to  be  terminated,  all  existing  discussions  or  negotiations  with  any  Persons  conducted  prior  to  the
Effective  Date with  respect to,  or that  could lead  to,  an Acquisition  Proposal. The  Company and  the Majority  Member
shall promptly after the Effective Date request all Persons who have executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with  such  persons’  consideration  of  an  Acquisition  to  return  or  destroy  all  confidential  information  furnished  to  such
Persons by or on behalf of the Majority Member or the Company or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Company or
the  Company  Subsidiaries  in  accordance  with  such  confidentiality  agreement,  and  will  use  commercially  reasonable
efforts  to  enforce  all  material  obligations  under  such  confidentiality  agreements.  For  purposes  hereof,  “  Acquisition
Proposal ” shall mean any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) from any Person (other than Parents or

other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s or any material Company Subsidiary’s properties or assets
(an “ Acquisition ”). For purposes of clarity, any single or series of related or unrelated tax equity, sale-leaseback, back-
leverage  or  other  construction  financing  or  refinancing  transactions  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  whether  they
include  Indebtedness,  Equity  Interests  or  any  convertible,  exercisable  or  exchangeable  derivative  or  combination
thereof, shall not be deemed to be an Acquisition Proposal.

reasonably cooperate with Parents in obtaining the Updated Title Work and the Title Policies provided that in no event
shall Parents’ ability to obtain Updated Title Work or Title Policies, or any portion thereof, be a condition to Closing and
in no event shall the failure to obtain Updated Title Work or Title Policies, or any portion thereof, be a Company Material
Adverse  Effect.  The  Company  and  each  Company  Subsidiaries  shall  deliver  to  the  Title  Company  the  Title
Documentation  and  shall  not  be  required  to  execute  and  deliver  documents  to  a  Title  Company  other  than  the  Title
Documentation, or to incur any material cost or expense in connection with the delivery of the Title Documentation.

Section 5.16.      R&W Policy . On or prior to the Closing Date, each Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to procure the R&W Policy on terms no less favorable to Parents and their Affiliates as the terms set forth in the

R&W Policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parents shall be solely responsible for all costs
and  expenses  associated  with  or  payable  in  connection  with  obtaining  and  pursuing  coverage  under  the  R&W  Policy.
The  Company  shall  reasonably  cooperate  with  Parents  and  the  applicable  insurance  provider  in  connection  with
obtaining  the  R&W  Policy;  provided  that  the  failure  of  such  policy  to  issue  shall  not  be  deemed  a  breach  of  such
obligation of the Company. Parents shall cause the R&W Policy to contain, at all times, a provision pursuant to which the
insurers thereunder

shall waive any right of subrogation they may have against the Majority Member arising under this Agreement other than
in cases of fraud or willful misconduct. Each Parent further agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will consent to
amend any such provision in the R&W Policy without the express written consent of the Majority Member.

(d)            For  purposes  of  calculating  the  dollar  amounts  of  Losses  (other  than  the  dollar  amount  of
Losses  with  respect  to  any  breach  of  the  representations  and  warranties  set  forth  in  Section  2.06(a)  ),  to  which  an
Indemnified Purchaser Entity is entitled pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) , such representation, warranty or covenant shall
not  be  deemed  qualified  or  limited  by,  and  each  of  the  following  shall  be  disregarded,  any  “material,”  “materially,”
“materiality,” “Company Material Adverse Effect,” “Majority Member Material Adverse Effect” or other similar materiality
qualification or limitation.

(e)            Parents  acknowledge  and  confirm  that  the  Indemnified  Purchaser  Entities  shall  solely  be
entitled  to  indemnification  pursuant  to  Section  8.02(a)(i)  in  excess  of  the  Retention  Amount  if  Parents  procure  the
effective  R&W  Policy  at  or  prior  to  the  Closing  and  that  all  Indemnified  Purchaser  Entities  who  may  be  entitled  to
indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(i) shall be entitled to recover any such Losses from the Majority Member only until
the  aggregate  amount  of  all  such  Losses  (taking  into  account  the  amount  of  the  Threshold)  is  equal  to  the  Retention
Amount;  provided  ,  however  ,  once  the  Retention  Amount  has  been  paid  or  satisfied  completely,  all  Indemnified
Purchaser  Entities  shall  be  solely  entitled  to  seek  or  obtain  recovery  from  the  R&W  Policy  in  relation  to  Losses  or
indemnification  claims  under  Section  8.02(a)(i)  ,  without  any  right  to  recover  from  the  Majority  Member  (or  any  other
Member), except, however, with respect to the Majority Member, for Losses arising out of claims based upon or arising
out of fraud or any willful misconduct of the Majority Member or the Company, to the extent occurring on or prior to the
Closing. Neither the pendency of a claim, the failure to obtain recovery nor the

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-78-

unavailability of coverage under the R&W Policy, regardless of the reason therefor, shall result in the Majority Member
becoming liable to make an indemnification payment under Section 8.02(a)(i) once the Retention Amount has been paid
or satisfied completely.

(f)           Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  Agreement:  (i)  to  the  extent  that
Losses to which an Indemnified Purchaser Entity is entitled to indemnification hereunder also constitute an indemnifiable
matter  under  any  prior  acquisition  agreement,  such  Indemnified  Purchaser  Entity  will  use  reasonable  best  efforts  to
obtain  indemnification  under  such  prior  acquisition  agreement  and  (ii)  any  amounts  recovered  under  such  prior
acquisition agreement with respect to a Loss shall reduce, dollar for dollar, the amount owed by the Majority Member
hereunder. Each Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate
any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto.

(g)      This Section 8.02 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.01(b) .

Section 8.03.      Indemnification by Parents and Merger Subs .

(a)      From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII , Parents
and Merger Subs agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify the Members and their respective Affiliates, and each of
their respective managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively,
the “ Indemnified  Seller  Entities  ”)  and  to  hold  each  of  them  harmless  from  and  against,  any  and  all  Losses  suffered,
paid  or  incurred  by  any  such  Indemnified  Seller  Entity  (whether  directly,  pursuant  to  a  claim  by  a  Third  Party  or
otherwise) and arising out of or related to any:

(i)           breach  of  any  of  the  representations  and  warranties  made  by  Parents  and  Merger  Subs  in

Article IV ; and

(ii)          breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Parents or Merger Subs contained in this

Agreement.

Entities shall be entitled to indemnification:

(b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.03 , the Indemnified Seller

(i)            with  respect  to  any  claim  for  indemnification  pursuant  to  Section  8.03(a)(i)  ,  only  if  the

aggregate  amount  of  Losses  to  all  Indemnified  Seller  Entities  with  respect  to  all  such  claims  exceeds  the
Threshold, and thereafter the Indemnified

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-79-

Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification only for amounts in excess of the Threshold; and

(ii)           only  if  such  claims  are  made  on  or  before  the  expiration  of  the  survival  period  pursuant  to

Section 8.01 for the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c)           Notwithstanding  anything to  the  contrary contained  in  this  Agreement, in  no  event shall  the
Indemnified Seller Entities be entitled in the aggregate to recover Losses in excess of the Cap;  provided that the Cap
shall  not  apply  to  the  Parent  Fundamental  Representations  or  in  the  case  of  fraud  or  willful  misconduct;  provided  ,
further  ,  that  in  no  event  shall  the  Indemnified  Seller  Entities  be  entitled  to  recover  aggregate  Losses  under  this
Agreement in excess of four hundred twenty-six million five hundred thousand dollars ($426,500,000).

(d)      For purposes of calculating the dollar amounts of Losses to which an Indemnified Seller Entity
is  entitled  pursuant  to  Section 8.03(a)(i)  ,  such  representation,  warranty  or  covenant  shall  not  be  deemed  qualified  or
limited  by,  and  each  of  the  following  shall  be  disregarded,  any  “material,”  “materially,”  “materiality,”  “Parent  Material
Adverse Effect,” or other similar materiality qualification or limitation.

(e)      This Section 8.03 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.01(b) .

Section 8.04.      Indemnification Procedures .

(a)      If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an “ Indemnified Entity
”) believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise
to  a  right  of  indemnification  under  this  Article  VIII  (whether  or  not  the  amount  of  Losses  relating  thereto  is  then
quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a “ Claim
Notice ”) to the party from which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 , as applicable (the
party from which indemnification is sought, the “ Indemnifying Entity ”) (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim brought by a Person not a Party or affiliated with any such Party (a “
Third Party ”), within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of written notice of such claim by such Indemnified Entity,
or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim brought
by a Third Party, as promptly as practicable after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise
to such claim for indemnity; provided that, in each case in clauses (i) and (ii), the failure to notify or delay in notifying the
Indemnifying Entity will

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-80-

not  relieve  the  Indemnifying  Entity  of  its  obligations  pursuant  to  this  Article  VIII  ,  except  to  the  extent  that  such
Indemnifying Entity is materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim and the basis
of such claim in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no claim for
indemnification  arising  out  of  a  claim  relating  to  Taxes  may  be  asserted  unless  (x)  a  Third  Party  has  actually
commenced a lawsuit, action or regulatory proceeding or issued a written notice of proposed adjustment, assessment or
deficiency,  in  each  case,  with  respect  to  the  specific  matters  addressed  in  such  claim  and  (y)  such  claim  for
indemnification is made in respect of Losses actually realized in connection with the claim by such Third Party.

(b)      Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a claim brought by a
Third Party, the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to (i) assume and have sole control over the defense of such claim
at  its sole  cost  and expense  (subject  to  the last  sentence  of this  Section 8.04(b) ) and with its own counsel if it gives
notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Entity within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Entity; provided that (A) the Indemnifying Entity’s retention of counsel shall be subject to the written consent
of the Indemnified Entity if such counsel creates a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional conduct
or an unreasonable risk of disclosure of confidential information concerning an Indemnified Entity, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed and (B) the Indemnifying Entity shall not be entitled to assume
and  have  control  over  such  defense  if  such  claim  arises  in  connection  with  a  criminal  proceeding  (  provided that the
Indemnifying  Entity  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in  such  defense,  with  counsel  reasonably  acceptable  to  the
Indemnified  Entity,  at  such  Indemnifying  Entity’s  sole  cost  and  expense)  or  if  the  Indemnified  Entity  shall  have  been
advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entity
in connection with the defense of such Third Party claim; and (ii) negotiate a settlement or compromise of such claim;
provided that unless (A) such settlement or compromise (1) includes a full and unconditional waiver and release by the
Third  Party  of  all  applicable  Indemnified  Entities  without  any  cost  or  liability  of  any  nature  whatsoever  to  such
Indemnified Entities, (2) does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or admission of any
wrongdoing  by  the  Indemnified  Entity  and  (3)  does  not  result  in  any  Lien  on  any  of  the  assets  of,  or  contain  any
restriction  or  condition  that  would  affect  the  future  conduct  of,  the  Indemnified  Entity  or  its  Affiliates  and  (B)  the
Indemnifying Entity shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts of such settlement or compromise concurrently with the
effectiveness thereof, such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the
Indemnified Entity. If, within thirty (30) days after receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a
Third  Party  action  or  claim,  the  Indemnifying  Entity  (i)  advises  such  Indemnified  Entity  in  writing  that  the  Indemnifying
Entity does not

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

-81-

elect to defend, settle or compromise such claim, (ii) is not entitled to assume and control the defense of such claim or
(iii) fails to make such an election in writing, then such Indemnified Entity may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwise
compromise or pay such claim; provided that any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with
the  written  consent  of  the  Indemnifying  Entity,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  or
delayed. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the Indemnifying Entity all information reasonably available to
such Indemnified Entity relating to such claim, except as may be prohibited by Applicable Law. In addition, the Parties
shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of any such claim. The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at all times as
to  the  status  of  the  defense  or  any  settlement  negotiations  with  respect  thereto.  If  the  Indemnifying  Entity  elects  to
defend  any  such  claim,  then  the  Indemnified  Entity  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in  such  defense  with  counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity at such Indemnified Entity’s sole cost and expense. In the event the
Indemnifying Entity assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or compromise) any such claim,
the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Entity in connection with such defense (or negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such
costs and expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining Threshold; provided that such costs and expenses shall
be included in the calculation of the Threshold.

(c)      An Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to make claims for indemnification with respect to losses
arising out of or resulting from, or amounts payable with respect to, the matters set forth in Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 ,
as applicable; it being understood that in the event an Indemnified Entity shall have timely delivered notice of any claim
pursuant to this Section 8.04 , such claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved.

Section 8.05.      Indemnification Generally .

(a)           The  amount  which  the  Indemnifying  Entity  is  or  may  be  required  to  pay  to  any  Indemnified
Entity  pursuant  to  this  Article  VIII  shall  be  reduced  (retroactively,  if  necessary)  by  any  insurance  proceeds  or  other
amounts  actually  recovered  by  or  on  behalf  of  such  Indemnified  Entity  related  to  the  related  Losses  (for  purposes  of
clarity, this Section 8.05(a) is not intended to apply to the R&W Policy). If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the
payment  required  by  this  Agreement  from  the  Indemnifying  Entity  in  respect  of  Losses  (including  any  Merger
Consideration adjustment with respect to the circumstances giving rise to such payment under this Article VIII ) and shall
subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Losses, then such Indemnified Entity shall
promptly  repay  to  the  Indemnifying  Entity  a  sum  equal  to  the  amount  of  such  insurance  proceeds  or  other  amounts
actually received. Furthermore, the amount of any Losses that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (other than
Losses  that  are  subject  to  Section  8.02(a)(i)  (other  than  respect  to  any  Company  Fundamental  Representations  and
Majority  Member  Representations)  and  Section  8.03(a)(i)  (other  than  respect
 Fundamental
Representations)) will be net of any Tax benefits actually realized by any Indemnified Entity as a result of Tax benefits
associated with the circumstances giving rise to the indemnification.

 to  any  Parent

(b)      Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by Section 8.05(a) ,
the Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other
Person with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

(c)          The indemnification provided in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing
remedy available to any Party with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement,  or  otherwise  in  respect  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  except  in  the  case  of  willful

misconduct or fraud by such Party.

(d)      All Losses shall be determined without duplication of recovery under other provisions of this
Agreement  or  any  other  document  or  agreement  delivered  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  and  Losses  shall  not
include any amounts that were included in the calculation of Working Capital. Without limiting the generality of the prior
sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation under this Article VIII , only one recovery of Losses shall be
allowed,  and  in  no  event  shall  there  be  any  indemnification  or  duplication  of  payments  or  recovery  under  different
provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same facts, conditions or events.

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

Section 1.09 shall not be considered Losses for purposes of this Article VIII .

(e)      For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Merger Consideration pursuant to

(f)      The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this Article VIII as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or a final determination by
the Tax Matters Accounting Firm thereunder.

(g)      Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, other than with respect
to  indemnification  pursuant  to  Section  8.02(a)(i)  and  Section  8.03(a)(i)  ,  no  Party  shall  be  liable  for  special,  punitive,
exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages, lost profits or Losses calculated by reference to any multiple
of earnings or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation or amortization (or any other valuation methodology), whether
based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Applicable Law or otherwise and whether or not arising from the other Party’s
sole,  joint  or  concurrent  negligence,  strict  liability  or  other  fault  for  any  matter  relating  to  this  Agreement  and  the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to claims brought by any Third
Party for which any Indemnifying Entity is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Entity hereunder.

Section 8.06.      Escrow; Indemnification Payments .

(a)      Any payment that the Majority Member is obligated to make pursuant to Section 8.02(a) shall
be  paid,  to  the  extent  that  there  are  sufficient  funds  in  the  Escrow  Account,  by  release  of  funds  to  the  applicable
Indemnified Purchaser Entity from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date
that  notice  of  any  such  amounts  due  and  owing  is  given  in  accordance  with  the  Escrow  Agreement.  For  purpose  of
clarity, the Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery for the Indemnified Purchaser Entities for payments from
the Majority Member pursuant to Section 8.02(a) , other than in the event of any fraud or willful misconduct.

(b)      If applicable, on the date that is one (1) Business Day after the twelve (12) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release an amount, if any, equal to the then current balance of the Escrow
Account, minus the  aggregate amount of all claims  for indemnification by the Indemnified  Purchaser Entities asserted
prior to such date but not yet resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “ Unresolved Claims
”). The balance in the Escrow Account with respect to any Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent
upon the resolution of any such Unresolved Claims in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c)      Any payment that Parents are obligated to make pursuant to this Article VIII shall be paid to
the applicable Indemnified Seller Entities by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days
after such Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Entity or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII .

each  acted  as  legal  counsel  to  the  Company,  the  Company  Subsidiaries,  the  Majority  Member  and  certain  of  the

intend to act as legal counsel to the Majority Member and its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parents, the

Company  Subsidiaries  to  waive,  any  conflicts  that  may  arise  in  connection  with  Lowenstein  Sandler  LLP  and/or  Stoel
Rives LLP representing the Majority Member or its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to the
Company  or  the  Company  Subsidiaries  or  the  Transactions.  In  addition,  all  communications  involving  attorney-client
confidences between the Majority Member, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates,

engagement with respect to negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Majority Member and its Affiliates (and not the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not have the right to obtain
access  to  any  such  communications  or  to  the  files  of  Lowenstein  Sandler  LLP  or  Stoel  Rives  LLP  relating  to  such
engagement from and after the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing
Date, (a) the Majority Member and its Affiliates (and not the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall be the sole
holders  of  the  attorney-client  privilege  with  respect  to  such  engagement,  and  none  of  the  Company  or  the  Company
Subsidiaries  shall  be  a  holder  thereof,  (b)  to  the  extent  that  files  of  Lowenstein  Sandler  LLP  or  Stoel  Rives  LLP  in
respect  of  such  engagement  constitute  property  of  the  client,  only  the  Majority  Member  and  its  Affiliates  (and  not  the
Company  and  the  Company  Subsidiaries)  shall  hold  such  property  rights  and  (c)  neither  Lowenstein  Sandler  LLP  nor
Stoel Rives LLP shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to

Sandler LLP or Stoel Rives LLP and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise. This Section 9.13
shall  be  irrevocable,  and  no  term  of  this  Section 9.13 may  be  amended,  waived  or  modified,  without  the  prior  written
consent of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, as it relates to itself, and Stoel Rives LLP, as it relates to itself.

Member  in  its  capacity  as  the  Majority  Member  hereunder  and  may  be  used  by  the  Majority  Member  to  pay  the
Deficiency Amount or other amounts owed under this Agreement, if any. Once the Majority Member determines, in its
sole reasonable discretion, that the Majority Member will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as the Majority
Member  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  and  the  Transactions  and  will  not  incur  any  further  obligation  to  pay  any
Deficiency  Amount,  then  the  Majority  Member  will  distribute  the  remaining  unused  Majority  Member  Reserve  Fund,  if
any, to the Members who have delivered to the Majority Member

waiving party or by the Parent Representative.

(b)      The Parent Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents
