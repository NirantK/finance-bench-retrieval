Salesforce Completes Acquisition of Slack

Together, Salesforce and Slack are creating the digital HQ for success from anywhere

SAN FRANCISCO, July 21, 2021—Salesforce
(NYSE:
CRM),
the
global
leader
in
CRM,
today
announced
it
has
completed
its
acquisition
of
Slack
Technologies,
Inc.

“We
couldn’t
be
more
excited
to
have
Slack
as
part
of
the
Salesforce
family,
combining
the
#1
CRM
and
the
trailblazing
digital
platform
for
the
work
anywhere
world,”
said Marc
Benioff,
Chair
and
CEO
of
Salesforce.
“Together
we’ll
define
the
future
of
enterprise
software,
creating
the
digital
HQ
that
enables
every
organization
to
deliver
customer
and
employee
success
from
anywhere.”

“We’ve
learned
over
the
past
year
that
the
workplace
isn’t
snapping
back
to
the
way
it
was,”
said
Bret
Taylor,
President
and
Chief
Operating
Officer
of
Salesforce.
“Together,
Slack
and
Salesforce
Customer
360
will
give
every
company
in
the
world
a
single
source
of
truth
for
their
business
and
a
single
platform
for
connecting
employees,
customers,
and
partners
with
each
other
and
the
apps
they
use
every
day.”

“We
have
a
once-in-a-generation
opportunity
to
rethink
and
reshape
how
and
where
we
work,”
said
Stewart
Butterfield,
Slack
CEO
and
Co-Founder.
“Salesforce
and
Slack
are
uniquely
positioned
to
lead
this
historic
shift
to
a
digital-first
world.
I
could
not
be
more
excited
for
what’s
to
come.”

“We
are
obsessed
with
continually
delighting
our
clients,
and
offering
them
the
best
experience
and
value
across
every
interaction,”
said
Arvind
Krishna,
Chairman
and
CEO
of
IBM.
“Salesforce
and
Slack
coming
together
will
help
us
become
more
connected,
more
productive,
and
more
innovative
so
we
can
better
serve
our
clients.”

Acquisition to Create the Digital HQ for Success from Anywhere

Companies
around
the
world
have
learned
one
thing
over
the
past
year—if
you
don’t
have
a
digital
way
to
connect
with
your
employees,
customers,
and
partners,
you
don’t
have
much
of
a
chance
of
surviving.

Headquarters
are
no
longer
on
Madison
Avenue
or
Main
Street—they
are
in
the
cloud.
Every
business—in
every
industry—has
to
optimize
for
a
digital-first
customer,
employee,
and
partner
experience.

This
is
a
once-in-a-generation
opportunity
to
rethink
and
reshape
everything
about
how
and
where
we
work.
That’s
exactly
what
the
combination
of
Salesforce
and
Slack
is
all
about—creating
the
business
operating
system
for
the
new
world
of
work.

With
the
world’s
#1
CRM,
companies
can
sell,
service,
market,
conduct
commerce,
and
more
from
anywhere.
Slack
has
transformed
the
way
we
work
with
its
trailblazing
digital
platform
for
business
communication,
which
is
used
by
millions
of
people
around
the
world
and
enables
entire
organizations
to
work
far
more
efficiently
and
effortlessly.

Together,
Salesforce
and
Slack
will
deliver
the
Slack-first
Customer
360
that
gives
companies
a
single
source
of
truth
for
their
business,
and
a
single
platform
for
connecting
employees,
customers,
and
partners
with
each
other
and
the
apps
they
use
every
day,
all
within
their
existing
workflows.

The
combination
of
Salesforce
and
Slack
also
brings
together
two
of
the
software
industry’s
most
dynamic
communities,
creating
an
open
and
extensive
ecosystem
that
will
deliver
the
next
generation
of
digital-first
apps
and
workflows
for
business.

“Salesforce
will
create
a
modern
workspace
that
enables
collaboration,
communities,
communications,
CRM
functionality,
customer
experience,
and
AI
in
an
ecosystem
that
will
welcome
other
integrations
to
extend
enterprise
functionality,”
said Wayne Kurtzman, IDC Research Director for Social,
Communities, and Collaboration.

Salesforce
and
Slack
are
already
making
a
huge
difference.
IBM’s
380,000
employees
are
working
together
in
Slack,
with
numerous
workflows
across
Salesforce
Sales
Cloud
and
Service
Cloud
powering
customer
success
across
locations
and
time
zones.

As
part
of
Salesforce,
Slack
will
be
positioned
to
accelerate
and
extend
its
mission
to
make
work
life
simpler,
more
pleasant,
and
more
productive.
Slack
will
continue
to
operate
under
the
Slack
brand,
driving
forward
a
continued
focus
on
its
mission,
customers,
and
community.
Slack
will
continue
to
be
led
by
CEO
and
Co-Founder
Stewart
Butterfield.

On
Tuesday,
August
17,
10:00
a.m.
PT/1:00
p.m.
ET/6:00
p.m.
BST,
Salesforce
President
and
COO
Bret
Taylor
and
Slack
CEO
and
Co-Founder
Stewart
Butterfield
will
host
an
event
to
share
more
about
how
the
two
companies
are
creating
a
powerful
platform
for
the
digital-first,
work
anywhere
world.
