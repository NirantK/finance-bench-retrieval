PART I

ITEM 1 - Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW

For more than 150 years, General Mills has been making food the world loves. We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of
branded consumer foods with more than 100 brands in 100 countries across six continents. In addition to our consolidated operations,
we  have  50  percent  interests  in  two  strategic  joint  ventures  that  manufacture  and  market  food  products  sold  in  approximately  130
countries worldwide.

We manage and review the financial results of our business under four operating segments: North America Retail; International; Pet;
and  North  America  Foodservice.  See  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations
(MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.

We offer a variety of human and pet food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the
world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories:

snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;
ready-to-eat cereal;
convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;

•
•
•
•  wholesome natural pet food;
•
•
•
•

refrigerated and frozen dough;
baking mixes and ingredients;
yogurt; and
super-premium ice cream.

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets
outside North America, and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in
Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 of this report.

The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.

Customers
Our  primary  customers  are  grocery  stores,  mass  merchandisers,  membership  stores,  natural  food  chains,  drug,  dollar  and  discount
chains, e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores,
and  pet  specialty  stores.  We  generally  sell  to  these  customers  through  our  direct  sales  force.  We  use  broker  and  distribution
arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers and certain markets. For further information on our customer
credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During
fiscal 2023, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales
of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further
information on significant customers, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Competition
The human and pet food categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories
are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-
mortar stores and e-commerce. All our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition
in  our  product  categories  is  based  on  product  innovation,  product  quality,  price,  brand  recognition  and  loyalty,  effectiveness  of
marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences.  Our  principal  strategies  for  competing  in  each  of  our  segments  include  unique  consumer  insights,  effective  customer
relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs,
an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products,
but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we
compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.

4

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging
The  principal  raw  materials  that  we  use  are  grains  (wheat,  oats,  and  corn),  dairy  products,  meat,  vegetable  oils,  sugar,  vegetables,
fruits,  nuts,  and  other  agricultural  products.  We  also  use  substantial  quantities  of  carton  board,  corrugated,  plastic,  and  metal
packaging  materials,  operating  supplies,  and  energy.  Most  of  these  inputs  for  our  domestic  and  Canadian  operations  are  purchased
from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may
be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate
change,  product  scarcity,  limited  sources  of  supply,  commodity  market  fluctuations,  currency  fluctuations,  trade  tariffs,  pandemics,
war,  and  changes  in  governmental  agricultural  and  energy  policies  and  regulations.  We  believe  that  we  will  be  able  to  obtain  an
adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business
in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production
needs  at  price  levels  that  allow  a  targeted  profit  margin.  Since  these  inputs  generally  represent  the  largest  variable  cost  in
manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs
using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and
more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that
are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Our  products  are  marketed  under  a  variety  of  valuable  trademarks.  Some  of  the  more  important  trademarks  used  in  our  global
operations  (set  forth  in  italics  in  this  report)  include  Annie’s,  Betty  Crocker,  Bisquick,  Blue  Buffalo,  Blue  Basics,  Blue  Freedom,
Bugles, Cascadian Farm, Cheerios, Chex, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Cocoa Puffs, Cookie Crisp, EPIC, Fiber One, Fruit by the Foot,
Fruit  Gushers,  Fruit  Roll-Ups,  Gardetto's,  Gold  Medal,  Golden  Grahams,  Häagen-Dazs,  Kitano,  Kix,  Lärabar,  Latina,  Lucky
Charms, Muir Glen, Nature Valley, Nudges, Oatmeal Crisp, Old El Paso, Pillsbury, Progresso, Raisin Nut Bran, Total, Top Chews
Naturals,  Totino’s,  Trix,  True  Chews,  Wanchai  Ferry,  Wheaties,  Wilderness,  and  Yoki.  We  protect  these  trademarks  as  appropriate
through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long
as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of
trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.

Some  of  our  products  are  marketed  under  or  in  combination  with  trademarks  that  have  been  licensed  from  others  for  both  long-
standing products (e.g., Reese’s Puffs for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries, and Yoplait and related brands for
fresh dairy in the United States and Canada), and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party
equities).

Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé trademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its
trademarks  to  CPW,  including  the  Nestlé  and  Uncle  Toby’s  trademarks.  The  Häagen-Dazs  trademark  is  licensed  royalty-free  and
exclusively to Nestlé and authorized sublicensees for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada.
The Häagen-Dazs trademark is also licensed to HDJ in Japan. The Pillsbury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy character are subject
to an exclusive, royalty-free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in
the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico.

We  continue  our  focus  on  developing  and  marketing  innovative,  proprietary  products,  many  of  which  use  proprietary  expertise,
recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset,
but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

SEASONALITY

In  general,  demand  for  our  products  is  evenly  balanced  throughout  the  year.  However,  within  our  North  America  Retail  segment
demand  for  refrigerated  dough,  frozen  baked  goods,  and  baking  products  is  stronger  in  the  fourth  calendar  quarter.  Demand  for
Progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Within our International segment, demand for Häagen-Dazs ice cream is
higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these
demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our International segment’s net sales are
generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The  manufacture  and  sale  of  human  and  pet  food  products  is  highly  regulated.  In  the  United  States,  our  activities  are  subject  to
regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal
Trade  Commission,  Department  of  Commerce,  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration,  and  Environmental  Protection
Agency,  as  well  as  various  federal,  state,  and  local  agencies  relating  to  the  production,  packaging,  labelling,  marketing,  storage,
distribution, quality, and safety of food and pet products and the health and safety of our employees. Our business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As  of  May  28,  2023,  we  were  involved  with  two  response  actions  associated  with  the  alleged  or  threatened  release  of  hazardous
substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.

Our  operations  are  subject  to  the  Clean  Air  Act,  Clean  Water  Act,  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act,  Comprehensive
Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability  Act,  and  the  Federal  Insecticide,  Fungicide,  and  Rodenticide  Act,  and  all
similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in
general  with  environmental  laws  or  regulations  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect  upon  our  capital  expenditures,  earnings,  or
competitive position.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Recruiting, developing, engaging, and protecting our workforce is critical to executing our strategy and achieving business success. As
of  May  28,  2023,  we  had  approximately  34,000  employees  around  the  globe,  with  approximately  16,000  in  the  U.S.  and
approximately 18,000 located in our markets outside of the U.S. Our workforce is divided between approximately 13,000 employees
dedicated to the production of our products and approximately 21,000 non-production employees.

The  efficient  production  of  high-quality  products  and  successful  execution  of  our  strategy  requires  a  talented,  skilled,  and  engaged
team of employees. We work to equip our employees with critical skills and expand their contributions over time by providing a range
of training and career development opportunities, including hands-on experiences via challenging work assignments and job rotations,
coaching and mentoring opportunities, and training programs. To foster employee engagement and commitment, we follow a robust
process  to  listen  to  employees,  take  action,  and  measure  our  progress  with  on-going  employee  conversations,  transparent
communications, and employee engagement surveys.

We believe that fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging strengthens our ability to recruit talent and allows all of our employees
to thrive and succeed. We actively cultivate a culture that acknowledges, respects, and values all dimensions of diversity – including
gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, backgrounds, and beliefs. Ensuring diversity of input and perspectives is core to our business
strategy,  and  we  are  committed  to  recruiting,  retaining,  developing,  and  advancing  a  workforce  that  reflects  the  diversity  of  the
consumers we serve. This commitment starts with our company leadership where women represent approximately 47 percent of our
officer  and  director  population,  and  approximately  22  percent  of  our  officers  and  directors  are  racially  or  ethnically  diverse.  We
embed our culture of inclusion and belonging into our day-to-day ways of working through a number of programs to foster discussion,
build empathy, and increase understanding.

We  are  committed  to  maintaining  a  safe  and  secure  workplace  for  our  employees.  We  set  specific  safety  standards  to  identify  and
manage critical risks. We use global safety management systems and employee training to ensure consistent implementation of safety
protocols and accurate measurement and tracking of incidents. To provide a safe and secure working environment for our employees,
we prohibit workplace discrimination, and we do not tolerate abusive conduct or harassment. Our attention to the health and safety of
our workforce extends to the workers and communities in our supply chain. We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to
our strategy and to our commitment to ethical business conduct.

business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Business and Industry Risks

The  categories  in  which  we  participate  are  very  competitive,  and  if  we  are not  able  to  compete  effectively,  our  results  of
operations could be adversely affected.

The human and pet food  categories  in which we  participate  are very  competitive. Our principal  competitors  in  these  categories are
manufacturers,  as  well  as  retailers  with  their  own  branded  and  private  label  products.  Competitors  market  and  sell  their  products
through  brick-and-mortar  stores  and  e-commerce.  All  of  our  principal  competitors  have  substantial  financial,  marketing,  and  other
resources.  In  most  product  categories,  we  compete  not  only  with  other  widely  advertised  branded  products,  but  also  with  regional
brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is
based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity,
convenient  ordering  and  delivery  to  the  consumer,  and  the  ability  to  identify  and  satisfy  consumer  preferences.  If  our  large
competitors  were  to  seek  an  advantage  through  pricing  or  promotional  changes,  we  could  choose  to  do  the  same,  which  could
adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected.
Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in
response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain
brand  equity  by  offering  recognizably  superior  product  quality,  we  may  be  unable  to  maintain  premium  pricing  over  generic  and
private label products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.

There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition,
large  retail  customers  may  seek  to  use  their  position  to  improve  their  profitability  through  improved  efficiency,  lower  pricing,
increased  reliance  on  their  own  brand  name  products,  increased  emphasis  on  generic  and  other  economy  brands,  and  increased
promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs,
and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In
addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percent
of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant
customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Price  changes  for  the  commodities  we  depend  on  for  raw  materials,  packaging, and  energy  may  adversely  affect  our
profitability.

The  principal  raw  materials  that  we  use  are  commodities  that  experience  price  volatility  caused  by  external  conditions  such  as
weather,  climate  change,  product  scarcity,  limited  sources  of  supply,  commodity  market  fluctuations,  currency  fluctuations,  trade
tariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental
agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodity
price  changes  may  result  in  unexpected  increases  in  raw  material,  packaging,  energy,  and  transportation  costs.  If  we  are  unable  to
increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We
do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as
we intend.

Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to avoid certain products or ingredients.

We  could  be  adversely  affected  if  consumers  in  our  principal  markets  lose  confidence  in  the  safety  and  quality  of  certain  of  our
products  or  ingredients.  Adverse  publicity  about  these  types  of  concerns,  whether  or  not  valid,  may  discourage  consumers  from
buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our
products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer
products  that  appeal  to  their  preferences  in  channels  where  they  shop.  Consumer  preferences  and  category-level  consumption  may
change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or
react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a
timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer.
Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium,
trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or
attributes.

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.

The  food  industry’s  growth  potential  is  constrained  by  population  growth.  Our  success  depends  in  part  on  our  ability  to  grow  our
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio
by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability
to  increase  market  share  in  our  existing  product  categories.  If  we  do  not  succeed  in  developing  innovative  products  for  new  and
existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.

Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our
brands  is  based  in  large  part  on  the  degree  to  which  consumers  react  and  respond  positively  to  these  brands.  Brand  value  could
diminish  significantly  due  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  consumer  perception  that  we  have  acted  in  an  irresponsible  manner,
adverse  publicity  about  our  products,  our  failure  to  maintain  the  quality  of  our  products,  the  failure  of  our  products  to  deliver
consistently  positive  consumer  experiences,  concerns  about  food  safety,  or  our  products  becoming  unavailable  to  consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of
social  and  digital  media  by  consumers,  us,  and  third  parties  increases  the  speed  and  extent  that  information  or  misinformation  and
opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously
damage  our  brands  and  reputation.  If  we  do  not  maintain  the  favorable  perception  of  our  brands,  our  business  results  could  be
negatively impacted.

Operating Risks

If  we  are  not  efficient  in  our  production,  our  profitability  could  suffer  as  a result  of  the  highly  competitive  environment  in
which we operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products
in  highly  competitive  markets.  Gaining  additional  efficiencies  may  become  more  difficult  over  time.  Our  failure  to  reduce  costs
through  productivity  gains  or  by  eliminating  redundant  costs  resulting  from  acquisitions  or  divestitures  could  adversely  affect  our
profitability  and  weaken  our  competitive  position.  Many  productivity  initiatives  involve  complex  reorganization  of  manufacturing
facilities  and production  lines.  Such  manufacturing realignment may  result  in  the  interruption of production, which may negatively
impact  product  volume  and  margins.  We  periodically  engage  in  restructuring  and  cost  savings  initiatives  designed  to  increase  our
efficiency  and  reduce  expenses.  If  we  are  unable  to  execute  those  initiatives  as  planned,  we  may  not  realize  all  or  any  of  the
anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our  ability  to  make,  move,  and  sell  products  is  critical  to  our  success.  Damage  or  disruption  to  raw  material  supplies  or  our
manufacturing  or  distribution  capabilities  due  to  weather,  climate  change,  natural  disaster,  fire,  terrorism,  cyber-attack,  pandemics,
war,  governmental  restrictions  or  mandates,  labor  shortages,  strikes,  import/export  restrictions,  or  other  factors  could  impair  our
ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single
supplier.  The failure of  third parties on which we rely,  including  those  third parties who  supply  our ingredients, packaging,  capital
equipment  and  other  necessary  operating  materials,  contract  manufacturers,  commercial  transport,  distributors,  contractors,  and

9

external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our
operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with
significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our
customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate
steps  to  mitigate  the  likelihood  or  potential  impact  of  such  events,  or  to  effectively  manage  such  events  if  they  occur,  particularly
when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as
require additional resources to restore our supply chain.

Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain
our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.

In fiscal 2023, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a
number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

political and economic instability;
exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;
nationalization or government control of operations;
compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
foreign tax treaties and policies; and
restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations
could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British
pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter
into  agreements  that  are  intended  to  reduce  the  effects  of  our  exposure  to  currency  fluctuations,  but  these  agreements  may  not  be
effective in significantly reducing our exposure.

A  strengthening  in  the  U.S.  dollar  relative  to  other  currencies  in  the  countries  in  which  we  operate  would  negatively  affect  our
reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses.

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.

Information  technology  serves  an  important  role  in  the  efficient  and  effective  operation  of  our  business.  We  rely  on  information
technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of
business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure
are  critical  to  effectively  manage  our  key  business  processes  including  digital  marketing,  order  entry  and  fulfillment,  supply  chain
management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication
among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about
our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent
on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as
catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer
viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security
and  viability  of  our  information  technology  systems,  as  well  as  the  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  the  data  stored  on
those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in
transaction  errors,  processing  inefficiencies,  data  loss,  legal  claims  or  proceedings,  regulatory  penalties,  and  the  loss  of  sales  and
customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts
that may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.

From  time  to  time,  we  evaluate  potential  acquisitions  or  joint  ventures  that  would  further  our  strategic  objectives.  Our  success
depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions,
our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of
key  employees  and  customers  of  the  acquired  business,  the  assumption  of  unknown  liabilities,  the  inherent  risk  associated  with
entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies,
and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

If  our  products  become  adulterated,  misbranded,  or  mislabeled,  we  might need  to  recall  those  items  and  may  experience
product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could
result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of
product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product
recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in
our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the
Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign
governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and
the  health  and  safety  of  our  employees.  Our  failure  to  comply  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  subject  us  to  lawsuits,
administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and
could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations.
We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience
to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase
our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.

We  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Our  failure  to  comply  with
environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to
a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of
unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and
compliance  costs  to  differ  from  our  estimates.  We  cannot  guarantee  that  our  costs  in  relation  to  these  matters,  or  compliance  with
environmental  laws  in  general,  will  not  exceed  our  established  liabilities  or  otherwise  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business  and
results of operations.

Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business.

There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on
global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  If such climate change
has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities
that are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities,
disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs.  Increasing concern
over  climate  change or other  sustainability  issues  also may  adversely  impact  demand  for our  products  due  to  changes  in  consumer
preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues.  We may also become subject to
additional  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  relating  to  climate  change  or  other  sustainability  issues,  including  greenhouse  gas
emission  regulations  (e.g.,  carbon  taxes),  energy  policies,  sustainability  initiatives  (e.g.,  single-use  plastic  limits),  and  disclosure
obligations.  If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that
we are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we chose
to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations.

We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress
toward  achieving  our  carbon  emissions  reduction  goals  and  commitments,  then  the  resulting  negative  publicity  could  harm  our
reputation and adversely affect demand for our products.

Financial and Economic Risks

Volatility  in  the  market  value  of  derivatives  we  use  to  manage  exposures  to  fluctuations  in  commodity  prices  may  cause
volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and
corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in
earnings currently, which may result in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we
utilize  the  underlying  input  in  our  manufacturing  process,  at  which  time  the  gains  and  losses  are  reclassified  to  segment  operating

11

profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting
treatments.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

The  willingness  of  consumers  to  purchase  our  products  depends  in  part  on  local  economic  conditions.  In  periods  of  economic
uncertainty,  consumers  may  purchase  more  generic,  private  label,  and  other  economy  brands  and  may  forego  certain  purchases
altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to
lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices
sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that
purchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

We  have  a  substantial  amount  of  indebtedness,  which  could  limit  financing  and  other  options  and  in  some  cases  adversely
affect our ability to pay dividends.

As  of  May  28,  2023,  we  had  total  debt  and  noncontrolling  interests  of  $12.0  billion.  The  agreements  under  which  we  have  issued
indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit
our:

•

•

ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if
the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and
flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general
economic conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply
with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its
stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial
performance,  which  in  turn  is  subject  to  prevailing  economic  conditions  and  to  financial,  business,  and  other  factors  beyond  our
control.

We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, our
credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overall global capital
markets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension,
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including
defined  benefit  pension,  retiree  health  and  welfare,  severance,  and  other  postemployment  plans.  Our  major  defined  benefit  pension
plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest
rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the
funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the
plans.  A  significant  increase  in  our  obligations  or  future  funding  requirements  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of
operations and cash flows from operations.

A  change  in  the  assumptions  regarding  the  future  performance  of  our  businesses  or  a  different  weighted-average  cost  of
capital  used  to  value  our  reporting  units  or  our  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  could  negatively  affect  our  consolidated
results of operations and net worth.

As of May 28, 2023, we had $21.2 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units
is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We
compare  the  carrying  value of  the reporting  unit,  including goodwill,  to  the  fair  value  of  the reporting unit.  If  the  fair  value  of  the
reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair
value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our
long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other
factors.  If  current  expectations  for  growth  rates  for  sales  and  profits  are  not  met,  or  other  market  factors  and  macroeconomic
conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwill
is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.

12

the  useful

lives  of  our

We  evaluate
the Blue  Buffalo,
Pillsbury, Totino’s, Old El Paso, Progresso, Annie’s, Nudges, and Häagen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-
lived.  Reaching  a  determination  on  useful  life  requires  significant  judgments  and  assumptions  regarding  the  future  effects  of
obsolescence,  demand,  competition,  other  economic  factors  (such  as  the  stability  of  the  industry,  known  technological  advances,
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the
level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

intangible  assets  associated  with

intangible  assets,  primarily

Our  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  also  tested  for  impairment  annually  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances
indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model
using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own
the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and
macroeconomic  conditions  were  to  change,  then  our  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  could  become  significantly  impaired.
Our Progresso, EPIC, and Uncle Toby’s brands had risk of decreasing coverage and we continue to monitor these businesses.

For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this report.

ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand
names.  We  work  continuously  to  improve  our  core  products  and  to  create  new  products  that  meet  consumers’  evolving  needs  and
preferences.  In  addition,  we  build  the  equity  of  our  brands  over  time  with  strong  consumer-directed  marketing,  innovative  new
products,  and  effective  merchandising.  We  believe  our  brand-building  approach  is  the  key  to  winning  and  sustaining  leading  share
positions in markets around the globe.

Our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe
achieving  that  goal  requires  us  to  generate  a  consistent  balance  of  net  sales  growth,  margin  expansion,  cash  conversion,  and  cash
return to shareholders over time.

Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:

2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;

•
•  mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;
•  mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);
•
free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and
•
cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.

We are executing our Accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term.
The  strategy  focuses  on  four  pillars  to  create  competitive  advantages  and  win:  boldly  building  brands,  relentlessly  innovating,
unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. We are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that
have  the  best  prospects  for  profitable  growth,  and  we  are  committed  to  reshaping  our  portfolio  with  strategic  acquisitions  and
divestitures to further enhance our growth profile.

In  fiscal  2023,  we  continued  to  successfully  adapt  to  the  dynamic  operating  environment  and  deliver  strong  performance.  This
included  growth  in  organic  net  sales,  adjusted  operating  profit,  and  adjusted  diluted  EPS  that  was  ahead  of  our  initial  targets.  We
achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year:

We  continued  to  compete  effectively,  including  holding  or  growing  market  share  in  more  than  50  percent  of  our  global
priority businesses for the fifth consecutive year, when adjusting for an unusual competitive dynamic in cereal in fiscal 2022
and  assessing  that  platform  on  a  2-year  basis.  We  generated  organic  net  sales  growth  across  each  of  our  four  operating
segments, fueled by compelling brand building and innovation across our leading brands, and supported with strong levels of
net price realization in response to 13 percent input cost inflation.

We  continued  to  invest  for  the  future,  including  a  17  percent  increase  in  media  and  advertising  expense,  a  double-digit
increase  in  investment  in  our  digital  and  technology  capability,  and  a  strong  increase  in  capital  investment  related  to  new
growth capacity.

We continued to reshape our portfolio, including closing on one acquisition and two divestitures that further improved our
portfolio’s ability to generate profitable growth over the long term.

Our  consolidated  net  sales  for  fiscal  2023  rose  6  percent  to  $20,094 million.  On  an  organic  basis,  net  sales  increased  10  percent
compared  to  year-ago  levels.  Operating  profit  of  $3,434 million  was  down  1  percent.  Adjusted  operating  profit  of  $3,457 million
increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis.  Diluted EPS of $4.31 was down 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022 results. Adjusted
diluted  EPS  of  $4.30  increased  10  percent  on  a  constant-currency  basis  (See  the  “Non-GAAP  Measures”  section  below  for  a
description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).

Net cash provided by operations totaled $2,779 million in fiscal 2023, representing a conversion rate of 106 percent of net earnings,
including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling
$690 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2,089 million at a conversion rate of 80 percent of adjusted net earnings, including
earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1,288
million and net share repurchases totaling $1,171 million. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use
of measures not defined by GAAP).

A  detailed  review  of  our  fiscal  2023  performance  compared  to  fiscal  2022  appears  below  in  the  section  titled  “Fiscal  2023
Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set
forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2022 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and
15

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2022 Results of Consolidated Operations,” which is incorporated
herein by reference.

In fiscal 2024, we expect to build on our positive momentum and continue to advance our Accelerate strategy.  Our key priorities are
to  continue  to  compete  effectively,  to  improve  our  supply  chain  efficiency,  and  to  maintain  our  disciplined  approach  to  capital
allocation.  We  expect  the  largest  factors  impacting  our  performance  in  fiscal  2024  will  be  the  economic  health  of  consumers,  the
moderating rate of input cost inflation, and the increasing stability of the supply chain environment. We expect to drive organic net
sales  growth  in  fiscal  2024  through  strong  marketing,  innovation,  in-store  support,  and  net  price  realization  generated  through  our
Strategic Revenue Management (SRM) capability, most of which will be carried over from SRM actions taken in fiscal 2023. For the
full year, input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 5 percent of total cost of goods sold, driven primarily by labor inflation
that  continues  to  impact  sourcing,  manufacturing,  and  logistics  costs.  We  expect  to  generate  higher  levels  of  Holistic  Margin
Management (HMM) cost savings compared to fiscal 2023.

Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2024 targets are summarized below:

•  Organic net sales are expected to increase 3 to 4 percent.
•  Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 4 to 6 percent in constant-currency from the base of $3,457 million reported

in fiscal 2023.

•  Adjusted diluted  EPS  are  expected  to  range  between 4  to  6 percent  in constant-currency  from  the  base  of  $4.30  earned  in

fiscal 2023.

•  Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings.

See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.

FISCAL 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In fiscal 2023, net sales increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2022 and organic net sales increased 10 percent compared to last year.
Operating profit decreased 1 percent to $3,434 million primarily driven by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume
growth,  an  unfavorable  change  to  the  mark-to-market  valuation  of  certain  commodities  positions  and  grain  inventories,  and  an
increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including increased media and advertising expenses, partially offset
by  favorable  net  price  realization  and  mix.  Operating  profit  margin  of  17.1  percent  decreased  120  basis  points.  Adjusted  operating
profit of $3,457 million increased 8 percent on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix,
partially offset by higher input costs, a decrease in contributions from volume growth and an increase in SG&A expenses, including
increased media and advertising expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2 percent. Diluted earnings
per share of $4.31 decreased 2 percent compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.30 increased 10 percent on a
constant-currency  basis  (see  the  “Non-GAAP  Measures”  section  below  for  a  description  of  our  use  of  measures  not  defined  by
GAAP).

Organic net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 10 percent compared to fiscal 2022, driven by favorable organic net price realization and
mix, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from organic volume growth.

Cost of sales increased $958 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,548 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $1,454 million increase
attributable to product rate and mix, partially offset by a $950 million decrease due to lower volume. We recorded a $292 million net
increase  in  cost  of  sales  related  to  mark-to-market  valuation  of  certain  commodity  positions  and  grain  inventories  in  fiscal  2023,
compared to a net decrease of $133 million in fiscal 2022 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
report  for  additional  information).  In  fiscal  2023,  we  recorded  a  $25  million  charge  related  to  a  voluntary  recall  on  certain
international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. We also recorded $5 million of restructuring charges and $2 million of restructuring
initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2023 compared to $3 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales in fiscal
2022 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

Gross margin increased 2 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 110 basis
points to 32.6 percent compared to fiscal 2022.

SG&A expenses increased $353 million to $3,500 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased media
and  advertising  expenses,  unfavorable  valuation  adjustments  and  the  loss  on  sale  of  certain  corporate  investments,  an  increase  in
certain compensation and benefits expenses, and an increase in charitable contributions in fiscal 2023. SG&A expenses as a percent of
net sales in fiscal 2023 increased 80 basis points compared to fiscal 2022.

Divestitures gain, net totaled $445 million in fiscal 2023 primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad
side dishes business. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $194 million divestitures gain related to the sale of our interest in Yoplait SAS,
Yoplait  marques  SNC  and  Liberté  Marques  Sàrl  and  our  European  dough  businesses  (please  refer  to  Note  3  to  the  Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).

Restructuring,  impairment,  and  other  exit  costs  (recoveries)  totaled  $56  million  in  fiscal  2023  compared  to  $26  million  of  net
recoveries  in  fiscal  2022.  In  fiscal  2023,  we  approved  restructuring  actions  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  our  global  supply  chain
structure and to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network, and as a result, we recorded $41 million of charges in fiscal 2023. In fiscal
2022, we approved restructuring actions in the International segment to drive efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics operations
and recorded $12 million of charges. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional
information.

17

Benefit plan non-service income totaled $89 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $113 million in fiscal 2022, primarily reflecting an
increase in interest costs, partially offset by lower amortization of losses and higher expected return on plan assets (please see Note 14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).

Interest, net for fiscal 2023 totaled $382 million, $2 million higher than fiscal 2022.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 19.5 percent compared to 18.3 percent in fiscal 2022. The 1.2 percentage point increase was
primarily  driven by  a  change  in  the valuation  allowance on our  capital loss  carryforwards  in fiscal 2022,  partially  offset by  certain
favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 20.9 percent in
fiscal 2022 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 0.5
percentage point decrease was primarily due to certain favorable discrete tax items in fiscal 2023.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased to $81 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $112 million in fiscal 2022, primarily
driven by higher input costs at CPW and HDJ and lower net sales at HDJ, partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix at
CPW.  On  a  constant-currency  basis,  after-tax  earnings  from  joint  ventures  decreased  18  percent  (see  the  “Non-GAAP  Measures”
section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth

Net  earnings  attributable  to  redeemable  and  noncontrolling  interests  decreased  to  $16  million  in  fiscal  2023  compared  to  $28

fiscal 2022.

Average  diluted  shares  outstanding  decreased  by  11 million  in  fiscal  2023  from  fiscal  2022  primarily  due  to  share  repurchases,

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

Our businesses are organized into four operating segments: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice.

In fiscal 2022, we completed a new organization structure to streamline our global operations. We restated our net sales by segment
and  segment  operating  profit  to  reflect  our  new  operating  segments.  These  segment  changes  had  no  effect  on  previously  reported
consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share.

report.

The 13 percent increase in North America Foodservice organic net sales growth in fiscal 2023 was driven by favorable organic net
price realization and mix, including market index pricing on bakery flour, partially offset by a decrease in contributions from organic
volume growth.

Segment  operating  profit  increased  14  percent  to  $290 million  in  fiscal  2023,  compared  to  $256 million  in  fiscal  2022,  primarily
driven by favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and an increase in SG&A expenses. Segment
operating  profit  increased  14  percent  on  a  constant-currency  basis  in  fiscal  2023  compared  to  fiscal  2022  (see  the  “Non-GAAP
Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS

Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives,
certain  charitable  contributions,  restructuring  initiative  project-related  costs,  gains  and  losses  on  corporate  investments,  and  other
items  that  are  not  part  of  our  measurement  of  segment  operating  performance.  These  include  gains  and  losses  arising  from  the
revaluation  of  certain  grain  inventories  and  gains  and  losses  from  mark-to-market  valuation  of  certain  commodity  positions  until
passed  back  to  our  operating  segments.  These  items  affecting  operating  profit  are  centrally  managed  at  the  corporate  level  and  are
excluded  from  the  measure  of  segment  profitability  reviewed  by  executive  management.  Under  our  supply  chain  organization,  our
manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency
and  productivity.  As  a  result,  fixed  assets  and  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  are  neither  maintained  nor  available  by
operating segment.

Unallocated corporate expense totaled $1,033 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $403 million last year. We recorded a $292 million
net increase in expense related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2023,
compared to a $133 million net decrease in expense last year. We recorded $84 million of net losses related to valuation adjustments
and the sale of corporate investments in fiscal 2023, compared to $15 million of net losses in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we recorded a
$22 million net charge related to a voluntary recall on certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products. In addition, we recorded
$6 million of integration costs primarily related to our acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023, compared to $22 million of integration
costs  related  to  our  acquisition  of  Tyson  Foods’  pet  treats  business  in  fiscal  2022.  In  fiscal  2022,  we  recorded  $73  million  of
transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale
of  our  European  dough  businesses.  In  addition,  we  recorded  a  $22  million  recovery  related  to  a  Brazil  indirect  tax  item  and  a  $13
million  insurance  recovery  in  fiscal  2022.  In  addition,  certain  compensation  and  benefits  expenses  and  charitable  contributions
increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We  experienced  broad  based  global  input  cost  inflation  of  13  percent  in  fiscal  2023  and  8  percent  in  fiscal  2022.  We  expect
approximately  5  percent  input  cost  inflation  in  fiscal  2024.  We  attempt  to  minimize  the  effects  of  inflation  through  HMM,  SRM,
planning, and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent two-year period, our operations have generated
$6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.  We  also  use  cash  from  operations  to  fund  our  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions,  and  debt  service.  We  typically  use  a

23

combination  of  cash,  notes  payable,  and  long-term  debt,  and  occasionally  issue  shares  of  common  stock,  to  finance  significant
acquisitions.

As of May 28, 2023, we had $381 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. In anticipation of repatriating
funds  from  foreign  jurisdictions,  we  record  local  country  withholding  taxes  on  our  international  earnings,  as  applicable.  We  may
repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax
liability. Earnings prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

During  fiscal  2023,  cash  provided  by  operations  was  $2,779  million  compared  to  $3,316 million  in  the  same  period  last  year.  The
$538 million decrease was primarily driven by a $326 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $250 million change in net
divestitures  gain.  The  $326  million  change  in  current  assets  and  liabilities  was  primarily  driven  by  a  $233  million  change  in
inventories  and  a  $257  million  change  in  accounts  payable,  partially  offset  by  a  $125  million  change  in  the  timing  of  accounts
receivable.

We  strive  to  grow  core  working  capital  at  or  below  the  rate  of  growth  in  our  net  sales.  For  fiscal  2023,  core  working  capital  net
liability  decreased  20  percent,  compared  to  a  net  sales  increase  of  6  percent.  The  core  working  capital  net  liability  decreased  $84
million from a net liability of $423 million in fiscal 2022 to a net liability of $339 million in fiscal 2023. The $84 million net liability
decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2023.

In  fiscal  2023,  we  used  $346 million  of  cash  through  investing  activities  compared  to  $1,691 million  in  fiscal  2022.  We  invested
$690 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2023, an increase of $121 million from fiscal 2022.

During fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust for $252 million cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of
our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes businesses for cash proceeds of $607 million.

During fiscal 2022, we acquired Tyson Foods’ pet treats business for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2022,
we sold our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl for cash proceeds of $32 million, net of cash

24

divested, as part of the sale. We also completed the sale of our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022 for cash proceeds of $42
million.

We  expect  capital  expenditures  to  be  approximately  4  percent  of  reported  net  sales  in  fiscal  2024.  These  expenditures  will  fund
initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States
and Europe.

We have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations
will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.

25

Certain  of our  long-term debt  agreements, our  credit facilities,  and  our noncontrolling  interests  contain  restrictive covenants. As of
May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

We have $1,709 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 3.65
percent fixed-rate notes due February 15, 2024, $400 million of floating-rate notes due October 17, 2023, €500 million of floating-rate
notes due July 27, 2023, and €250 million of floating-rate notes due November 10, 2023. We believe that cash flows from operations,
together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the
next 12 months.

As of May 28, 2023, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 80 percent in fixed-rate
and 20 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments on May
29, 2022.

The  third-party  holder  of  the  General  Mills  Cereals,  LLC  (GMC)  Class  A  Interests  receives  quarterly  preferred  distributions  from
available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in
the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests is
the sum of three-month Term SOFR plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated
agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.

We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid
preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital
account  from  its  original  value  will  be  charged  directly  to  retained  earnings  and  will  increase  or  decrease  the  net  earnings  used  to
calculate EPS in that period.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of this report. Our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and
results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets,
stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

Revenue Recognition
Our  revenues  are  reported  net  of  variable  consideration  and  consideration  payable  to  our  customers,  including  trade  promotion,
consumer  coupon  redemption,  and  other  reductions  to  the  transaction  price,  including  estimated  allowances  for  returns,  unsalable
product,  and  prompt  pay  discounts.  Trade  promotions  are  recorded  using  significant  judgment  of  estimated  participation  and
performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction
price  are  recognized  as  a  change  in  estimate  in  a  subsequent  period.  Our  accrued  trade  and  coupon  promotion  liabilities  were
$394 million as of May 28, 2023, and $420 million as of May 29, 2022. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are
inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable.
Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Intangible Assets
Goodwill  and  other  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  not  subject  to  amortization  and  are  tested  for  impairment  annually  and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill
impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to
determine  growth  rates  for  sales  and  profits.  We  also  make  estimates  of  discount  rates,  perpetuity  growth  assumptions,  market
comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination  on  useful  life  requires  significant  judgments  and  assumptions  regarding  the  future  effects  of  obsolescence,  demand,
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results
in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures,  and  the  expected  lives  of  other  related  groups  of  assets.  Intangible  assets  that  are  deemed  to  have  finite  lives  are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our
brand  assets  is  based  on  a  discounted  cash  flow  model  using  inputs  which  include  projected  revenues  from  our  long-range  plan,
assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

26

As of May 28, 2023, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair
value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value, and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially
different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in
material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2023 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first
day  of  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2023,  and  we  determined  there  was  no  impairment  of  our  intangible  assets  as  their  related  fair
values  were  substantially  in  excess  of  the  carrying  value,  except  for  Uncle  Toby’s  band  intangible  asset.  In  addition,  while  having
significant  coverage  as  of  our  fiscal  2023  assessment  date,  the  Progresso  and  EPIC  brand  intangible  assets  had  risk  of  decreasing
coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

Stock-based Compensation
The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to
have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility,
employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

The  estimated  fair  values  of  stock  options  granted  and  the  assumptions  used  for  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  were  as
follows:

Estimated fair values of stock options granted
Assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would decrease the grant
date fair value by less than 1 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2023
volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2023 option awards by 5 percent.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to
final  intrinsic  values.  Historical  data  has  a  significant  bearing  on  our  forward-looking  assumptions.  Significant  variances  between
actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-
over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual
impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and
the  relationship  between  the  exercise-date  market  value  of  the  underlying  stock  and  the  original  grant-date  fair  value  previously
determined for financial reporting purposes.

Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that
significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Income Taxes
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. For
more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain
circumstances,  we  also  provide  accruable  benefits,  primarily  severance,  to  former  and  inactive  employees  in  the  United  States,
Canada,  and  Mexico.  Please  see  Note  14  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Item  8  of  this  report  for  a  description  of  our
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

27

We  recognize  benefits  provided  during  retirement  or  following  employment  over  the  plan  participants’  active  working  lives.
Accordingly,  we  make  various  assumptions  to  predict  and  measure  costs  and  obligations  many  years  prior  to  the  settlement  of  our
obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net
periodic  benefit  expense  or  income  and  accumulated  benefit  obligations  include  the  long-term  rates  of  return  on  plan  assets,  the
interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

Our  historical  investment  returns  (compound  annual  growth  rates)  for  our  United  States  defined  benefit  pension  and  other
postretirement  benefit  plan  assets  were  a  5.7  percent  loss  in  the  1-year  period  ended  May  28,  2023  and  returns  of  3.4  percent,  5.9
percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.7 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended May 28, 2023.

On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 6.70 percent for fiscal 2023, 5.85 percent for
fiscal 2022, and 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2024, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets
for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.20 percent due to higher prospective
long-term asset returns primarily on fixed income investments.

Lowering  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  assets  by  100  basis  points  would  increase  our  net  pension  and  postretirement
expense by $62 million for fiscal 2024. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-
related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment
gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and
the  actual  return  based  on  the  market-related  value  of  assets.  Our  outside  actuaries  perform  these  calculations  as  part  of  our
determination of annual expense or income.

Discount Rates

We  estimate  the  service  and  interest  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  expense  for  our  United  States  and  most  of  our
international  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and  postemployment  benefit  plans  utilizing  a  full  yield  curve
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit,  and  postemployment  benefit  plan  obligations.  We  work  with  our  outside  actuaries  to  determine  the  timing  and  amount  of
expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest
rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future
cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:

Effective rate for fiscal 2024 service costs
Effective rate for fiscal 2024 interest costs
Obligations as of May 31, 2023
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 service costs
Effective rate for fiscal 2023 interest costs

Lowering  the  discount  rates  by  100  basis  points  would  increase  our  net  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $30 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses
are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average
remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to
remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption
is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.6 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down
annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2032 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations
only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to
approximate  the  current  economic  view  on  the  rate  of  long-term  inflation  plus  an  appropriate  health  care  cost  premium.  Assumed
trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once
recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active
plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all”
inactive participants.

Financial Statement Impact

In  fiscal  2023,  we  recorded  net  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and  postemployment  benefit  plan  income  of
$6 million compared to $26 million of income in fiscal 2022 and $4 million of expense in fiscal 2021. As of May 28, 2023, we had
cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial
net  gains  of  $189 million  on  our  postretirement  and  postemployment  benefit  plans,  mainly  as  the  result  of  liability  increases  from
lower historical interest rates. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement
benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.

Actual  future  net  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and  postemployment  benefit  plan  income  or  expense  will
depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related
to the populations participating in these plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In  December  2022,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued  optional  accounting  guidance  for  a  limited  period  of
time  to  ease  the  potential  burden  in  accounting  for  reference  rate  reform.  The  new  standard  provides  expedients  and  exceptions  to
existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference
rates,  such  as  LIBOR,  to  alternative  reference  rates,  if  certain  criteria  are  met.  The  new  accounting  requirements  can  be  applied
through  December 31,  2024.  We  have  reviewed  and  modified  certain  contracts,  where  necessary,  to  apply  a  new  reference  rate,
primarily the SOFR. The guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
position. We will continue to review our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate during the
transition period.

In September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04 requiring enhanced disclosures related to supplier
financing programs. The ASU requires disclosure of the key terms of the program and a rollforward of the related obligation during
the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid. The new disclosure requirements
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with the exception of the rollforward requirement, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for the primary requirement and the
first quarter of fiscal 2025 for the rollforward requirement. Early adoption is permitted. We have historically presented the key terms
of these programs and the associated obligation outstanding. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial
statements and related disclosures.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

We have  included  in  this  report measures of  financial performance  that are  not defined by  GAAP. We believe  that  these  measures
provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.

For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP
measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful
information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP
measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.

Significant Items Impacting Comparability

Several  measures  below  are  presented  on  an  adjusted  basis.  The  adjustments  are  either  items  resulting  from  infrequently  occurring
events or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results.

The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability of our results.

Divestitures gain, net
Net divestitures gain primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business in fiscal 2023.
Divestitures gain related to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl and the sale of
our European dough businesses in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Mark-to-market effects
Net  mark-to-market  valuation  of  certain  commodity  positions  recognized  in  unallocated  corporate  items.  Please  see  Note  8  to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

of certain corporate investments in fiscal 2022.

Restructuring charges (recoveries) and project-related costs
Restructuring  charges  and  project-related  costs  for  global  supply  chain  actions,  network  optimization  actions,  and  previously
announced  restructuring  actions  in  fiscal  2023.  Restructuring  charges  for  International  restructuring  actions  and  net  restructuring
recoveries for previously announced restructuring actions in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this report.

Product recall, net
Voluntary recall costs recorded in fiscal 2023 related to certain international Häagen-Dazs ice cream products, net of insurance
recovery.

Acquisition integration costs
Integration costs primarily resulting from the acquisition of TNT Crust in fiscal 2023. Integration costs resulting from the acquisition
of Tyson Foods’ pet treats business in fiscal 2022. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Transaction costs
Transaction costs primarily related to the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dish business in fiscal 2023. Fiscal
2022 transaction costs related primarily to the sale of our interests in Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl,
the  sale  of  our  European  dough  businesses,  the  sale  of  our  Helper  main  meals  and  Suddenly  Salad  side  dishes  business,  and  the
acquisition of TNT Crust. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Non-income tax recovery
Recovery related to a Brazil indirect tax item recorded in fiscal 2022.

carryforwards expected to be used against future divestiture gains.

CPW restructuring charges
CPW restructuring charges related to previously announced restructuring actions.

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates

We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to
our  Board  of  Directors  and  executive  management  and  as  a  component  of  the  measurement  of  our  performance  for  incentive
compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide
transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as
well  as  acquisitions,  divestitures,  and  a  53rd  week,  when  applicable,  have  on  year-to-year  comparability.  A  reconciliation  of  these
measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and
Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.

30

Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate

This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our
performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is
the  operating profit  measure  we  use  to  evaluate  operating  profit  performance on  a  comparable year-to-year basis. Additionally,  the
measure  is  evaluated on  a  constant-currency  basis  by  excluding  the  effect  that  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations  have on
year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:

Adjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate

This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management. We believe that this measure provides useful
information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year
basis.

The reconciliation of our GAAP measure, diluted EPS, to adjusted diluted EPS and the related constant-currency growth rate follows:

Free Cash Flow Conversion Rate

We  believe  this  measure  provides  useful  information  to  investors  because  it  is  important  for  assessing  our  efficiency  in  converting
earnings  to  cash  and  returning  cash  to  shareholders.  The  calculation  of  free  cash  flow  conversion  rate  and  net  cash  provided  by
operating activities conversion rate, its equivalent GAAP measure, follows:

Forward-Looking Financial Measures

Our fiscal 2024 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, and free cash
flow conversion are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability,
including  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  restructuring  charges  and  project-related  costs,  acquisition
transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark-to-market effects. We are not able to reconcile these forward-
looking  non-GAAP  financial  measures  to  their  most  directly  comparable  forward-looking  GAAP  financial  measures  without
unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign

36

currency  exchange  rates  and  commodity  prices  or  the  timing  or  impact  of  acquisitions,  divestitures,  and  restructuring  actions
throughout fiscal 2024. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2024 GAAP financial results.

For fiscal 2024, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge
positions) and acquisitions and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2024 to reduce net sales growth by approximately one half of one
percent; and restructuring charges to total approximately $15 million to $20 million.

ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We  are  exposed  to  market  risk  stemming  from  changes  in  interest  and  foreign  exchange  rates  and  commodity  and  equity  prices.
Changes  in  these  factors  could  cause  fluctuations  in  our  earnings  and  cash  flows.  In  the  normal  course  of  business,  we  actively
manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that
place controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit
limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For
information  on  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  commodity  price,  and  equity  instrument  risk,  please  see  Note  8  to  the  Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

VALUE AT RISK

The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse
changes  in  market  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,  and  equity  prices  under  normal  market  conditions.  A
Monte Carlo value-at-risk (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal
market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.

The  VAR  calculation  used  historical  interest  and  foreign  exchange  rates,  and  commodity  and  equity  prices  from  the  past  year  to
estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data
set.  The  calculations  are  not  intended  to  represent  actual  losses  in  fair  value  that  we  expect  to  incur.  Further,  since  the  hedging
instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of
our  derivatives  would  be  generally  offset  by  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  exposure.  The  positions
included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and
options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related
positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign
currency, commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 28, 2023.

May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable
interest,  and  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  years  in  the  three-year  period  ended  May 28, 2023,  and  the  related  notes  and  financial
statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of May 28, 2023, and May 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year  period  ended  May 28, 2023,  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Also  in  our  opinion,  the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria
established  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial  reporting,  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such
procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the
maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a
whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or
on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of goodwill and brand intangible assets

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill and brands and other indefinite-lived intangibles
balances  as  of  May  28,  2023,  were  $14,511.2  million  and  $6,712.4  million,  respectively.  The  impairment  tests  for  these
assets, which are performed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have
occurred, require the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned as well as the
brands and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow analyses
that  require  the  Company  to  make  judgments  about  highly  subjective matters,  including  future  operating  results, including
revenue growth rates and operating margins, and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates.

We identified the assessment of the valuation of certain goodwill and brand intangible assets as a critical audit matter. There
was  a  significant  degree  of  judgment  required  in  evaluating  audit  evidence,  which  consists  primarily  of  forward-looking
assumptions  about  future  operating  results,  specifically  the  revenue  growth  rates  and  operating  margins,  royalty  rates  and
subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates.

The following  are  the primary  procedures we performed to  address  this  critical  audit matter. We  evaluated  the design  and
tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the valuation of goodwill and brand intangible assets. This
included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure
the fair value of the reporting units and brands intangible assets. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth
rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential
assumptions.  We  evaluated  the  revenue  growth  rates  and  operating  margin  assumptions  by  comparing  them  to  recent
financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with
evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted
in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed
using publicly available market data for comparable entities and the royalty rates by evaluating the methods, assumptions and
market data used to estimate the royalty rates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling
financial  interest.  Intercompany  transactions  and  accounts,  including  any  noncontrolling  and  redeemable  interests’  share  of  those
transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Our India business is on an April fiscal year end.

Certain  reclassifications  to  our  previously  reported  financial  information  have  been  made  to  conform  to  the  current  period
presentation.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
All  inventories  in  the  United  States  other  than  grain  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost,  using  the  last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  method,  or
market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with
all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.

Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net
realizable value.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales and are recognized
when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded
at  cost  and  depreciated  over  estimated  useful  lives,  primarily  using  the  straight-line  method.  Ordinary  maintenance  and  repairs  are
charged  to  cost  of  sales.  Buildings  are  usually  depreciated  over  40  years,  and  equipment,  furniture,  and  software  are  usually
depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or
retired,  the  accounts  are  relieved  of  its  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  and  the  resulting  gains  and  losses,  if  any,  are
recognized in earnings.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset  (or  asset  group)  may  not  be  recoverable.  An  impairment  loss  would  be  recognized  when  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash
flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have
identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the
excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or
independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill  is  not  subject  to  amortization  and  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances
indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as
of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare
the  carrying  value  of  a  reporting  unit,  including  goodwill,  to  the  fair  value  of  the  unit.  Carrying  value  is  based  on  the  assets  and
liabilities  associated  with  the  operations  of  that  reporting  unit,  which  often  requires  allocation  of  shared  or  corporate  items  among
reporting  units.  If  the  carrying  amount  of  a  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  impairment  has  occurred.  We  recognize  an
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of
goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth
rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates,
perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination  on  useful  life  requires  significant  judgments  and  assumptions  regarding  the  future  effects  of  obsolescence,  demand,
competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results

in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance
expenditures,  and  the  expected  lives  of  other  related  groups  of  assets.  Intangible  assets  that  are  deemed  to  have  finite  lives  are
amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s, Old El
Paso, Progresso, Annie’s, Nudges, and Häagen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a
discounted  cash  flow  model  using  inputs  which  included  projected  revenues  from  our  long-range  plan,  assumed  royalty  rates  that
could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would
be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow
model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.

Leases
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When our lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components,
we account for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.

Any  lease  arrangements  with  an  initial  term  of  12  months  or  less  are  not  recorded  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  and  we
recognize lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our lease arrangements provide
us with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. We include these options when we are
reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish our right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, our lease
agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.

We  have  certain  lease  arrangements  with  variable  rental  payments.  Our  lease  arrangements  for  our  Häagen-Dazs  retail  shops  often
include rental payments that are based on a percentage of retail sales. We have other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically
based on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not
included  as  minimum  lease  payments  used  to  determine  our  right  of  use  assets  and  lease  liabilities.  Variable  rental  payments  are
recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

As  most  of  our  lease  arrangements  do  not  provide  an  implicit  interest  rate,  we  apply  an  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  the
information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our  investments  in  companies  over  which  we  have  the  ability  to  exercise  significant  influence  are  stated  at  cost  plus  our  share  of
undistributed  earnings  or  losses.  We  receive  royalty  income  from  certain  joint  ventures,  incur  various  expenses  (primarily  research
and  development),  and  record  the  tax  impact  of  certain  joint  venture  operations  that  are  structured  as  partnerships.  In  addition,  we
make  advances  to  our  joint  ventures  in  the  form  of  loans  or  capital  investments.  We  also  sell  certain  raw  materials,  semi-finished
goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.

In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including,
but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of
capital,  or  significant  business  disruptions.  The  significant  assumptions  used  to  estimate  fair  value  include  revenue  growth  and
profitability,  royalty  rates,  capital  spending,  depreciation  and  taxes,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  and  a  discount  rate.  By  their
nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than
the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the
investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.

Revenue Recognition
Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation
– the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation
has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by
our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and
consideration  payable  to  our  customers,  including  trade  promotion,  consumer  coupon  redemption  and  other  reductions  to  the
transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added,
and  other  excise  taxes  are  not  included  in  revenue.  Trade  promotions  are  recorded  using  significant  judgment  of  estimated
participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated and actual reductions to
the  transaction  price  are  recognized  as  a  change  in  estimate  in  a  subsequent  period.  We  generally  do  not  allow  a  right  of  return.

48

However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances,
product  returned  in  saleable  condition  is  resold  to  other  customers  or  outlets.  Receivables  from  customers  generally  do  not  bear
interest. Payment terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel, and are short-term, and as such, we do not have
any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to
our  trade  receivables.  We  pool  our  trade  receivables  based  on  similar  risk  characteristics,  such  as  geographic  location,  business
channel, and other account data. To estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts, we leverage information on historical losses, asset-
specific risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are
written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 17 for a disaggregation of our revenue
into  categories  that  depict  how  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  and  uncertainty  of  revenue  and  cash  flows  are  affected  by  economic
factors. We do not have material contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers.

Environmental Costs
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably
estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.

Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures
for  new  product  and  manufacturing  process  innovation,  and  the  annual  expenditures  are  comprised  primarily  of  internal  salaries,
wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities,
including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Foreign Currency Translation
For  all  significant  foreign  operations,  the  functional  currency  is  the  local  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  of  these  operations  are
translated  at  the  period-end  exchange  rates.  Income  statement  accounts  are  translated  using  the  average  exchange  rates  prevailing
during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity.
Gains  and  losses  from  foreign  currency  transactions  are  included  in  net  earnings  for  the  period,  except  for  gains  and  losses  on
investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on
instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.

Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their
fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of
derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective
as  a  hedge  transaction  and,  if  so,  the  type  of  hedge  transaction.  Gains  or  losses  on  derivative  instruments  reported  in  AOCI  are
reclassified  to  earnings  in  the  period  the  hedged  item  affects  earnings.  If  the  underlying  hedged  transaction  ceases  to  exist,  any
associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time.

Stock-based Compensation
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share
of  our  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  We  estimate  the  value  of  stock  option  grants  using  a  Black-Scholes  valuation  model.  Generally,
stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in
selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to
each reportable segment in our segment results.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of
eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s or director’s retention of the
award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized
immediately  for  awards  granted  to  retirement-eligible  individuals  or  over  the  period  from  the  grant  date  to  the  date  retirement
eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired
employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in
the  United  States,  Canada,  and  Mexico.  We  recognize  an  obligation  for  any  of  these  benefits  that  vest  or  accumulate  with  service.

49

Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in
the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.

Use of Estimates
Preparing  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These  estimates  include  our  accounting  for  revenue  recognition,  valuation  of  long-lived  assets,  intangible  assets,  stock-based
compensation,  income  taxes,  and  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit  and  postemployment  benefit  plans.  Actual
results could differ from our estimates.

New Accounting Standards
In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the measurement of credit losses on financial
instruments, including trade receivables. The new standard and subsequent amendments replace the incurred loss impairment model
with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Our allowance
for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of expected credit losses related to our trade receivables. We pool our trade receivables
based on similar risk characteristics, such as geographic location, business channel, and other account data. To estimate our allowance
for  doubtful  accounts,  we  leverage  information  on  historical  losses,  asset-specific  risk  characteristics,  current  conditions,  and
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the
amount  is  uncollectible.  We  adopted  the  requirements  of  the  new  standard  and  subsequent  amendments  using  the  modified
retrospective transition approach, and recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $5.7 million after-tax.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES

During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired TNT Crust, a manufacturer of high-quality frozen pizza crusts for regional and
national pizza chains, foodservice distributors, and retail outlets, for a purchase price of $253.0 million. We financed the transaction
with U.S. commercial paper. We consolidated the TNT Crust business into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of
$156.8 million. The goodwill is included in the North America Foodservice segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The pro
forma  effects  of  this  acquisition  were  not  material.  We  have  conducted  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  fair  value  of  the  acquired
assets  and  liabilities  of  the  TNT  Crust  business  and  will  continue  to  review  these  items  during  the  measurement  period.  If  new
information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised to
reflect the resulting adjustments to current estimates of these items. The consolidated results of the TNT Crust business are reported in
our North America Foodservice segment on a one-month lag.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our Helper main meals and Suddenly Salad side dishes business to
Eagle Family Foods Group for $606.8 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $442.2 million.

In fiscal 2022, we sold our European dough businesses and recorded a net pre-tax gain on sale of $30.4 million.

During  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  2022,  we  sold  our  interests  in  Yoplait  SAS,  Yoplait  Marques  SNC,  and  Liberté  Marques  Sàrl  to
Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in exchange for Sodiaal’s interest in our Canadian yogurt business, a modified agreement for the use of
Yoplait and Liberté brands in the United States and Canada, and cash. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of $163.7 million on the sale of
these businesses.

During  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2022,  we  acquired  Tyson  Foods’  pet  treats  business  for  $1.2  billion  in  cash.  We  financed  the
transaction  with  a  combination  of  cash  on  hand  and  short-term  debt.  We  consolidated  Tyson  Foods’  pet  treats  business  into  our
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  and  recorded  goodwill  of  $762.3 million,  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  for  the  Nudges, Top
Chews, and True  Chews brands  totaling  $330.0 million  in  aggregate,  and  a  finite-lived  customer  relationship  asset  of  $40.0 million.
The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not
material.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2021,  we  recorded  a  pre-tax  loss  of  $53.5  million  related  to  the  sale  of  our  Laticínios  Carolina
business in Brazil.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets and are evaluated against internal rate of
return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each
major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination
fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our
disclosures  regarding  restructuring  activity,  refers  to  the  increase  in  depreciation  expense  caused  by  shortening  the  useful  life  or
updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan.
Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.

Restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2023 were as follows:

In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions to enhance the efficiency of our global supply chain structure. We expect to incur
approximately  $52  million  of  restructuring  charges  and  project-related  costs  related  to  these  actions,  of  which  approximately  $35
million will be cash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $26 million of severance and $26 million of other costs,
primarily  $8  million  of  asset  impairment  and  $11  million  of  other  asset  write-offs.  We  recognized  $25.8  million  of  severance  and
$10.4 million of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025.

In fiscal 2023, we approved restructuring actions in our International segment to optimize our Häagen-Dazs shops network. We expect
to incur approximately $10 million of restructuring charges and project-related costs related to these actions, of which approximately
$9 million will be cash. These charges are expected to consist of approximately $6 million of severance and $4 million of other costs.
We recognized $5.6 million of severance and $0.8 million of other costs in fiscal 2023. We expect these actions to be completed by
the end of fiscal 2024.

Certain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required.

We paid net $36.6 million of cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2023. We paid net $93.9 million of cash in fiscal 2022.

Our  annual  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  impairment  test  was  performed  on  the  first  day  of  the  second  quarter  of
fiscal  2023,  and  we  determined  there  was  no  impairment  of  our  intangible  assets  as  their  related  fair  values  were  substantially  in
excess of the carrying values, except for the Uncle Toby’s brand intangible asset. In addition, while having significant coverage as of
our fiscal 2023 assessment date, the Progresso and EPIC brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to
monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

We did not identify any indicators of impairment for any goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 28, 2023.

NOTE 7. LEASES

Our lease portfolio primarily consists of operating lease arrangements for certain warehouse and distribution space, office space, retail
shops,  production  facilities,  rail  cars,  production  and  distribution  equipment,  automobiles,  and  office  equipment.  Our  lease  costs

There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Gains and losses are determined by
specific identification.

Classification  of  marketable  securities  as  current  or  noncurrent  is  dependent  upon  our  intended  holding  period  and  the  security’s
maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI
within stockholders’ equity.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates
and commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and
swaps) pursuant to our established policies.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives
to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean),
dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty
with  regard  to  the  future  price  of  commodities  purchased  for  use  in  our  supply  chain.  We  manage  our  exposures  through  a
combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options
and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as
close as possible to or below our planned cost.

We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve
hedge  accounting  for  commodity  derivative  positions.  Accordingly,  the  changes  in  the  values  of  these  derivatives  are  recorded
currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our
objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of
measuring  segment  operating  performance  these  gains  and  losses  are  reported  in  unallocated  corporate  items  outside  of  segment
operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from
unallocated  corporate  items  to  segment  operating  profit,  allowing  our  operating  segments  to  realize  the  economic  effects  of  the
derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 included:

In Millions
Net (loss) gain on mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions
Net gain on commodity positions reclassified from unallocated corporate
   items to segment operating profit
Net mark-to-market revaluation of certain grain inventories
Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions recognized in
   unallocated corporate items

agricultural inputs and $148.9 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the
next 12 months.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We  are  exposed  to  interest  rate  volatility  with  regard  to  future  issuances  of  fixed-rate  debt,  and  existing  and  future  issuances  of
floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, SOFR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and
Europe.  We  use  interest  rate  swaps,  forward-starting  interest  rate  swaps,  and  treasury  locks  to  hedge  our  exposure  to  interest  rate
changes,  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  our  financing  costs,  and  to  achieve  a  desired  proportion  of  fixed-rate  versus  floating-rate  debt,
based  on  current  and  projected  market  conditions.  Generally  under  these  swaps,  we  agree  with  a  counterparty  to  exchange  the
difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of
forecasted  issuances  of  debt.  Effectiveness  is  assessed  based  on  either  the  perfectly  effective  hypothetical  derivative  method  or
changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified
into earnings over the life of the associated debt.

Fixed  Interest  Rate  Exposures  —  Fixed-to-floating  interest  rate  swaps  are  accounted  for  as  fair  value  hedges  with  effectiveness
assessed  based  on  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  debt  and  derivatives,  using  incremental  borrowing  rates  currently
available on loans with similar terms and maturities.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into €750.0 million of forward-starting
swaps. The forward-starting swap agreements were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the
Company’s issuance of a €750.0 million 6-year fixed-rate note. Upon termination, a loss of $5.0 million was recognized in AOCI and
will be amortized through interest expense over the respective term of the debt.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in advance of planned debt financing, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks. The
treasury locks were terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in conjunction with the Company’s issuance of a $1,000.0
million 10-year fixed-rate note. Upon termination, a loss of $1.4 million was recognized in AOCI and will be amortized through
interest expense over the respective term of the debt.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a $500.0 million notional amount interest swap to convert our $500.0 million
fixed rate notes due November 18, 2025, to a floating rate.

As of May 28, 2023, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified
to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:

In Millions
3.65% notes due February 15, 2024

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party
purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign
currency  earnings  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  Our  principal  exposures  are  to  the  Australian  dollar,  Brazilian  real,  British  pound  sterling,
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward
contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial
paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with
foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in
earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.

As of May 28, 2023, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $933.0 million.

We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We hedged a portion of these net investments by
issuing  euro-denominated  commercial paper  and  foreign exchange forward  contracts. As of May 28,  2023, we hedged  a portion of
these net investments with €2,949.9 million of euro denominated bonds. As of May 28, 2023, we had deferred net foreign currency
transaction gains of $71.9 million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity.

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

Equity  price  movements  affect  our  compensation  expense  as  certain  investments  made  by  our  employees  in  our  deferred
compensation plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 28, 2023, the net notional amount of our equity
swaps was $177.5 million. In fiscal 2024, $165.4 million of swap contracts will mature, and $12.1 million of swap contracts mature in
fiscal 2025.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from
each  of  the  major  credit  rating  agencies.  If  our  debt  were  to  fall  below  investment  grade,  the  counterparties  to  the  derivative
instruments  could  request  full  collateralization  on  derivative  instruments  in  net  liability  positions.  The  aggregate  fair  value  of  all
derivative  instruments  with  credit-risk-related  contingent  features  that  were  in  a  liability  position  on  May  28,  2023,  was  $100.1
million. We have posted $60.5 million of collateral under these contracts.

We  enter  into  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  and  certain  commodity  and  equity  derivatives,  primarily  with  a  diversified  group  of
highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy,
limit  the  amount  of  credit  exposure  to  any  one  party.  These  transactions  may  expose  us  to  potential  losses  due  to  the  risk  of
nonperformance  by  these  counterparties;  however,  we  have  not  incurred  a  material  loss.  We  also  enter  into  commodity  futures
transactions through various regulated exchanges.

62

The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the
contracts, is $4.5 million. We have no collateral held against these contracts. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our
transactions  require  collateral  or  other  security  to  support  financial  instruments  subject  to  threshold  levels  of  exposure  and
counterparty  credit  risk.  Collateral  assets  are  either  cash  or  U.S.  Treasury  instruments  and  are  held  in  a  trust  account  that  we  may
access if the counterparty defaults.

We  offer  certain  suppliers  access  to  third-party  services  that  allow  them  to  view  our  scheduled  payments  online.  The  third-party
services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party.
We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties, or any
financial  institutions  concerning  this  service.  All  of  our  accounts  payable  remain  as  obligations  to  our  suppliers  as  stated  in  our
supplier agreements. As of May 28, 2023, $1,430.1 million of our accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-
party services. As of May 29, 2022, $1,429.6 million of our accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-party
services.

NOTE 10. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Our principal noncontrolling interest relates to our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary.

The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application
of  a  floating  preferred  return  rate  to  the  holder’s  capital  account  balance  established  in  the  most  recent  mark-to-market  valuation
(currently $251.5 million). The floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests is the sum of the three-month Term SOFR
plus 186 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest
holder or through a remarketing auction.

During  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  2022,  we  completed  the  sale  of  our  interests  in  Yoplait  SAS,  Yoplait  Marques  SNC  and  Liberté
Marques  Sàrl  to  Sodiaal  in  exchange  for  Sodiaal’s  interest  in  our  Canadian  yogurt  business,  a  modified  agreement  for  the  use  of
Yoplait and Liberté brands in the United States and Canada, and cash. Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Up to the date of the divestiture, Sodiaal held the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the
fair  value  of  Sodiaal’s 49  percent  euro-denominated  interest  in  Yoplait  SAS  as  a  redeemable  interest  on  our  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets. Sodiaal had the right to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value until the divestiture closed in the third
quarter of fiscal 2022. In connection with the divestiture, cumulative adjustments made to the redeemable interest related to the fair
value put feature were reversed against additional paid-in capital, where changes in the redemption amount were historically recorded,
and the resulting carrying value of the noncontrolling interests were included in the calculation of the gain on divestiture.

We paid dividends of $105.1 million in fiscal 2022 and $40.3 million in fiscal 2021 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS,
Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements.

A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS had an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal through November 28,
2021. Net purchases totaled $99.5 million for the six-month period ended November 28, 2021.

For  financial  reporting  purposes,  the  assets,  liabilities,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows  of  our  non-wholly  owned  consolidated
subsidiaries  are  included  in  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  third-party  investor’s  share  of  the  net  earnings  of  these
subsidiaries  is  reflected  in  net  earnings  attributable  to  redeemable  and  noncontrolling  interests  in  our  Consolidated  Statements  of
Earnings.

Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

NOTE 11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.

On June 27, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under
the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other
derivative  instruments,  Rule  10b5-1  trading  plans,  and  accelerated  repurchase  programs.  The  authorization  has  no  specified
termination date.

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 28,
2023, a total of 35.1 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
shares of unrestricted stock under the 2022 Stock Compensation Plan (2022 Plan). The 2022 Plan also provides for the issuance of
cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding
include  some  granted  under  the  2017  Stock  Compensation  Plan,  under  which  no  further  awards  may  be  granted.  The  stock  plans
provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.

Stock Options
The  estimated  fair  values  of  stock  options  granted  and  the  assumptions  used  for  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  were  as

We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make
predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We
estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of
volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did
not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than
6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.

Our  expected  term  represents  the  period  of  time  that  options  granted  are  expected  to  be  outstanding  based  on  historical  data  to
estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical
exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all
employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based
on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings
(referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized
windfall  tax  benefits  and  shortfall  tax  deficiencies  related  to  the  exercise  or  vesting  of  stock-based  awards  are  recognized  in  the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units
Stock  and  units  settled  in  stock  subject  to  a  restricted  period  and  a  purchase  price,  if  any  (as  determined  by  the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2022 Plan. As of May 28, 2023, there were no
stock-based awards granted under the 2022 Plan. Under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan, restricted stock and restricted stock units
generally vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our
future achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative operating cash flow and a relative total
shareholder  return  modifier.  Performance  share  units  are  settled  in  common  stock  and  are  generally  subject  to  a  three-year
performance  and  vesting  period.  The  sale  or  transfer  of  these  awards  is  restricted  during  the  vesting  period.  Participants  holding
restricted  stock,  but  not  restricted  stock  units  or  performance  share  units,  are  entitled  to  vote  on  matters  submitted  to  holders  of
common  stock  for  a  vote.  These  awards  accumulate  dividends  from  the  date  of  grant,  but  participants  only  receive  payment  if  the
awards vest.

NOTE 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.
We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. We do not expect to be required to make
any  contributions  to  our  principal  U.S.  plans  in  fiscal  2024.  Our  principal  U.S.  retirement  plan  covering  salaried  employees  has  a
provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change
in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined
benefit pension plan.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We  also  sponsor plans  that provide health care  benefits  to  many  of our  retirees  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  and Brazil.  The U.S.
salaried  health  care  benefit  plan  is  contributory,  with  retiree  contributions  based  on  years  of  service.  We  make  decisions  to  fund
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2023
or fiscal 2022. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 2024.

In fiscal 2021, we approved amendments to reorganize certain U.S. retiree health and welfare benefit plans. The General Mills Retiree
Health  Plan  for  Union  Employees  was  divided  into  two  plans,  with  participants  under  age  65  remaining  within  its  coverage,  and
participants age 65 and over covered by The General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+). Effective January 1, 2022,
the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees (65+) allows certain participants to purchase individual health insurance
policies on a private health care exchange. Additionally, the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills was merged into the General
Mills  Retiree  Health  Plan  for  Union  Employees.  Separate  benefit  structures  and  plan  provisions  continue  to  apply  to  eligible
participants of these merged plans. A portion of the General Mills Retiree Health Plan for Union Employees overfunded plan assets
were segregated to offset the cost of the Employees’ Benefit Plan of General Mills health and welfare benefits. The segregation of
assets  is  reported  as  a  negative  employer  contribution  in  the  change  in  other  postretirement  benefit  plan  assets.  The  amendments
facilitate targeted investment strategies that reflect each plan’s unique liability characteristics.

71

In fiscal 2021, we announced changes to the design of our health care coverage for certain eligible retirees to allow participants to
purchase  individual  health  insurance  policies  on  a  private  health  care  exchange  effective  January  1,  2022.  These  changes  provide
certain eligible retirees with greater flexibility in choosing health care coverage that best fits their needs.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

Assumed health care cost trends are as follows:

Health care cost trend rate for next year
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate

Fiscal Year

2023

2022

6.6% and 6.6 %
4.5  %
2032

5.9% and 6.0 %
4.5  %
2031

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to
remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption
is 6.6 percent for retirees age 65 and over and for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2023. Rates are graded down annually until
the  ultimate  trend  rate  of  4.5  percent  is  reached  in  2032  for  all  retirees.  The  trend  rates  are  applicable  for  calculations  only  if  the
retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate
the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for
health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

Postemployment Benefit Plans

Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United
States,  Canada,  and  Mexico.  We  recognize  an  obligation  for  any  of  these  benefits  that  vest  or  accumulate  with  service.
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years
of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

During  fiscal  2023  and  fiscal  2022,  the  decreases  in  defined  benefit  pension  obligations  and  other  postretirement  obligations  were
primarily driven by actuarial gains due to an increase in the discount rate in each respective year.

As  of  May  28,  2023,  other  postretirement  benefit  plans  had  benefit  obligations  of  $308.0 million  that  exceeded  plan  assets  of
$274.2 million. As of May 29, 2022, other postretirement benefit plans had benefit obligations of $332.4 million that exceeded plan
assets  of  $279.6 million.  Postemployment  benefit  plans  are  not  funded  and  had  benefit  obligations  of  $131.0 million  and
$138.5 million as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, respectively.

The  accumulated  benefit  obligation  for  all  defined  benefit  pension  plans  was  $5,807.9 million  as  of  May 28,  2023,  and
$6,330.0 million as of May 29, 2022.

We  estimate  the  service  and  interest  cost  components  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  expense  for  our  United  States  and  most  of  our
international  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and  postemployment  benefit  plans  utilizing  a  full  yield  curve
approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension,
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our
outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above
Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This
forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

(c)  Publicly  traded  common  stocks  in  energy,  real  estate,  and  infrastructure  for  the  purpose  of  total  return.  Investments  include:
energy,  real  estate,  and  infrastructure  securities  generally  valued  at  closing  prices  from  national  exchanges,  and  commingled
funds valued at unit values provided by the investment managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
(d)  Insurance and annuity contracts to provide a stable stream of income for pension retirees. Fair values are based on the fair value

of the underlying investments and contract fair values established by the providers.

(e)  Primarily limited partnerships, trust-owned life insurance, common collective trusts, and certain private equity securities that are
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been classified in the
fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers into or out of level 3 investments in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2022, the inclusion of non-observable inputs
into the pricing of certain private equity securities resulted in the transfer of $66.3 million into level 3 investments.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for
one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to
participants  at  a  reasonable  cost  to  us.  Our  goal  is  to  optimize  the  long-term  return  on  plan  assets  at  a  moderate  level  of  risk.  The
defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset
classes,  the  portfolios  are  further  diversified  across  investment  styles  and  investment  organizations.  For  the  U.S.  defined  benefit
pension  plans,  the  long-term  investment  policy  allocation  is:  9  percent  to  equities  in  the  United  States;  6  percent  to  international
equities; 7 percent to private equities; 68 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure).
For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 28 percent to equities in the United States;
14 percent to international equities; 14 percent to total private equities; and 44 percent to fixed income.  The actual allocations to these
asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments

We  do  not  expect  to  be  required  to  make  contributions  to  our  defined  benefit  pension,  other  postretirement  benefit,  and
postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2024. Actual fiscal 2024 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by
our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2033 as follows:

The  General  Mills  Savings  Plan  is  a  defined  contribution  plan  that  covers  domestic  salaried,  hourly,  nonunion,  and  certain  union
employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net
assets of $19.2 million as of May 28, 2023, and $20.6 million as of May 29, 2022. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many
of  our  foreign  locations.  Our  total  recognized  expense  related  to  defined  contribution  plans  was  $97.2  million  in  fiscal  2023,
$90.1 million in fiscal 2022, and $76.1 million in fiscal 2021.

We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment
options  of  the  participant’s  choosing.  The  number  of  shares  of  our  common  stock  allocated  to  participants  in  the  ESOP  was  3.7
million as of May 28, 2023, and 4.0 million as of May 29, 2022. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash
balances.

The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $498.7 million and $443.8 million of Company common stock as of May 28,
2023, and May 29, 2022, respectively.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence
does  not  suggest  we  will  realize  sufficient  taxable  income  of  the  appropriate  character  (e.g.,  ordinary  income  versus  capital  gain
income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits.

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA introduces a Corporate Alternative Minimum
Tax  beginning  in  our  fiscal  2024  and  an  excise  tax  on  the  repurchase  of  corporate  stock  starting  after  January  1,  2023.  We  do  not
currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our
liquidity. The amount of excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock was immaterial in fiscal 2023. We will continue to monitor
and assess the impact the IRA may have on our business and financial results.

On  March  11,  2021,  the  American  Rescue  Plan  Act  (ARPA)  was  signed  into  law.  The  ARPA  includes  a  provision  expanding  the
limitations on the deductibility of certain executive employee compensation beginning in our fiscal 2028. We do not currently expect
the ARPA to have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual estimated effective tax rate, or on our liquidity.

As of May 28, 2023, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our
foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely or the earnings
will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these
reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no
longer indefinitely reinvested. All earnings prior to fiscal 2018 remain permanently reinvested. Earnings from fiscal 2018 and later are
not permanently reinvested and local country withholding taxes are recorded on earnings each year.

We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years
may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the
timing  of  resolution  of  any  particular  uncertain  tax  position,  we  believe  that  our  liabilities  for  income  taxes  reflect  the  most  likely
outcome.  We adjust  these  liabilities,  as  well  as  the  related  interest,  in  light of  changing  facts  and  circumstances. Settlement  of  any
particular position would usually require the use of cash.

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdiction is the United States
(federal and state). Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which
vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing our federal tax returns for fiscal 2018 and 2019. Several state and foreign
examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results of operations
or financial position. We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.

The Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), has concluded audits of our 2012 through 2018 tax return
years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki
Alimentos  S.A.  The  RFB  has  proposed  adjustments  that  effectively  eliminate  the  goodwill  amortization  benefits  related  to  this
transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to continue to contest the disallowance for all years.

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.

80

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2023
and  fiscal  2022.  Approximately  $90 million  of  this  total  in  fiscal  2023  represents  the  amount  that,  if  recognized,  would  affect  our
effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because
certain portions of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal
income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

As of May 28, 2023, we do not expect to pay unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months. We
are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
outcomes. Our unrecognized tax benefit liability was classified in other liabilities.

We  report  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefit  liabilities  in  income  tax  expense.  For  fiscal  2023,  we
recognized $4.7 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $32.4 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 28,
2023. For fiscal 2022, we recognized $2.0 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $26.6 million of accrued interest
and penalties as of May 29, 2022.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As  of  May  28,  2023,  we  have  issued  guarantees  and  comfort  letters  of  $149.9 million  for  the  debt  and  other  obligations  of  non-
consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. Off-balance sheet arrangements were not material as of May 28, 2023.

During fiscal 2020, we received notice from the tax authorities of the State of São Paulo, Brazil regarding our compliance with its
state sales tax requirements. As a result, we have been assessed additional state sales taxes, interest, and penalties. We believe that we
have meritorious defenses against this claim and will vigorously defend our position. As of May 28, 2023, we are unable to estimate
any possible loss and have not recorded a loss contingency for this matter.

NOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We  operate  in  the  packaged  foods  industry.  In  fiscal  2022,  we  completed  a  new  organization  structure  to  streamline  our  global
operations.  This  global  reorganization  required  us  to  reevaluate  our  operating  segments.  Under  our  new  organization  structure,  our
chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about resources to be allocated to our operating segments as
follows: North America Retail, International, Pet, and North America Foodservice.

Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership
stores,  natural  food  chains,  drug,  dollar  and  discount  chains,  convenience  stores,  and  e-commerce  grocery  providers.  Our  product
categories  in  this  business  segment  include  ready-to-eat  cereals,  refrigerated  yogurt,  soup,  meal  kits,  refrigerated  and  frozen  dough
products,  dessert  and  baking  mixes,  frozen  pizza  and  pizza  snacks,  snack  bars,  fruit  snacks,  savory  snacks,  and  a  wide  variety  of
organic products including ready-to-eat cereal, frozen and shelf-stable vegetables, meal kits, fruit snacks and snack bars.

Our  International  operating  segment  consists  of  retail  and  foodservice  businesses  outside  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  Our
product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, meal kits, salty snacks, snack bars, dessert and baking mixes,
and  shelf  stable  vegetables.  We  also  sell  super-premium  ice  cream  and  frozen  desserts  directly  to  consumers  through  owned  retail
shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin
American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are
reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.

Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States and Canada in national pet superstore chains,
e-commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product

81

categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, vegetables and other high-quality
natural  ingredients.  Our  tailored  pet  product  offerings  address  specific  dietary,  lifestyle,  and  life-stage  needs  and  span  different
product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions, and textures and cuts for wet foods.

Our  North  America  Foodservice  segment  consists  of  foodservice  businesses  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.  Our  major  product
categories  in  our  North  America  Foodservice  operating  segment  are  ready-to-eat  cereals,  snacks,  refrigerated  yogurt,  frozen  meals,
unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and bakery flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer
and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice,
vending, and supermarket bakeries.

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment,
and  other  exit  costs.  Unallocated  corporate  items  include  corporate  overhead  expenses,  variances  to  planned  North  American
employee  benefits  and  incentives,  certain  charitable  contributions,  restructuring  initiative  project-related  costs,  gains  and  losses  on
corporate investments, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains
and  losses  arising  from  the  revaluation  of  certain  grain  inventories  and  gains  and  losses  from  mark-to-market  valuation  of  certain
commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the
corporate  level  and  are  excluded  from  the  measure  of  segment  profitability  reviewed  by  executive  management.  Under  our  supply
chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order
to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained
nor available by operating segment.

Glossary

AOCI. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Adjusted diluted EPS. Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Adjusted operating profit. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Adjusted operating profit margin. Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability, divided by net
sales.

Constant currency. Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the
rates  in  effect  for  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  To  present  this  information,  current  period  results  for  entities  reporting  in
currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the
corresponding  period  of  the  prior  fiscal  year,  rather  than  the  actual  average  exchange  rates  in  effect  during  the  current  fiscal  year.
Therefore,  the  foreign  currency  impact  is  equal  to  current  year  results  in  local  currencies  multiplied  by  the  change  in  the  average
foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.

Derivatives. Financial instruments such as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from
changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The calculation of earnings before income taxes and
after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, depreciation and amortization.

Euribor. European Interbank Offered Rate.

Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on
the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3
generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:

Level 1:  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:

  Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

Free cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of land, buildings, and equipment.

Free  cash  flow  conversion  rate.  Free  cash  flow  divided  by  our  net  earnings,  including  earnings  attributable  to  redeemable  and
noncontrolling interests adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are required to use in recording
and reporting accounting information in our financial statements.

Goodwill. The difference between the purchase price of acquired companies plus the fair value of any redeemable and noncontrolling
interests and the related fair values of net assets acquired.

Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales.

Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding
changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for certain hedging instruments and hedged
items  only  if  the  hedging  relationship  is  highly  effective,  and  only  prospectively  from  the  date  a  hedging  relationship  is  formally
documented.

Holistic Margin Management (HMM). Company-wide initiative to use productivity savings, mix management, and price realization
to offset input cost inflation, protect margins, and generate funds to reinvest in sales-generating activities.

87

Interest  bearing  instruments.  Notes  payable,  long-term  debt,  including  current  portion,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  certain
interest bearing investments classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.

LIBOR. London Interbank Offered Rate.

Mark-to-market. The act of determining a value for financial instruments, commodity contracts, and related assets or liabilities based
on the current market price for that item.

Net debt. Long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents.

Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

Net  mark-to-market valuation of  certain  commodity  positions.  Realized  and unrealized gains  and  losses on  derivative  contracts
that will be allocated to segment operating profit when the exposure we are hedging affects earnings.

Net price realization. The impact of list and promoted price changes, net of trade and other price promotion costs.

Net realizable value. The estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation.

Noncontrolling interests. Interests of consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties.

Notional principal amount. The principal amount on which fixed-rate or floating-rate interest payments are calculated.

OCI. Other comprehensive income (loss).

Operating  cash  flow  conversion  rate.  Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities,  divided  by  net  earnings,  including  earnings
attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests.

Operating cash flow to net debt ratio. Net debt divided by cash provided by operating activities.

Organic net sales growth. Net sales growth adjusted for foreign currency translation, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd
week impact, when applicable.

Project-related costs. Costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives not included in restructuring charges.

Redeemable  interest.  Interest  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  held  by  a  third  party  that  can  be  redeemed  outside  of  our  control  and
therefore cannot be classified as a noncontrolling interest in equity.

Reporting unit. An operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment.

SOFR. Secured Overnight Financing Rate.

Strategic  Revenue  Management  (SRM).  A  company-wide  capability  focused  on  generating  sustainable  benefits  from  net  price

purpose of consolidating our financial statements.

Working capital. Current assets and current liabilities, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.

ITEM 9A - Controls and Procedures

We, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated  the effectiveness of  the design  and operation of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures (as  defined  in  Rule
13a-15(e) under the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of May 28, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
reports  that  we  file  or  submit  under  the  1934  Act  is  (1)  recorded,  processed,  summarized,  and  reported  within  the  time  periods
specified in applicable rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act) during our
fiscal quarter ended May 28, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The  management  of  General  Mills,  Inc.  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in  Rule  13a-15(f)  under  the  1934  Act.  The  Company’s  internal  control  system  was  designed  to
provide  reasonable  assurance  to  our  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors  regarding  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of
published  financial  statements.  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of May 28, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

Based  on  our  assessment  using  the  criteria  set  forth  by  COSO  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013),  management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 28, 2023.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.
