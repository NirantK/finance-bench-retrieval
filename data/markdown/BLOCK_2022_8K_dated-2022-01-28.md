Entry
into
a
Material
Definitive
Agreement.

On January 28, 2022, Block, Inc. (formerly known as Square, Inc.) (“Block”) entered into the Fifth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement,

among Block, the lenders that are party thereto, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent (the “Revolver Amendment”). The Revolver
Amendment amends the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2020 (as amended by the First Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement, dated
as of May 28, 2020, the Second Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, the Third Amendment to Revolving Credit
Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2021, and the Fourth Amendment to Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2021), among Block, the lenders
that are party thereto, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, to permit certain existing obligations of Afterpay Limited and its
subsidiaries, including the SGX Notes (as defined below), to remain outstanding as of and after the completion of the Transaction (as defined below).

The foregoing description of the Revolver Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of

the Revolver Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Item
2.01

Completion
of
Acquisition
or
Disposition
of
Assets.

On January 31, 2022 (Pacific Standard Time)/February 1, 2022 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time), Block completed its previously announced

acquisition of all ordinary shares of Afterpay Limited, an Australian public company limited by shares and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange
(“Afterpay” and such shares, “Afterpay Shares”), pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of Australia’s Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) (the “Scheme” and such acquisition, the “Transaction”), as contemplated by the Scheme Implementation Deed (the “Deed”), dated as of August 1,
2021 (Pacific Daylight Time)/August 2, 2021 (Australian Eastern Standard Time) (as amended by the Amending Deed, dated as of December 6, 2021
(Pacific Standard Time) / December 7, 2021 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)), by and among Block, Afterpay and Lanai (AU) 2 Pty Ltd, an Australian
proprietary company limited by shares and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Block (“Block Acquirer”).

Upon the implementation of the Scheme, all Afterpay Shares issued and outstanding as of 12:00 a.m. on January 21, 2022 (Pacific Standard
Time) / 7:00 p.m. on January 21, 2022 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time), the record date for the Scheme, were transferred to Block Acquirer, and the
holders of such Afterpay Shares (“Scheme Participants”) became entitled to receive, for each such share, either (a) where such Scheme Participant was a
Share Elected Shareholder (as defined in the Deed), 0.375 shares of Block’s Class A common stock (“New Block Shares”); or (b) where such Scheme
Participant was a CDI Elected Shareholder (as defined in the Deed), 0.375 CHESS Depositary Interests, each representing an ownership interest in a share
of Block Class A common stock (“New Block CDIs”). In connection with the Transaction, 113,387,895 New Block Shares (including shares underlying
95,377,954 New Block CDIs) were issued to or for the benefit of Scheme Participants.

Equity awards held by non-employee directors of Afterpay vested in full and, if timely exercised (in the case of Afterpay stock options), participated

in the Scheme on the same basis as other Afterpay Shares. Outstanding equity awards of Afterpay and its subsidiaries held by employees were generally
treated as follows: (i) a portion of each Afterpay award vested such that the vested portion of the award equals the number of months of the total applicable
vesting period that had elapsed through January 10, 2022 divided by the total number of months in the vesting period, (ii) the vested portion of each
Afterpay award received New Block Shares or New Block CDIs (less any exercise price in the case of Afterpay stock options), and (iii) upon the
implementation of the Scheme, the unvested portion of each Afterpay award was forfeited and will be replaced by a Block award of the same character in a
manner that preserved its value and vesting schedule and generally on the same terms and conditions except that, for administrative convenience, certain
converted Block awards will have vesting dates that align with the vesting dates of other equity awards previously granted to Block employees.

The foregoing description of the Transaction, the Scheme and the Deed does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to

the full text of the Deed, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Arrangement
of
a
Registrant.

Afterpay is a party to the trust deed (the “Trust Deed”), dated as of March 12, 2021, by and between Afterpay and the Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Limited as trustee. The Trust Deed governs Afterpay’s A$1.5 billion Zero Coupon Convertible Notes due 2026 (the “SGX Notes”).
The SGX Notes have a maturity date of March 12, 2026 and do not bear interest. As described under Item 2.01 hereof, on January 31, 2022 (Pacific
Standard Time) / February 1, 2022 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time), Afterpay became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Block, and remains a
party to the Trust Deed.

On December 21, 2021 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time), Afterpay issued a notice of change of control (the “Relevant Event Notice”) to holders of

the SGX Notes following approval of the Scheme by Afterpay shareholders on December 14, 2021 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Within 60 days of
the delivery of the Relevant Event Notice, the holders of the SGX Notes may require Afterpay to redeem some or all of their SGX Notes at 100% of their
principal amount, and Afterpay is required to redeem such SGX Notes 10 business days after the end of such 60-day period, which redemption date will be
March 4, 2022 (Hong Kong Time).

The foregoing description of the Trust Deed and the SGX Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full

text of the Trust Deed, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The information set forth under Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

As described in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, Block issued 113,387,895 shares of Block Class A common stock (including shares

underlying the New Block CDIs) to or for the benefit of Afterpay shareholders in connection with the Transaction. The shares were issued in reliance on the
exemption afforded by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

In accordance with the terms of the Deed, Block’s board of directors (the “Board”) increased the size of the Board from twelve to thirteen directors
and appointed Sharon Rothstein, former director of Afterpay, to the Board as a Class III director, effective as of immediately following the closing of the
Transaction on January 31, 2022 (Pacific Standard Time) / February 1, 2022 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Other than the Deed, there is no
arrangement or understanding between Ms. Rothstein and any other persons pursuant to which Ms. Rothstein was selected as a director.

Ms. Rothstein, age 64, has served as an Operating Partner at Stripes, LLC (“Stripes”), a growth equity firm, since October 2018. Prior to joining

Stripes, Ms. Rothstein served as Executive Vice President, Global Chief Marketing Officer, and subsequently, as Executive Vice President, Global Chief
Product Officer of Starbucks Corporation from April 2013 to February 2018. Prior to joining Starbucks, Ms. Rothstein held senior marketing and brand
management positions with Sephora, Godiva, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Nabisco Biscuit Company and Procter & Gamble. Ms. Rothstein currently
serves on the boards of directors of Yelp Inc., InterContinental Hotels Group PLC and a number of privately-held companies. She previously served on the
board of directors of Afterpay until the closing of the Transaction. Ms. Rothstein holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of British Columbia
and an M.B.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles. Ms. Rothstein was selected to serve on the Board because of her marketing expertise and
global operations experience.

Ms. Rothstein will receive Block’s standard remuneration for non-employee directors in accordance with Block’s Outside Director Compensation

Policy, as described in the proxy statement relating to Block’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
April 29, 2021. Ms. Rothstein has also executed Block’s standard form of indemnification agreement.

3.5

Entitlement

holder

owner

Each Noteholder will (save as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or save as otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner of
each Note registered in its name for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any interest in it or
any writing on or the theft or loss of the Certificate issued in respect of it) and no person will be liable for so treating the holder. All payments made
to such holder shall be valid and, to the extent of the sums so paid, effective to satisfy and discharge the liability of the Trustee and/or the Issuer for
the moneys so payable under the Notes.

4

Stamp
Duties
and
Taxes

4.1

Stamp
Duty

The Issuer will pay any stamp, issue, registration, documentary, transfer or other taxes, duties, fees, assessments and government charges, including
interest and penalties, payable in any jurisdiction in respect of the creation, issue, initial offering and/or conversion of the Notes, the execution or
delivery of this Trust Deed and/or the Agency Agreement, the deposit of Certificates and Conversion Notices for the conversion of the Notes and/or
the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares following such deposit. The Trustee shall not be liable to pay any such taxes, duties, assessments and/or
government charges in any jurisdiction and shall not be concerned with, or obliged or required to enquire into, the sufficiency of any amount paid by
the Issuer or any Noteholder for this purpose and shall not be liable for any losses as a result of any non-payment by the Issuer or any Noteholder.
The Issuer will also indemnify the Trustee and the Noteholders, on demand on an after tax basis, from and against all stamp, issue, registration,
documentary, transfer or other taxes, duties, fees, assessments and government charges paid by any of them in any jurisdiction in connection with
any action taken in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed by or on behalf of the Trustee or, as the case may be, (where entitled under
Condition 15 to do so) the Noteholders to enforce the obligations of the Issuer under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Notes. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable to a Noteholder or any other person for:

(i)

determining whether a Noteholder or the Issuer is liable to pay any taxes or the amounts payable (if any) in connection with Condition
6(h); or

(ii)

determining the sufficiency or insufficiency of any amounts so paid and for any loss arising from a failure by it to do so.

The parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and/or the Notes no longer
being outstanding and/or the termination of this Trust Deed.

4.2

Change
of
Taxing
Jurisdiction

If the Issuer becomes subject generally to the taxing jurisdiction of any territory or any authority of or in that territory having power to tax other than
or in addition to the Commonwealth of Australia or any political subdivision or any authority thereof which imposes taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature with respect to this Trust Deed or the Notes then the Issuer will give to the Trustee an undertaking
satisfactory to the Trustee in terms corresponding to the terms of Condition 9 with the substitution for, or (as the case may require) the addition to,
the references in that Condition to the Commonwealth of Australia and any political subdivision or authority thereof of references to that other or
additional territory or authority to whose taxing jurisdiction the Issuer has become so subject. In such event, this Trust Deed and the Notes will be
read accordingly.

5

Further
Issues

5.1

Liberty
to
Create

The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders create and issue Further Notes having the same terms and conditions in all
respects as the Notes (or the same terms and conditions except for the issue date and the first date on which Conversion Rights may be exercised)
and so that such Further Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes or upon such terms as to interest, conversion, premium,
redemption and otherwise as the Issuer may determine at the time of their issue.

5.2 Means
of
Constitution

Any Further Notes created and issued pursuant to the provisions of Clause 5.1 above consolidated and forming a single series with the Notes shall be
constituted by a deed supplemental to this Trust Deed. In any such case, the Issuer shall prior to the issue of any Further Notes to be so consolidated
with the Notes execute and deliver to the Trustee a deed supplemental to this Trust Deed (in relation to which all applicable stamp duties or other
documentation Taxes have been paid by the Issuer, and, if applicable, duly stamped or denoted accordingly) and containing covenants by the Issuer
in the form mutatis mutandis of Clause 2 of this Trust Deed in relation to the principal amount and default interest in respect of such Further Notes
and such other provisions (whether or not corresponding to any of the provisions contained in this Trust Deed) as the Trustee shall require, and such
other documents and opinions as the Trustee may require in order to give effect to such issue of any such Further Notes.

5.3

Notice
of
Further
Issues

Whenever it is proposed to create and issue any Further Notes, the Issuer shall give to the Trustee not less than 7 days’ prior notice in writing of its
intention to do so, stating the amount of Further Notes proposed to be created and issued and providing confirmation that any conditions precedent
to the issue of Further Notes have been satisfied, which notice shall be accompanied by a draft of the proposed supplemental trust deed.

Application
of
Moneys
received
by
the
Trustee

6.1

Declaration
of
Trust

All moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the Notes or amounts payable under this Trust Deed will, regardless of any appropriation of all or
part of them by the Issuer, be held by the Trustee (subject to the provisions of Clause 6.2) upon trust to apply them:

6.1.1

first, in payment or satisfaction of all fees, all costs, charges and expenses properly incurred and all indemnities and liabilities incurred by
or payable to the Trustee (including remuneration payable to the Trustee) and any Appointee in carrying out its functions and/or exercising
its rights, powers and discretions under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes (which for the avoidance of doubt includes
the fees, costs, expenses, indemnities, charges and liabilities of the Agents and any Appointee for as long as they are acting as agents of, or
obliged to act on the instructions of, the Trustee);

10

6.1.2

secondly, in payment of any amounts of default interest owing in respect of the Notes pari passu and rateably;

6.1.3

thirdly, in payment of any amounts of principal owing in respect of the Notes pari passu and rateably;

6.1.4

fourthly, in payment of any other amounts owing in respect of the Notes pari passu and rateably;

6.1.5

fifthly, in payment or satisfaction of any and all amounts due and payable to each Agent but unpaid; and

6.1.6

sixthly, in payment of the balance (if any) to the Issuer.

Without prejudice to this Clause 6.1, if the Trustee holds any moneys which represent principal or default interest or other sums in respect of Notes
in respect of which claims have become prescribed under Condition 12, the Trustee will hold such moneys upon the trusts set out in this Clause 6.1.

6.2

Accumulation

If at any time the amount of the moneys available for payment in respect of the Notes under Clause 6.1 is less than 10 per cent. of the principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, the Trustee may, at its sole discretion, but shall be under no obligation to, place such moneys on deposit into
an account (and for the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not be required to obtain best rates or exercise any other form of investment discretion
with respect to such deposits, and it is acknowledged that an interest-bearing account may result in negative interest rates applying) in the name or
under the control of the Trustee at such bank or other financial institution and in such currency as the Trustee may think fit in light of the cash needs
of the transactions relating to the Notes and not for purposes of generating income. The Trustee may at its sole discretion retain such moneys and
accumulate the resulting income until the moneys and the accumulations, together with any other funds for the time being under its control and
available for such payment, amount to at least 10 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and then such moneys,
accumulations and funds (after deduction of, or provision for, any applicable taxes) will be applied as specified in Clause 6.1. If that bank or
institution is the Trustee or a subsidiary, holding or associated company of the Trustee, it need only account for an amount of interest equal to the
standard amount of interest payable by it on such a deposit to an independent customer. The Trustee may at any time vary or transpose any such
deposits or convert any moneys so deposited into any other currency. The Trustee will not be responsible or liable for any resulting loss, whether by
depreciation in value, changes in exchange rates, or interest rates or otherwise and shall not be liable for obtaining a return thereon which is less than
the return which may have been obtained if the relevant deposit was made in another form and/or with another institution.

11

applicable to Noteholders in the Agency Agreement shall be binding on the Noteholders. The Trustee shall be entitled to enforce the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and the Conditions as if the same were set out and contained in this Trust Deed which shall be read and construed as one
document with the Notes. The provisions contained in Schedule 3 shall have effect in the same manner as if herein set forth.

Noteholders or any other person for doing so) setting forth brief particulars of the event giving rise to the adjustment, the adjusted Conversion Price,
the date on which the adjustment takes effect and such other particulars and information as the Trustee may require; and

8.3.2
promptly thereafter give notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 of the adjustment to the Conversion Price and the date on

payments to the Noteholders and shall be payable on such dates as may be agreed between the Issuer and the Trustee. However, if any payment to a
Noteholder of the moneys due in respect of any Note is improperly withheld or refused, such remuneration will continue to accrue as from the date
of such withholding or refusal until payment to such Noteholder is duly made.

Remuneration

At any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default or if the Trustee is notified that such an event has occurred or
is about to occur, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee additional remuneration calculated at its normal hourly rates in force from time to time for such
additional time as may be in the opinion of the Trustee required to be spent by the Trustee as a result thereof. In any other case, in the event of any
proposed amendment, waiver or consent or if the Trustee finds it expedient in the interests of Noteholders or necessary, or is requested by the Issuer,
to undertake duties which the Trustee and the Issuer agree to be of an exceptional nature or otherwise outside the scope of the normal duties of the
Trustee under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes, the Issuer will pay such additional remuneration as may be agreed between
the Trustee and the Issuer or, failing agreement as to any of the matters in this sentence (or as to such sums referred to in Clause 10.1), as determined
by an independent investment bank (acting as an expert) selected by the Trustee and approved by the Issuer or failing such approval, nominated by
the President for the time being of The Law Society of England and Wales, the expenses involved in such selection and approval and the fee of such
independent investment bank being borne by the Issuer. The determination of such independent investment bank will, in the absence of fraud or
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Trustee and the Noteholders.

10.3 Expenses

The Issuer will also pay or discharge on demand in writing all costs, charges and expenses properly incurred and all liabilities incurred by the
Trustee in relation to the preparation and execution of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes, and the carrying out of its functions
and/or duties and/or the exercise of its rights, powers and discretions under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes, including, but
not limited to,

16

expenses incurred in seeking and obtaining legal, financial or other advice or information and travelling expenses, any amounts incurred in relation
to or as a result of the appointment or engagement of any Appointee and any capital, stamp, registration, documentary or other similar taxes or
duties paid by the Trustee in connection with any legal proceedings brought or contemplated by the Trustee against the Issuer for enforcing any
obligation under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Notes.

10.4

Payment
of
Expenses

All costs, charges and expenses properly incurred and payments thereof properly made and all liabilities incurred by the Trustee will be payable or
reimbursable by the Issuer on demand by the Trustee and:

10.4.1

in the case of payments made by the Trustee prior to such demand will (if not paid on demand) carry interest from the date on which the
demand is made at the rate of two per cent. per annum over the Trustee’s cost of funds (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) on the
date on which the Trustee made such payments, as notified by the Trustee; and

10.4.2

in all other cases, will carry interest at such rate from five days after the date on which the demand is made or (where the demand specifies
that payment is to be made on an earlier date) from such earlier date.

10.5

Indemnity

The Issuer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably covenants and undertakes, on demand, to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee, its directors,
officers, employees and Appointees (each in this Clause 10 an “indemnified
party”) in full at all times on an after tax basis against all losses,
liabilities, actions, proceedings, claims, demands, penalties, damages, costs, fees, expenses disbursements, and other liabilities whatsoever
(“Losses”), including without limitation the properly incurred costs and expenses of legal advisers and other experts, which may be suffered or
brought against or may be incurred by such indemnified party as a result of or in connection with:

(i)

(ii)

its appointment or involvement hereunder or the exercise of any of their rights, discretions and/or powers or performance of any of their
duties hereunder or under the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes or the taking of any acts in accordance with the terms of or as
contemplated in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes or its usual practice; or

any instruction, certificate, communication, document or other direction upon which the Trustee may rely under this Trust Deed, the
Agency Agreement and/or the Notes as well as the costs and expenses incurred by an indemnified party of defending itself against or
investigating any claim or liability with respect of the foregoing,

provided that this indemnity shall not apply in respect of an indemnified party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any
such Losses incurred or suffered by or brought against such indemnified party arise directly from the fraud, wilful default or gross negligence of
such indemnified party. For the avoidance of doubt, this indemnity shall not extend to any income tax payable by the Trustee or any other
indemnified party in respect of any normal remuneration or additional remuneration paid to the Trustee pursuant to Clauses 10.1 or 10.2 but the
foregoing is without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under Clause 10.6. Any indemnified party may enforce the provisions of this Clause
10.5 in accordance with the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

17

10.6 Taxes

The Issuer hereby further undertakes to the Trustee that all moneys payable by it to the Trustee or any other indemnified party under this Clause 10,
Clause 4.1 and Clause 19 shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of and without withholding for or deduction of any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or in any
jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or by an authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is
required by Applicable Law. In the event that any such withholding or deduction in respect of any such payment is required by Applicable Law, the
Issuer shall pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Trustee or any other
indemnified party after such withholding or deduction shall equal the amounts which would have been receivable by it had no such withholding or
deduction been required.

10.7

Interest

All remuneration payable to the Trustee that is not paid on the due date thereof shall carry interest from such due date at the rate of two per cent. per
annum over its the Trustee’s cost of funds prevailing at the due date of such payment, as notified by the Trustee, until the date of payment of such
remuneration in full.

10.8

Provisions
Continuing

The provisions of Clauses 10.3 to 10.7 (both inclusive) shall continue in full force and effect even if the Trustee is no longer the Trustee and/or the
Notes are no longer outstanding and/or this Trust Deed has been terminated.

(i)

(ii)

to have been passed at a meeting of Noteholders in respect of which minutes have been made and signed; or

even though it may later be found that there was a defect in the constitution of such meeting or the passing of such resolution or the obtaining of
such consent or that such resolution or such consent was not valid or binding on the Noteholders.

11.5

Illegality/Expenditure
of
Trustee
Funds

(i)

may be illegal or contrary to any Applicable Law (including, without limitation, Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act), directive or fiscal requirement of any governmental agency or state or jurisdiction or any court order or arbitral
award;

19

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

it would not have power to do the relevant thing in that state or jurisdiction by virtue of any applicable law in that state or jurisdiction or if

may cause the Trustee to be considered a sponsor of a covered fund under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and any regulations promulgated thereunder; or

may cause it to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the

the liability is not assured to it.

Furthermore, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the Conditions, the Trustee may:

(a)

(b)

refrain from doing anything which would or might in its opinion be contrary to the rules, operating procedures or market practice of any
relevant stock exchange or other market or clearing system on which the Notes are listed or through which the Notes are held and/or
cleared, or which would or might otherwise render it liable to any person in any state or jurisdiction; and

do anything which is, in its opinion, necessary to comply with any of the aforementioned Applicable Laws, directives, fiscal requirements,
court orders, arbitral awards, rules, operating procedures or market practice.

11.6 Certificate
Signed
by
Authorised
Officers

If the Trustee, in the exercise or performance of its functions, duties, rights, powers and/or discretions under this Trust Deed, the Agency
Agreement, the Notes or any other document to which the Trustee is a party in its capacity as such, requires to be satisfied or to have information as

or any written communication signed by an authorised officer as to that fact or to the effect that, in the opinion of the Issuer, that act is expedient and
the Trustee need not call for further evidence and will not be responsible or liable to any Noteholder or any other person for any loss that may be
occasioned by relying or acting on any such certificate.

11.7 Deposit
of
Documents

respect thereof, at the cost of the Issuer, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for or required to insure against any loss incurred in connection
with such deposit. The Trustee is not obliged to appoint a custodian of securities payable to bearer.

11.8 Discretion

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Conditions, the Trustee will have absolute and

20

Agency Agreement, the Notes, the Conditions and any other transaction documents and will not be responsible for any loss, liability, cost, claim,
action, demand, expense or inconvenience which may result from their exercise or non-exercise. Whenever in this Trust Deed, the Agency
Agreement and the Notes or by law, the Trustee shall have any discretion or permissive power, it may decline to exercise the same in the absence of
approval by or directions or instructions from the Noteholders by way of an Extraordinary Resolution, and shall be entitled to refrain from acting if
any approval, direction or instruction received from Noteholders is not clear, and shall not be liable for not acting in any such circumstances. The
Trustee shall not be bound to exercise any discretion or power or act at the request or direction of the Noteholders unless first indemnified and/or
secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction against all actions, proceedings, claims and demands to which, in its opinion, it may render itself liable
and all costs, charges, damages, expenses and liabilities it may incur by doing so. As between the Trustee and the Noteholders, the exercise of such
discretion shall be conclusive and binding. The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or liability incurred by any person as a result of
any delay in it exercising any such discretion or power or in taking any action, making any decision, or giving any direction where the Trustee is
seeking such directions or instructions or where directions or instructions sought are not provided by the holders of the Notes. The Trustee shall not
be liable to the Issuer or any other person for any loss, costs, charges, liabilities and expenses incurred or suffered by the Issuer or any other person
where it is acting on the instructions or at the direction of the Noteholders (whether given by Extraordinary Resolution or otherwise as contemplated
or permitted by this Trust Deed and/or the Notes).

11.9 Agents

Whenever it considers it expedient in the interests of the Noteholders, the Trustee may, in the conduct of its trust business, instead of acting
personally, without the permission of any other party, employ and pay an agent (at the expense of the Issuer) selected by it, whether or not a lawyer

required to be done by the Trustee (including the receipt and payment of money).

The Trustee may (at the expense of the Issuer), without the permission of any other party, in the execution and exercise of all or any of the trusts,
rights, powers, authorities and discretions vested in it by this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Conditions, act by responsible officers or a
responsible officer for the time being of the Trustee and the Trustee may also whenever it thinks fit, whether by power of attorney or otherwise,
delegate to any person or persons or fluctuating body of persons (whether being a joint trustee of this Trust Deed or not) all or any of the trusts,
powers, authorities and discretions vested in it by this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes and any such delegation may be made
upon such terms and conditions and subject to such regulations (including power to sub-delegate with the consent of the Trustee) as the Trustee may
think fit in the interests of the Noteholders.

and
Custodians

appoint any person to act as its nominee or custodian on any terms.

21

11.12 Forged
Entry
on
the
Registrar

The Trustee will not be liable to the Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person by reason of having accepted as valid or not having rejected any
Certificate or entry in the Register purporting to be such and later found to be forged or not authentic, nor shall it be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance on any document, certificate or communication believed by it to be genuine and to have been presented or signed by
the proper party.

11.13 Confidentiality

Unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental authority or regulatory body in any jurisdiction or as required by
applicable law or regulation, the Trustee shall not be required to disclose to any Noteholder or any other person any confidential financial or other
information made available to the Trustee by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and no Noteholder shall be entitled to take any action to obtain
from the Trustee any such information.

11.14 Determinations
Conclusive

As between itself and the Noteholders, the Trustee may determine all questions and doubts arising in relation to any of the provisions of this Trust
Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes. Every such determination, whether made upon such a question actually raised or implied in the acts or
proceedings of the Trustee, will be conclusive and shall bind all other parties and the Noteholders.

11.15 Currency
Conversion

Where it is necessary or desirable for any purpose in connection with the terms of this Trust Deed or the Conditions to convert any sum from one
currency to another, it will (unless otherwise provided herein or in the Conditions or required by law) be converted at such rate or rates, in
accordance with such method and as at such date as may be specified by the Trustee in its discretion but having regard to current rates of exchange,
if available. Any rate, method and date so specified will be binding on the Issuer and the Noteholders.

11.16 Events
of
Default
etc.

The Trustee may, but is not obliged to, determine in its absolute discretion whether or not an Event of Default, a Potential Event of Default or a
Relevant Event or any other proposed action or any circumstance is in its opinion capable of remedy and/or materially prejudicial to the interests of
the Noteholders. Any such determination will be conclusive and binding on the Issuer and the Noteholders. The Trustee will not be responsible or
liable to the Issuer or any Noteholder or any other person for any loss arising from a failure to make such a determination. Without prejudice to the
foregoing, the Trustee is not obliged to make a determination under this Clause 11.16 unless first indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to
its satisfaction against all actions, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may in its opinion render itself liable and all costs, charges,
damages, expenses and liabilities which it may in its opinion incur by so doing.

11.17 Payment
for
and
Delivery
of
Notes

The Trustee will not be responsible for the receipt or application by the Issuer of the proceeds of the issue of the Notes, any conversion of Notes or
the delivery of Notes to the persons entitled to them.

22

11.18 Acceleration

The Trustee shall not be obliged to declare the Notes immediately due and payable under Condition 10 unless the Trustee is so requested in writing
by Noteholders holding at least 25 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding or so directed by an Extraordinary
Resolution and unless in any such case it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction in respect of all costs, claims,
liabilities, actions, proceedings, demands, penalties, damages, fees, disbursements and expenses which it has incurred to that date and to which it
may thereby and as a consequence thereof in its opinion render itself, or have rendered itself, liable.

11.19 Notes
Held
by
the
Issuer
etc.

In the absence of express written notice to the contrary, the Trustee may assume without enquiry and liability (other than requesting a certificate
under Clause 9.12) that no Notes are for the time being held by or on behalf of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries.

11.20 Responsibility
for
Agents
etc.

Provided that the Trustee exercises due care in selecting any custodian, agent, delegate or nominee appointed under this Trust Deed (each an
“Appointee”), it will not have any obligation to supervise or monitor the Appointee and shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, liability, cost,
claim, action, demand or expense incurred by reason of the Appointee’s act, omission, misconduct or default or the act, omission, misconduct or
default of any substitute appointed by the Appointee.

11.21 Interests
of
Holders
through
the
Clearing
Systems

In considering the interests of Noteholders while the Global Certificate is held on behalf of, or registered in the name of any nominee for, a clearing
system, the Trustee may have regard to any certificate, report or any other information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator as to the
identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to the Notes evidenced by the Global Certificate and may
consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes represented by the Global Certificate. The Trustee may call for any
certificate or other document to be issued by the relevant clearing system as to the principal amount of Notes evidenced by the Global Certificate
standing to the account of any person. Any such certificate or other document shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for
all purposes. The Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person by reason of having accepted as valid or not having
rejected any certificate or other document to such effect purporting to be issued by the relevant clearing system and subsequently found to be forged
or not authentic or not to be correct.

11.22 No
responsibility
for
Recitals
etc.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for recitals, statements, warranties, representations, statements or covenants of any other party contained in this
Trust Deed or any other transaction document relating to the Notes or other document entered into in connection therewith, nor shall the Trustee by
the execution of this Trust Deed be deemed to make any representation as to the validity, sufficiency or enforceability of the Notes or this Trust
Deed. The Trustee shall be entitled to assume the accuracy and correctness thereof.

admissibility in evidence of, or for any matter or thing done or omitted in any way in connection with or in relation to, this Trust Deed, the Agency
Agreement or any other document relating hereto or thereto, any licence,

23

consent or other authority for the execution, delivery, legality, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity, performance, enforceability or
admissibility in evidence of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or any other document relating hereto or thereto. In addition the Trustee shall
not be responsible to the Noteholders or any other person for the effect of the exercise or non-exercise of any of its rights, powers, duties and/or
discretions hereunder except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Trustee’s own gross negligence, wilful default or
fraud was the primary and direct cause of any loss to the Noteholders or such other person.

Neither the Trustee nor any of the Agents shall be responsible for monitoring or in any way ascertaining the existence, coming into effect or change
of the laws or regulations related to the obligations of the Issuer under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Conditions or any
governmental or regulatory consents, approval, authorisation, resolution, licence or exemption required by the Issuer in relation thereto, or to
ascertain whether any certification, if applicable, shall have been done by the Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person and shall not be liable for
any failure by the Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person to obtain or maintain any governmental or regulatory consent, approval, authorisation,
resolution, licence or exemption and/or to provide any such certification.

for
the

responsibility for the same and no Noteholder shall rely on the Trustee in respect thereof.

outstanding or shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution and, in any such case, it shall first have been indemnified and/or secured
and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction. The Trustee shall incur no liability to the Noteholders or any other person for taking or refraining from taking
such steps, actions and/or proceedings. No Noteholder will be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee, having become
bound to do so, fails to do so within a reasonable period and such failure shall be continuing.

11.25 Consent

Any consent to be given, or any right, discretion or power to be exercised, by the Trustee for the purposes of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement

of business, goodwill, reputation, opportunity or profits or anticipated saving, in each case howsoever caused and whether arising directly or
indirectly and whether or not foreseeable, even if the Trustee is actually aware of or has been advised of the likelihood of such special or punitive
damages, indirect or consequential loss or damages and regardless of whether the claim for such loss or damages is made in negligence, for breach
of contract, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary obligation or otherwise. The provisions of this Clause 11.27 shall survive the termination of this
Trust Deed and/or the Notes no longer being outstanding and/or the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

11.28 Interests
of
Noteholders

In connection with the exercise of its rights, powers, trusts, authorities or discretions (including, but not limited to, those in relation to any proposed

hereunder or thereunder if it is prevented from so performing its obligations or exercising its rights, powers and/or discretions by any circumstances
beyond the control of the Trustee, or resulting from the general risks of investment in or the holding of assets in any jurisdiction, including, without
limitation, any existing or future law, order, judgment or regulation, any existing or future act of a supranational or regulatory body, judicial

cause of any loss to the Noteholders or the Issuer. Liabilities arising under this Clause 11.31 shall be limited to the amount of the Issuer’s actual
loss. Such actual loss shall be determined (i) as at the date of the action or inaction on the part of the Trustee amounting to such gross negligence,

of the Trustee):

(i)

(ii)

by the Trustee, where necessary to perform the Trustee’s obligations under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes; or

where the disclosing party is under a legal or regulatory obligation to disclose, where the Applicable Law permits it to do so or where the
disclosing party has been requested to do so by any legal, regulatory, governmental or fiscal body in any jurisdiction.

The Trustee may collect, use and disclose personal data about the Issuer (if it is an individual) or individuals associated with the Issuer (whether or
not it is an individual), so that the Trustee can carry out its obligations to the Issuer and for other related purposes, including auditing, monitoring
and analysis of its business, fraud and crime prevention, money laundering, legal and regulatory compliance, and the marketing by the Trustee or

26

members of the HSBC Group of other services. The Trustee may also transfer the personal data to any country (including countries outside where
the Trustee provides the services to be provided under the terms of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes where there may be less
stringent data protection laws) to process information on the Trustee’s behalf. Wherever it is processed by the Trustee or its agents or delegates
within the HSBC Group, the personal data will be protected with security measures and a degree of care to which all members of the HSBC Group
and their staff are subject and will only be used in accordance with the Trustee’s instructions.

11.33 Error
of
Judgment

The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made by any officer, director, agent or employee of the Trustee assigned by the Trustee to
administer its corporate trust matters.

11.34 Right
to
Deduct
or
Withhold

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes, to the extent required by any Applicable Law, if
the Trustee is or will be required to make any deduction or withholding from any distribution or payment made or to be made by it hereunder or in
relation to the notes or if the Trustee is or will be otherwise charged to, or is or may become liable to, tax as a consequence of performing its duties
hereunder whether as principal, agent or otherwise, and whether by reason of any assessment, prospective assessment or other imposition of liability
to taxation of whatsoever nature and whensoever made upon the Trustee, and whether in connection with or arising from any sums received or
distributed by it or to which it may be entitled under this Trust Deed (other than in connection with its remuneration as provided for herein) or any
investments or deposits from time to time representing the same, including any income or gains arising therefrom or any action of the Trustee in
connection with the trusts of this Trust Deed (other than the remuneration herein specified) or otherwise, then the Trustee shall be entitled to make
such deduction or withholding or, as the case may be, to retain out of sums received by it an amount sufficient to discharge any liability to tax which
relates to sums so received or distributed or to discharge any such other liability of the Trustee to tax from the funds held by the Trustee upon the
trusts of this Trust Deed, and shall account to the relevant Authority for the amount so withheld or deducted, or, at its option, shall reasonably
promptly after making such payment return to the Issuer the amount so deducted or withheld or retained, in which case, the Issuer shall so account to
the relevant Authority for such amount. If Taxes are paid by the Trustee, the Issuer agrees that it shall promptly reimburse the Trustee for such
payment to the extent not covered by deduction or withholding from any payment or debited from any balance held for it. The Issuer shall remain
liable for any deficiency and agrees that it shall pay any such deficiency promptly upon notice from the Trustee or any Authority. In any event, the
Trustee shall not be obliged to gross up any such distribution or to pay any additional amounts to the intended recipient of the distribution or
payment as a result of making such deduction or withholding and shall not be liable to the Issuer, the Noteholders or any other person for any of the
aforesaid. For the avoidance of doubt, FATCA Withholding is a deduction or withholding which is deemed to be required by Applicable Law for the
purposes of this Clause 11.34.

11.35 Undertaking
Regarding
Information
Reporting
and
Collection
Obligations

Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Trust Deed, the Issuer shall, within ten business days of a written request by the Trustee, supply to
the Trustee such forms, documentation and other information relating to it, its operations, or the Notes as the Trustee

27

reasonably requests for the purposes of the compliance by the Trustee with Applicable Law and shall notify the Trustee promptly in the event that it
becomes aware that any of the forms, documentation or other information provided by it is (or becomes) inaccurate in any material respect;
provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to provide any forms, documentation or other information pursuant to this Clause 11.35 to
the extent that:

(i)

any such form, documentation or other information (or the information required to be provided on such form or documentation) is not
reasonably available to the Issuer and cannot be obtained by the Issuer using reasonable efforts; or

(ii)

doing so would or might in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer constitute a breach of any:

(a)

(b)

(c)

Applicable Law;

fiduciary duty; or

duty of confidentiality.

11.36 Notice
of
Possible
Withholding

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing in the event that it determines that any payment to be made by the Trustee under the Notes is a payment
which could be subject to any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes including, without limitation, under FATCA, if such
payment were made to a recipient that is generally unable to receive payments free from any deduction or withholding for or on account of any
Taxes including, without limitation, under FATCA, and the extent to which the relevant payment is so treated, provided, however, that the
obligations of the Issuer under this Clause 11.36 shall apply only to the extent that such payments are so treated by virtue of characteristics of the
Issuer, the Notes, or both.

11.37 Tax
Indemnity

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Deed, the Issuer shall indemnify the Trustee on demand against any liability or loss howsoever
incurred in connection with the Issuer’s obligation to withhold or deduct an amount for or on account of Tax including, without limitation, FATCA
Withholding.

11.38 Legal
Opinions

The Trustee shall not be responsible to any person for:

(i)

(ii)

failing to request, require or receive any legal opinion relating to the Notes, this Trust Deed and/or the Agency Agreement; or

checking or commenting upon the content of any such legal opinion; or

(iii)

the content of any such legal opinion,

and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any loss, liability, cost, claim, action, demand, expense or inconvenience incurred and resulting thereby.

28

11.39 Consolidation,
amalgamation
etc.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for any consolidation, amalgamation, merger, reconstruction or scheme of the Issuer or any sale or transfer of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or the form or substance of any plan relating thereto or the consequences thereof to any Noteholder.

11.40 Waiver
of
Conflicts

The Issuer hereby irrevocably waives, in favour of the Trustee, any conflict of interest which may arise by virtue of the Trustee or any affiliate of the
Trustee acting in various capacities under the Agency Agreement, this Trust Deed and any other documents relating to the Notes or for other
customers of the Trustee or any affiliate of the Trustee. The Issuer hereby acknowledges that the Trustee and its affiliates (together, the “Trustee
Parties”) may have interests in, or may be providing or may in the future provide financial or other services to, other parties with interests which an
issuer may regard as conflicting with its interests and may possess information (whether or not material to the Issuer) that the Trustee Parties may
not be entitled to share with the Issuer.

11.41 Anti-Money
Laundering
and
Terrorism

In connection with HSBC Group’s commitment to comply with all applicable sanctions regimes, the Trustee and any affiliate or subsidiary of HSBC
Holdings plc may take any action in its sole and absolute discretion that it considers appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, request of a
public or regulatory authority, any agreement between any member of the HSBC Group and any government authority or any HSBC Group policy
that relates to the prevention of fraud, money laundering, terrorism, tax evasion, evasion of economic or trade sanctions or other criminal activities
(collectively the “Relevant
Requirements”). Such action may include, but is not limited to, (i) screening, intercepting and investigating any
transaction, instruction or communication, including the source of, or intended recipient of, funds; (ii) delaying or preventing the processing of
instructions or transactions or the Trustee’s performance of its obligations under this Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement; (iii) the blocking of
any payment; or (iv) requiring the Issuer to enter into a financial crime compliance representations letter from time to time in a form and substance
acceptable to the HSBC Group.

To the extent permissible by law, neither the Trustee nor any member of the HSBC Group will be liable for loss (whether direct or consequential
and including, without limitation, loss of profit or interest) or damage suffered by any party arising out of, or caused in whole or in part by, any
actions that are taken by the Trustee or any other member of the HSBC Group to comply with any Relevant Requirement.

“HSBC
Group” means HSBC Holdings plc together with its subsidiary undertakings from time to time.

11.42 Not
Responsible
for
Listing

Nothing in this Trust Deed shall require the Trustee to assume an obligation of the Issuer arising under any provision of the listing, prospectus,
disclosure or transparency rules (or equivalent rules of any other applicable competent Authority).

11.43 No
Implied
Duties

The Trustee shall be obliged to perform such duties, and only such duties, as are herein or in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or the
Conditions, as applicable, specifically set forth, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into such documents against the Trustee.

29

11.44 Rights,
Powers,
Discretions
and
Functions
Additional

The rights, powers, discretions and functions conferred on the Trustee by this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Conditions shall be in

11.45 Determinations
relating
to
Indemnification

The Trustee shall, when determining whether an indemnity or any security or pre-funding is satisfactory to it, be entitled to:

(i)

(ii)

evaluate its risk in any given circumstance by considering the worst-case scenario; and

require that any indemnity or security given to it by the Noteholders or any of them be given on a joint and several basis and be supported
by evidence satisfactory to it as to the financial standing and creditworthiness of each counterparty and/or as to the value of the security
and an opinion as to the capacity, power and authority of each counterparty and/or the validity and effectiveness of the security.

11.46 Regulatory
position

Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes or any other transaction document to the contrary, the Trustee
shall not do, or be authorised or required to do, anything which might constitute a regulated activity for the purpose of Part 1 of Schedule 5 of the
Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (the “SFO”), unless it is authorised under the SFO to do so. The Trustee
shall have the discretion at any time:

(i)

(ii)

to delegate any of the functions which fall to be performed by an authorised person under the SFO to any other agent or person which also
has the necessary authorisations and licences; and

to apply for authorisation under the SFO and perform any or all such functions itself if, in its absolute discretion, it considers it necessary,
desirable or appropriate to do so.

11.47 Further
Rights

The Trustee shall be entitled to:

(i)

(ii)

enter into business transactions with the Issuer and/or any entity related to the Issuer and to act as trustee, agent, depositary and/or
custodian for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and any entity relating to the Issuer;

exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the

and other communications to the Trustee shall not be valid unless such notice is delivered to the Trustee in writing.

12

Trustee
liable
for
negligence

Section 1 of the Trustee Act 2000 shall not apply to any function of the Trustee provided that nothing in this Trust Deed shall relieve or indemnify
the Trustee from or against any liability which would otherwise attach to it in respect of any gross negligence, wilful default or fraud which it may
be guilty of in relation to its duties under this Trust Deed, taking into account the provisions of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the
Notes.

Where there are any inconsistencies between the Trustee Act 1925, the Trustee Act 2000 and the provisions of this Trust Deed, the provisions of this
Trust Deed shall, to the extent allowed by law, prevail and, in the case of any such inconsistency with the Trustee Act 2000, the provisions of this
Trust Deed shall constitute a restriction or exclusion for the purposes of that Act.

13

Proof
of
Default

Proof that the Issuer has failed to pay a sum due to the holder of any one Note will (unless the contrary be proved) be sufficient evidence that it has
made the same default as regards all other Notes which are then payable.

14

Trustee
not
precluded
from
entering
into
Contracts

None of the Trustee or any director or officer of a corporation acting as a Trustee, whether acting for itself or in any other capacity, or any other
person will be precluded from becoming the owner of, or acquiring any interest in, or holding, or disposing of, any Notes or any Ordinary Shares or
securities of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, holding companies or associated companies with the same rights as it would have had if the Trustee
were not the Trustee or from entering into or being interested in any contracts or transactions with the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, holding or
associated companies or from acting on, or as depositary or agent for, any committee or body of holders of any securities of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries, holding or associated companies and will not be liable to account for any profit resulting therefrom.

15

Modification
and
Waiver

The Trustee may (but shall not be obliged to) agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to:

(i)

(ii)

any modification to this Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental
to the Agency Agreement, the Notes or the Conditions which, in the Trustee’s opinion, is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to
correct a manifest error or is made to comply with mandatory provisions of law; and

any other modification (except as mentioned in this Trust Deed) to, or the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, or
any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default under, this Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to this Trust Deed, the Agency
Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Notes or the Conditions which is not, in the opinion of the Trustee,
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

31

Any such modification, waiver or authorisation will be binding on the Noteholders and, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, any such modification,
waiver or authorisation will be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 and to the Agents as soon as practicable
thereafter. Each of the Agents and the Trustee shall not be bound by any changes to this Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to this Trust Deed,
the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement or the Notes which affect their respective duties, obligations, rights
or liabilities, unless such changes have been agreed to by the Agents or the Trustee (as the case may be).

16

Substitution

16.1 Conditions
for
substitution

The Trustee may (but shall not be obliged to), without the consent of the Noteholders, agree with the Issuer to the substitution in place of the Issuer
(or any previous substitute under this Clause 16) as the principal debtor under the Notes and this Trust Deed of any Subsidiary of the Issuer
(the “Substituted
Obligor”), provided that the Notes continuing to be convertible or exchangeable into Ordinary Shares as provided in the
Conditions mutatis mutandis as provided in the Conditions, with such amendments as the Trustee shall consider appropriate, provided that in any
such case:

16.1.1

the Trustee is satisfied in its discretion that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution;

16.1.2

the Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Issuer;

16.1.3

16.1.4

a deed is executed or undertaking given by the Substituted Obligor to the Trustee, in form and manner satisfactory to the Trustee in its
discretion, agreeing to be bound by this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes (with consequential amendments as the Trustee
may deem appropriate) as if the Substituted Obligor had been named in this Trust Deed and the Notes as the principal debtor in place of the
Issuer;

if the Substituted Obligor is subject generally to the taxing jurisdiction of a territory or any authority of or in that territory with power to tax
(the “Substituted
Territory”) other than the territory to the taxing jurisdiction of which (or to any such authority of or in which) the Issuer
is subject generally (the “Issuer’s
Territory”), the Substituted Obligor will (unless the Trustee in its absolute discretion otherwise agrees)
give to the Trustee an undertaking satisfactory to the Trustee in its discretion in terms corresponding to Condition 9 with the substitution
for the references in that Condition to the Issuer’s Territory of references to the Substituted Territory whereupon this Trust Deed and the
Notes will be read accordingly;

16.1.5

if any director, the company secretary or the chief financial officer (or any person acting in any of those capacities) of the Substituted
Obligor certifies that the Substituted Obligor will be solvent immediately after such substitution, the Trustee need not have regard to the
Substituted Obligor’s financial condition, profits or prospects or compare them with those of the Issuer;

32

16.1.6

the SGX-ST (or, if applicable such other stock exchange or competent listing authority on which the Notes may be listed and/or admitted to
trading pursuant to Clause 9.10) shall have confirmed to the Issuer that, after giving effect to such substitution, the Notes shall continue to
be listed and traded on the SGX-ST (or, if applicable such other stock exchange or competent listing authority on which the Notes may be
listed and/or admitted to trading pursuant to Clause 9.10); and

16.1.7

the Issuer and the Substituted Obligor comply with such other requirements as the Trustee may in its discretion direct in the interests of the
Noteholders.

The Trustee may in the event of such substitution in its discretion agree without the consent of the Noteholders to a change of law governing this
Trust Deed and/or the Notes provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders.

16.2 Release
of
Issuer
and
Substitute
Obligor

Any such agreement by the Trustee pursuant to this Clause 16 will, if so expressed, operate to release the Issuer (or any such previous substitute)
from any or all of its obligations under this Trust Deed and the Notes as Issuer but will be without prejudice to its obligations as guarantor of the
Substituted Obligor.

16.3 Completion
of
Substitution

Upon the execution of such documents and compliance with such requirements, the Substituted Obligor will be deemed to be named in this Trust
Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes as the principal debtor in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Clause 16) and this
Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes will be deemed to be modified in such manner as shall be necessary to give effect to the
substitution. Any such substitution shall be binding on the Noteholders and shall be notified promptly to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 17 and to the Trustee.

16.4

Further
Assurances
of
Issuer

The Issuer hereby agrees that it will as soon as practicable give, execute and deliver all such documents and do or cause to be done all such acts as
may be necessary or desirable to effect any substitution contemplated by this Clause 16.

17

Appointment,
Retirement
and
Removal
of
the
Trustee

17.1 Appointment

The Issuer will have the power of appointing new trustees but no person will be so appointed unless previously approved by an Extraordinary
Resolution of Noteholders. A trust corporation will at all times be a Trustee and may be the sole Trustee. Any appointment of a new Trustee will be
notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 17.

17.2 Retirement
and
Removal

Any Trustee may retire at any time on giving not less than 45 calendar days’ prior notice in writing to the Issuer without giving any reason and
without being responsible for any costs occasioned by such retirement or the appointment of a new trustee and the Noteholders may by
Extraordinary Resolution remove any Trustee, provided that the retirement or removal of any sole trustee or sole trust corporation will not become
effective until a trust

33

corporation is appointed as successor Trustee. If a sole trustee or sole trust corporation gives notice of retirement or an Extraordinary Resolution is
passed for its removal under this Clause 17.2, the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to procure that another trust corporation be appointed as
Trustee, but if the Issuer has failed to do so within 30 calendar days of such notice being given or of the date of such Extraordinary Resolution, the
Trustee may, at the cost of the Issuer, exercise the power of appointing a successor trustee.

17.3 Co-Trustees

The Trustee may, despite Clause 17.1, by notice in writing to the Issuer appoint anyone to act as an additional Trustee jointly with the Trustee:

17.3.1

if the Trustee considers such appointment to be in the interests of the Noteholders;

17.3.2

17.3.3

for the purpose of conforming with any legal requirement, restriction or condition in any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be
performed; or

for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any jurisdiction or the enforcement in any jurisdiction against the Issuer of either a judgment
already obtained or any of the provisions of this Trust Deed.

Subject to the provisions of this Trust Deed, the Trustee may confer on any person so appointed such functions as it thinks fit. The Trustee may by
notice in writing to the Issuer and such person remove any person so appointed. At the request of the Trustee, the Issuer will as soon as practicable
do all things at the costs of the Issuer as may be required to perfect such appointment or removal and each of them irrevocably appoints the Trustee
to be its attorney in its name and on its behalf to do so. The Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring or supervising any such co-trustee and
shall not be liable for the acts and/or omission of any such co-trustee. The obligations of each co-trustee shall be several and not joint.

17.4 Competence
of
a
Majority
of
Trustees

If there are more than two Trustees the majority of such Trustees will (provided such majority includes a trust corporation) be competent to carry out
all or any of the Trustee’s functions.

17.5

Successor

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted, any corporation with which it may be consolidated or amalgamated or any
corporation resulting from any merger, amalgamation, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, any corporation to which
the Trustee shall sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets or any corporation to which the Trustee shall sell or otherwise transfer
all or substantially all of its corporate trust business, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, be the successor to the Trustee under this Trust
Deed without the execution or delivery of any papers or any further act on the part of the parties hereto whereupon the Issuer and such successor
shall acquire and become subject to the same rights and obligations between themselves as if they had entered into a deed in the form mutatis
mutandis of this Trust Deed. Notice of any such merger, amalgamation, conversion, consolidation, sale or transfer shall be given by the Trustee to
the Issuer as soon as practicable.

If there is no facsimile number specified above for a party (and such party has not notified the other parties of any facsimile number to be used for
communications to that party) then communications to or from that party for the purposes of this Trust Deed shall be sent by registered post, courier

fax or email will be written legal evidence.

For the purposes of this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes, the Trustee will only be considered to have notice of anything if the
relevant communication is addressed to the Trustee at the address, facsimile number or email address and marked to the attention of the person or
department specified above or in any notice updating such details.

The Trustee may conclusively rely on and shall be fully authorised and protected in and shall have no liability for acting or omitting to act upon or in
reliance on written or facsimile or email communications, notices or certificates from and/or instructions or directions of the Issuer or any Agent
with respect to any matter covered in this Trust Deed and/or the Notes and/or the Agency Agreement or on any certificate, instructions, opinion,

35

received from, through or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other alternative clearing system), original or copy, delivered
or faxed or sent electronically to it and believed by it to be genuine and to have been sent by the proper person or persons, and shall not have any
responsibility or duty or obligation to verify or confirm that the person giving the same is duly authorised to give instructions, directions, notices,
certificates or other communications on behalf of the Issuer and shall not be liable for any losses, liability, costs or expenses incurred or sustained by
the Issuer or any other person as a result of such reliance upon or compliance with such instructions, directions, notices, certificates or other
communications.

All communications, documents, notices, certificates etc. provided under this Trust Deed or in relation to the Notes will be in English or
accompanied by a translation into English thereof certified as a true and accurate translation by a professionally qualified translator or by some other
person competent to do so. The Trustee may rely conclusively on any such translation and shall be entitled to assume that it is a complete and
accurate translation of the original, and the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable to the Issuer any Noteholder, the Agents or any other person for
so doing.

The Internet cannot guarantee the integrity and safety of transferred data nor the delay in which they will be processed. The Trustee shall therefore
not be liable for any operational incident and its consequences arising from the use of the Internet.

19

Currency
Indemnity

19.1 Currency
of
Account
and
Payment

Australian dollars (or, in the case of any payments pursuant to Clause 10 to the Trustee or any other indemnified party (as defined in Clause 10.5)
for its own account, U.S. dollars) (the “Contractual
Currency”) is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer
under or in connection with this Trust Deed and the Notes, including damages.

19.2 Extent
of
discharge

An amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Contractual Currency (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise), by the Trustee or any Noteholder in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will only discharge the Issuer to the extent of the Contractual Currency amount which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

19.3

Indemnity

If an amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Contractual Currency (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise), by the Trustee or any Noteholder in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer is less than the Contractual Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient under
this Trust Deed or the Notes, the Issuer will indemnify it on demand against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Issuer will
indemnify the recipient on demand against the cost of making any such purchase.

36

19.4

Indemnity
separate

The indemnities in this Clause 19 and in Clauses 4.1 and 10.5 constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Trust
Deed, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee and/or any
Noteholder and will continue in full force and effect despite any judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under this Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and/or the Notes or any other judgment or order.

20

Prescription

Claims in respect of principal, default interest and other sums payable in respect of the Notes will become prescribed unless made within ten years
(in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of default interest and other sums) from the date upon which such payments become due. None
of the Trustee or any Agent shall have any responsibility, obligation or liability with respect to any Noteholder for any amounts so prescribed.

21

Governing
Law
and
Jurisdiction

21.1 Governing
Law

This Trust Deed and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
English law.

21.2

Jurisdiction

The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this Trust Deed and the Notes and
accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Trust Deed or the Notes (“Proceedings”) may be brought in
such courts. The Issuer irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objections to Proceedings in such courts on the ground
of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is for the benefit of each of the Trustee
and the Noteholders and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking
of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).

21.3

Service
of
Process

The Issuer has irrevocably appointed Cogency Global (UK) Limited at its registered office for the time being, currently at 6 Lloyds Avenue, Unit
4CL London, EC3N 3AX, to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings in England. Such service shall be deemed
completed on delivery to such process agent (whether or not it is forwarded to and received by the Issuer). If for any reason such process agent
ceases to be able to act as such or no longer has an address in England, the Issuer irrevocably agrees forthwith to appoint a substitute process agent
and shall notify the Trustee of such appointment in writing as soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days after such process agent so
ceasing to be able to act or to have an address in England.

Nothing shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. The Trustee may refrain from taking any action in any
jurisdiction if the taking of such action in that jurisdiction would, in its opinion based upon legal advice in the relevant jurisdiction, be contrary to
any law of that jurisdiction or, to the extent applicable, of England. Furthermore, the Trustee may also refrain from taking such action if it would
otherwise render it liable to

37

any person in that jurisdiction or England or if, in its opinion based upon such legal advice, it would not have the power to do the relevant thing in
that jurisdiction by virtue of any applicable law in that jurisdiction or in England or if it is determined by any court or other competent authority in
that jurisdiction or in England that it does not have such power.

21.4 Waiver
of
Immunity

The Issuer hereby waives any right to claim sovereign or other immunity from jurisdiction or execution and any similar defence, and irrevocably
consents to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process, including, without limitation, the making, enforcement or execution against any
property whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any order or judgment made or given in connection with any Proceedings.

22

Counterparts

This Trust Deed and any Trust Deed supplemental hereto may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, all of which, taken together,
shall constitute one and the same deed and any party to this Trust Deed or any Trust Deed supplemental hereto may enter into the same by executing

The Notes in respect of which this Global Certificate is issued form part of the series designated as specified in the title (the “Notes”) of Afterpay Limited
(the “Issuer”).

The Issuer hereby certifies that HSBC Nominees (Hong Kong) Limited as nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
is, at the date hereof, entered in the register of Noteholders as the holder of Notes in the principal amount of

A$1,500,000,000
(one billion and five hundred million Australian dollars)

The Notes are constituted by a Trust Deed dated 12 March 2021 (the “Trust
Deed”) between the Issuer and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking

This Global Certificate is evidence of entitlement only.

The statements set out in the legend above are an integral part of the Note or Notes in respect of which this Global Certificate is issued and by acceptance

43

Exchange
for
Definitive
Certificates

This Global Certificate will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder of the Global Certificate and the Noteholders) for
Definitive Certificates following the occurrence of an Exchange Event. An Exchange Event shall have occurred if Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg
(or any alternative successor clearing system on behalf of which this Global Certificate may be held) is closed for business for a continuous period of 14
days or more (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so. In the
circumstances set out above, any individual Certificates issued in exchange for beneficial interests in this Global Certificate will, by not later than the
Global Exchange Date, be issued to and, subject to the provision of the instruction referred to below, delivered to such persons and registered in such name
or names, as the case may be, as the holder of this Global Certificate shall instruct the Registrar.

In such circumstances, the Issuer will cause sufficient individual Definitive Certificates to be executed and delivered to the Registrar for completion,
authentication and despatch to the relevant Noteholders. A person with an interest in the Notes in respect of which this Global Certificate is issued must
provide the Registrar with a written order containing instructions and other such information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete,
execute and deliver such individual Definitive Certificates.

The provisions of Condition 4 of the Conditions will otherwise apply, except that new certificates to be issued upon transfer of Notes will, within 21 days of
receipt by the Registrar or another Agent of the form of transfer attached to this Global Certificate, be mailed by uninsured mail at the risk of the holders
entitled to the relevant Notes to the addresses specified in the form of transfer.

“Global
Exchange
Date” means a day falling not later than 30 days after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open
for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar is located.

The Conditions are modified as follows in so far as they apply to the Notes in respect of which this Global Certificate is issued.

Notices

So long as Notes are represented by this Global Certificate and this Global Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other
clearing system (an “Alternative
Clearing
System”), notices to the holders of such Notes represented by this Global Certificate may be given by delivery
of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system for communication by it to entitled holders of a particular principal amount of such Notes (each an
“Accountholder”), in substitution for notification, as required by the Conditions and such notice will be deemed to have been given on the day after
delivery thereof.

Meetings

The holder hereof shall be treated as being two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, a meeting of
Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each A$100,000 in principal amount of Notes (but not part thereof only) represented
by this Global Certificate. The Trustee may allow to attend and speak (but not to vote) at any meeting of Noteholders any Accountholder (or the
representative of any such person) of a clearing system with an interest in the Notes represented by this Global Certificate on confirmation of entitlement
and proof of his identity.

44

Purchase
and
Cancellation

Cancellation of any Note required by the Conditions following its redemption, purchase and cancellation or the exercise of Conversion Rights will be
effected by reduction in the principal amount of the Notes in the Register and endorsement by or on behalf of the Registrar or the Transfer Agent on this
Global Certificate of the reduction in the principal amount of this Global Certificate. Such endorsement shall be conclusive evidence of such cancellation.

Trustee’s
Powers

In considering the interests of Noteholders while this Global Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (or any Alternative
Clearing System) the Trustee may, to the extent it considers it appropriate to do so, but shall not be obliged to, have regard to any information provided to it
by such clearing system or its operator or a participant in such system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its Accountholders with
entitlements to this Global Certificate (or an interest in respect thereof) and may consider such interests as if such Accountholders were the holder of this
Global Certificate.

Conversion
Rights

Subject to the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (or any Alternative Clearing System), the Conversion Rights attaching to Notes
represented by this Global Certificate may only be exercised by the presentation of one or more Conversion Notices duly completed by or on behalf of the
Accountholders with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg to whose accounts with those clearing systems such Notes are credited together with this
Global Certificate to any Conversion Agent for annotation and the principal amount of the Notes will be reduced in the Register accordingly. A Conversion
Notice may not specify Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, or the common depository who holds the Notes on their behalf, as the person to whom
Ordinary Shares are to be issued, pursuant to such Conversion Notice. The provisions of Condition 6 of the Conditions will otherwise apply.

Redemption
at
the
option
of
the
Issuer

The option of the Issuer provided for in Condition 7(b) of the Conditions shall be exercised by the Issuer giving notice to the Trustee and the Principal
Paying and Conversion Agent in writing and the Noteholders within the time limits set out in, and containing the information required by, Condition 7(b) of
the Conditions.

Redemption
for
Taxation
Reasons

The option of the Issuer provided for in Condition 7(c) of the Conditions may be exercised by the Issuer giving notice to the Trustee, the Principal Paying
and Conversion Agent and the Noteholders within the time limits set out in Condition 7(c) of the Conditions.

Noteholder
Tax
Election
Option

The option of the Noteholders to elect for their Notes not to be redeemed for taxation reasons (and instead for tax to be deducted from their payments)
provided for in Condition 7(c) of the Conditions may be exercised by Noteholders giving notice to the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or any other
Paying Agent or Conversion Agent within the time limits relating to the redemption of Notes in Condition 7(c) of the Conditions. Such notice of election
shall be obtainable from the specified office of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or any other Paying Agent or Conversion Agent and shall state
the number of Notes in respect of which the option is exercised.

45

Redemption
for
a
Relevant
Event

The option of the Noteholders provided for in Condition 7(e) of the Conditions may be exercised by the Noteholders by giving a written notice of exercise
to any Paying Agent within the time limits relating to the redemption of Notes in Condition 7(e) of the Conditions.

Endorsement
of
Redemption,
Conversion,
Purchase
and
Cancellation

Cancellation or reduction in the principal amount of any Note following its redemption, conversion or purchase will be effected by reduction in the principal
amount of the Notes in the Register. The holder of the Global Certificate shall present it for endorsement of such cancellation or reduction and such
endorsement shall be conclusive evidence thereof.

Payments

Payments of principal, default interest and premium (if any) in respect of Notes represented by this Global Certificate will be made against presentation and
endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, surrender of this Global Certificate to, or to the order of, the Registrar or the
Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the holder of this Global Certificate for such purpose. A
record of each payment will be endorsed on the appropriate schedule to this Global Certificate. Such endorsement will be conclusive evidence that such
payment has been made in respect of the Notes.

Each payment will be made to, or to the order of, the person whose name is entered in the Register at the close of business on the Clearing System Business
Day immediately prior to the date for payment, where “Clearing
System
Business
Day” means Monday to Friday inclusive except 25 December and 1
January.

Accountholders

For so long as any of the Notes are represented by this Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, each person who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as an Accountholder (in which regard
any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear and Clearstream as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including for the purposes
of any quorum requirements of, or in the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders) other than with respect to payment of principal and other
amounts due on such Notes and (without prejudice to the provisions hereof or the Conditions relating to the manner of exercise of the Conversion Right or
performance by the Issuer of its obligations with respect to the conversion) in respect of all rights relating to conversion of the Notes, the rights to which
shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the holder of this Global Certificate in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms
of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for its share of each payment made
to the holder of this Global Certificate.

Transfers

Transfers of interests in the Notes will be effected through the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (or any Alternative Clearing System) and
their respective participants in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (or any Alternative Clearing System)
and their respective direct and indirect participants.

This Global Certificate shall not be valid for any purpose until authenticated by or on behalf of the Registrar.

(i) A holder of a Note may by an instrument in writing (a “form
of
proxy”) in the form available from the specified office of any Agent in English
signed by the holder or, in the case of a corporation, executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an attorney or a duly authorised officer
of the corporation and delivered to any Paying Agent or Transfer Agent not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for any meeting, appoint any
person (a “proxy”) to act on his or its behalf in connection with any meeting or proposed meeting of Noteholders.

(ii) A holder of a Note which is a corporation may by delivering to any Paying Agent or Transfer Agent not later than 48 hours before the time fixed
for any meeting a resolution of its directors or other governing body in English authorise any person to act as its representative (a “representative”)
in connection with any meeting or proposed meeting of Noteholders.

As used in this Schedule 3, “48
hours” shall mean a period of 48 hours including all or part of a day upon which banks are open for business in both
the place where the relevant meeting is to be held in each of the places where the Paying Agents and the Transfer Agents have their specified offices
(disregarding for this purpose the day upon which such meeting is to be held) and such period shall be extended by one period or, to the extent
necessary, more periods of 48 hours until there is included as aforesaid all or part of a day upon which banks are open for business in all of the places
as aforesaid.

The Issuer or the Trustee may at any time convene a meeting. If the Trustee receives a written request by Noteholders holding at least ten per cent. in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding and is indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction against
all costs and expenses, the Trustee shall convene a meeting. Every meeting shall be held at a time and place approved by the Trustee. A meeting that
has been validly convened in accordance with this paragraph 2, may be cancelled by the person who convened such meeting by giving at least seven
days’ notice (exclusive of the day on which the notice is given or deemed to be given and of the day of the meeting) to the Noteholders (with a copy
to the Trustee where such meeting was convened by the Issuer or to the Issuer where such meeting was convened by the Trustee). Any meeting
cancelled in accordance with this paragraph 2 shall be deemed not to have been convened.

At least 21 days’ notice (exclusive of the day on which the notice is given and of the day on which the meeting is held) specifying the day, time and
place of meeting shall be given to the Noteholders. A copy of the notice shall in all cases be given by the party convening the meeting to each of the
other parties. Such notice shall also specify, unless in any particular case the Trustee otherwise agrees, the nature of the resolutions to be proposed.

A person (who may, but need not, be a Noteholder) nominated in writing by the Trustee may take the chair at every such meeting but if no such
nomination is made or if at any meeting the person nominated shall not be present within 15 minutes after the time fixed for the meeting the
Noteholders present shall choose one of their number to be chairman, failing which the Issuer may appoint a chairman. The chairman of an adjourned
meeting need not be the same person as was the chairman of the original meeting.

At any such meeting any one or more persons present in person holding Notes or being proxies or representatives and holding or representing in the
aggregate not less than ten per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding shall (except for the purpose of
passing an Extraordinary Resolution) form a quorum for the transaction of business and no business (other than the choosing of a chairman) shall be
transacted at any meeting unless the requisite quorum be present at the commencement of business. The quorum at any such meeting for passing an
Extraordinary Resolution shall (subject as provided below) be one or more persons present in person holding Notes or being proxies or
representatives and holding or representing more than 50 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding
provided that at any meeting the business of which includes any of the matters specified in the proviso to paragraph 16 the quorum shall be one or
more persons present in person holding Notes or being proxies or representatives and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than 75 per
cent. in aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding.

If within 15 minutes from the time fixed for any such meeting a quorum is not present the meeting shall, if convened upon the requisition of
Noteholders, be dissolved. In any other case it shall stand adjourned (unless the Issuer and the Trustee agree that it be dissolved) for such period, not
being less than 14 days nor more than 42 days, and to such place, as may be decided by the chairman. At such adjourned meeting two or more
persons present in person holding Notes or being proxies or representatives (whatever the principal amount of the Notes so held or represented) shall
form a quorum and may pass any resolution and decide upon all matters which could properly have been dealt with at the meeting from which the
adjournment took place had a quorum been present at such meeting provided that at any adjourned meeting at which is to be proposed an
Extraordinary Resolution for the purpose of effecting any of the modifications specified in the proviso to paragraph 16 the quorum shall be two or
more persons so present holding Notes or being proxies or representatives and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than 50 per cent. in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding.

The chairman may with the consent of (and shall if directed by) any meeting adjourn such meeting from time to time and from place to place but no
business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting from which the
adjournment took place.

At least ten days’ notice of any meeting adjourned through want of a quorum shall be given in the same manner as for an original meeting and such
notice shall state the quorum required at such adjourned meeting. It shall not, however, otherwise be necessary to give any notice of an adjourned
meeting.

Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first instance by a show of hands and in case of equality of votes the chairman shall
both on a show of hands and on a poll have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes (if any) which he may have as a Noteholder or as a proxy
or representative.

10

At any meeting, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by the chairman, the Issuer, the Trustee or
by one or more persons holding one or more Notes or being proxies or representatives and holding or representing in the aggregate not less than two
per cent. in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried
by a particular majority or lost or not carried by any particular majority shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or
proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.

If at any meeting a poll is so demanded, it shall be taken in such manner and (subject as provided below) either at once or after such an adjournment
as the chairman directs and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded as at the date
of the taking of the poll. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuation of the meeting for the transaction of any business other than the
question on which the poll has been demanded.

Any poll demanded at any meeting on the election of a chairman or on any question of adjournment shall be taken at the meeting without
adjournment.

The Issuer and the Trustee (through their respective representatives) and their respective financial and legal advisers may attend and speak at any
meeting of Noteholders. No one else may attend at any meeting of Noteholders or join with others in requesting the convening of such a meeting
unless he is the holder of a Note or is a proxy or a representative.

At any meeting on a show of hands every holder who is present in person or any person who is present and is a proxy or a representative shall have
one vote and on a poll every person who is so present shall have one vote in respect of each A$200,000 in principal amount of Notes held or in
respect of which he is a proxy or a representative. Without prejudice to the obligations of proxies, any person entitled to more than one vote need not
use all his votes or cast all the votes to which he is entitled in the same way.

A proxy need not be a Noteholder.

A meeting of Noteholders shall, subject to the Conditions, in addition to the powers given above, but without prejudice to any powers conferred on
other persons by this Trust Deed, have power exercisable by Extraordinary Resolution:

to sanction any proposal by the Issuer or the Trustee for any modification, abrogation, variation or compromise of, or arrangement in respect of, the
rights of the Noteholders against the Issuer or against any of its property whether such rights shall arise under this Trust Deed or otherwise;

to sanction any scheme or proposal for the conversion, exchange, substitution or sale of the Notes for, or the conversion or exchange of the Notes
into, or the cancellation of the Notes in consideration of, shares, stock, bonds, debentures, debenture stock and/or other obligations and/or securities
of the Issuer or any other entity (including, without limitation, any trust) formed or to be formed, or partly for or into or in consideration of such
shares, stock, bonds, debentures, debenture stock and/or other obligations and/or securities as aforesaid and partly for or into or in consideration of
cash;

An Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders duly convened and held in accordance with this Trust Deed shall be binding upon
all the Noteholders, whether or not present at such meeting and whether or not they vote in favour, and each of the Noteholders shall be bound to
give effect to it accordingly. The passing of any such resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the circumstances of such resolution justify the
passing of it.

The expression “Extraordinary
Resolution” means a resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders duly convened and held in accordance with
these provisions by a majority consisting of not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast.

Subject to the following sentence, a written resolution signed by the holders of not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes outstanding (“Written
Resolution”) may be contained in one document or in several documents in like form, each signed by or on behalf of
one or more of the Noteholders.

For so long as the Notes are in the form of a Global Certificate registered in the name of any nominee for one or more of Euroclear, Clearstream,
Luxembourg or another clearing system, then, in respect of any resolution proposed by the Issuer or the Trustee:

55

20.1 where the terms of the proposed resolution have been notified to the Noteholders through the relevant clearing system(s), the Issuer and the Trustee
shall be entitled to rely upon approval of such resolution proposed by the Issuer or the Trustee (as the case may be) given by way of electronic
consents communicated through the electronic communications systems of the relevant clearing system(s) in accordance with their operating rules
and procedures by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding (“Electronic
Consent”). None of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be liable or responsible to anyone for such reliance; and

20.2 where Electronic Consent is not being sought, for the purpose of determining whether a Written Resolution has been validly passed, each of the

Issuer and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on consent or instructions given in writing directly to the Issuer and/or the Trustee (as the case may
be) by (a) accountholders in the clearing system(s) with entitlements to such Global Certificate and/or (b) where the accountholders hold any such
entitlement on behalf of another person, on written consent from or written instruction by the person identified by that accountholder as the person
for whom such entitlement is held. For the purpose of establishing the entitlement to give any such consent or instruction, the Issuer and the Trustee
shall be entitled to rely on any certificate or other document issued by, in the case of (a) above, Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other
relevant clearing system (the “relevant
clearing
system”) and, in the case of (b) above, the relevant clearing system and the accountholder
identified by the relevant clearing system for the purpose of (b) above. Any resolution passed in such manner shall be binding on all Noteholders,
even if the relevant consent or instruction proves to be defective. Any such certificate or other document shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding for all purposes. Any such certificate or other document may comprise any form of statement or print out of electronic
records provided by the relevant clearing system (including Euroclear’s EUCLID or Clearstream, Luxembourg’s CreationOnline system) in
accordance with its usual procedures and in which the accountholder of a particular principal or nominal amount of the Notes is clearly identified
together with the amount of such holding. None of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be liable to any person by reason of having accepted as valid or not
having rejected any certificate or other document to such effect purporting to be issued by any such person and subsequently found to be forged or
not authentic; and

20.3 A Written Resolution and/or Electronic Consent shall take effect as an Extraordinary Resolution. A Written Resolution and/or Electronic Consent

will be binding on all Noteholders, whether or not they participated in such Written Resolution and/or Electronic Consent.

21

22

Minutes of all resolutions and proceedings at every such meeting shall be made and entered in the books to be from time to time provided for that
purpose by the Issuer or the Trustee and any such minutes, if purporting to be signed by the chairman of the meeting at which such resolutions were
passed or proceedings transacted or by the chairman of the next succeeding meeting of Noteholders, shall be conclusive evidence of the matters
contained in them and until the contrary is proved every such meeting in respect of the proceedings of which minutes have been so made and signed
shall be deemed to have been duly convened and held and all resolutions passed or proceedings transacted at it to have been duly passed and
transacted.

Subject to all other provisions contained in this Trust Deed, the Trustee may without the consent of the Noteholders prescribe such further
regulations regarding the holding of meetings of Noteholders and attendance and voting at them as the Trustee may in its sole discretion determine
including particularly (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) such regulations and requirements as the Trustee thinks

56

proper or appropriate so as to satisfy itself that persons who purport to requisition a meeting in accordance with paragraph 3 or who purport to make
any requisition to the Trustee in accordance with this Trust Deed are in fact Noteholders and that those who purport to attend or vote at a meeting or
to sign a written resolution or to provide an Electronic Consent are entitled to do so.

TERMS
AND
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
NOTES

The following, subject to completion and amendment, and save for the paragraphs in italics, is the text of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.

If the Notes were to be issued in definitive form, the terms and conditions set out on the reverse of each of such Notes (as the case may be) would be as
follows. While the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate (as defined in the Trust Deed), they will be governed by the same terms and conditions
except to the extent that such terms and conditions are appropriate only to securities in definitive form or are expressly varied by the terms of such Global
Certificate.

The issue of the A$1,500,000,000 Zero Coupon Convertible Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”, which expression shall, unless otherwise indicated, include any
further Notes issued pursuant to Condition 18 and consolidated and forming a single series with the Notes) was (save in respect of any such further Notes)
authorised by a resolution of the board of directors of Afterpay Limited (ABN 30 618 280 649) (the “Issuer”) passed on 24 February 2021. The Notes are
constituted by a trust deed dated on or about 12 March 2021 (as amended and/or supplemented from time to time, the “Trust
Deed”) between the Issuer and
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in its capacity as the trustee (the “Trustee”, which expression shall include any successor
trustee or trustees under the Trust Deed) as trustee for the Noteholders (as defined in Condition 3). The statements set out in these terms and conditions
(these “Conditions”) are summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed. The Noteholders are entitled to the benefit of, and are
bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed and to have notice of those provisions applicable to them which are
contained in the paying, transfer and conversion agency agreement dated on or about 12 March 2021 (as amended and/or supplemented from time to time,
the “Agency
Agreement”) relating to the Notes between the Issuer, the Trustee, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in its capacity
as principal paying and principal conversion agent (the “Principal
Paying
and
Conversion
Agent”, which expression shall include any successor as
principal paying and principal conversion agent under the Agency Agreement), as registrar (the “Registrar”, which expression shall include any successor
as registrar under the Agency Agreement) and as transfer agent (the “Transfer
Agent”, which expression shall include any successor as transfer agent
under the Agency Agreement) and any other paying agents, transfer agents and conversion agents for the time being (such persons, together with the
Principal Paying and Conversion Agent and the Transfer Agent, being referred to below as the “Paying
Agents”, the “Transfer
Agents” and the
“Conversion
Agents”, respectively, which expressions shall include their successors as Paying Agents, Conversion Agents and Transfer Agents under the
Agency Agreement) (collectively, the Registrar, the Paying Agents, the Conversion Agents, and the Transfer Agents are the “Agents”).

Copies of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement are available for inspection at all reasonable times during usual business hours (being between 9.00
a.m. and 3.00 p.m., Hong Kong time, Monday to Friday other than public holidays) at the principal office for the time being of the Trustee (being, at the
Closing Date, at Level 24, HSBC Main Building, 1 Queen’s Road Central, Hong Kong) and at the specified office of the Principal Paying and Conversion
Agent following prior written request and proof of holding and identity to the satisfaction of the Trustee or, as the case may be, the Principal Paying and
Conversion Agent.

Capitalised terms used but not defined in these Conditions shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Trust Deed unless the context otherwise
requires or unless otherwise stated.

Form,
Denomination,
Title
and
Status

(a)

Form and Denomination

The Notes are in registered form, serially numbered, in principal amounts of A$200,000 and integral multiples of A$100,000 in excess
thereof (an “Authorised
Denomination”). A note certificate (each a “Certificate”) will be issued to each Noteholder in respect of its
registered holding of Notes.

Upon issue, the Notes will be represented by a global certificate (the “Global Certificate”) registered in the name of a nominee of, and
deposited with a common depositary for, Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”). The
Conditions are modified by certain provisions contained in the Global Certificate. Except in the limited circumstances described in the
Global Certificate, owners of interests in Notes represented by the Global Certificate will not be entitled to receive definitive
Certificates in respect of their individual holdings of Notes. The Notes are not issuable in bearer form.

(b)

Title

Title to the Notes will pass by transfer and registration in the Register as described in Condition 4. The holder (as defined in Condition
3) of any Note will (except as otherwise required by law or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction) be treated as its absolute
owner for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any interest in it or its theft or
loss(or that of the related Certificate, as applicable) or anything written on it or on the Certificate representing it (other than a duly
executed transfer thereof)) and no person will be liable for so treating the holder.

(c)

Status

The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and (subject to Condition 2) unsecured obligations of the Issuer ranking pari
passu and rateably, without any preference among themselves. The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes rank equally with
all its other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, save for such obligations that may be preferred by provisions
of law that are mandatory and of general application.

2

Negative
Pledge

So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding (as defined in the Trust Deed), the Issuer will not create or permit to subsist, and will ensure that
none of its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined in Condition 3) will create or permit to subsist, any Security Interest (save for any Permitted Security
Interest) (each as defined in Condition 3), upon the whole or any part of its present or future undertaking, revenue, property or assets (including any
uncalled capital) to secure any Relevant Indebtedness or to secure any guarantee of or indemnity in respect of any Relevant Indebtedness unless in
any such case, before or at the same time as the creation of the Security Interest, any and all action necessary shall have been taken to ensure that:

(i)

(ii)

all amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes and the Trust Deed are secured equally and rateably with the Relevant
Indebtedness or such guarantee or indemnity, as the case may be; or

such other Security Interest or guarantee or indemnity or other arrangement (whether or not including the giving of a Security
Interest) is provided in respect of all amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes and the Trust Deed either:

(A)

as the Trustee shall in its absolute discretion deem not materially less beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders; or

2

(B)

as shall be approved by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Trust Deed) of the Noteholders.

where:

(a)

a Dividend in cash is announced which may, at the election of a Shareholder or Shareholders be, satisfied by the issue or

capitalisation and (ii) the difference (if positive) (determined per each Ordinary Share entitled to participate in such
DRP, taking into account the number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued pursuant to such DRP in respect of each
such Ordinary Share so entitled to participate in such DRP) between the Current Market Price of an Ordinary Share as at
the Ex-Date of the relevant Dividend (or, if later, the Dividend Determination Date) and the price per Ordinary Share at
which any such Ordinary Share may be issued pursuant to such DRP (determined on agross basis and disregarding any
withholding or deduction required to be made for or on account of tax, and disregarding any associated tax credit); or

6

(b)

(ii)

(iii)

(C)

(in any other case) the greater of:

(x)

(y)

the Fair Market Value of such cash amount as at the Ex-Date of the relevant Dividend or capitalisation; and

property or assets, in any such case as at the Ex- Date in respect of the relevant Dividend or capitalisation (or,
if later, the Dividend Determination Date);

there shall be any issue of Ordinary Shares to Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves where (other than in
circumstances subject to (a) above of this proviso (i)) such issue is or is expressed to be in lieu of a Dividend (whether or not a
Cash Dividend equivalent or amount is announced) or a Dividend in cash that is to be satisfied (other than in circumstances
subject to (a) above of this proviso (i)) by the issue or delivery of Ordinary Shares or other property or assets, the capitalisation
or Dividend in question shall be treated as a Cash Dividend of an amount equal to the Current Market Price of such Ordinary
Shares or, as the case may be, the Fair Market Value of such other property or assets as at the first date on which the Ordinary
Shares are traded ex- the relevant capitalisation or, as the case may be, ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock
Exchange (or, if later, the date on which the number of Ordinary Shares or amount of such other property or assets, as the case
may be, is determined), save that where a Dividend in cash is announced which is to be satisfied by the issue or delivery of
Ordinary Shares where the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered is to be determined at a date or during a period
following such announcement and is to be determined by reference to a publicly available formula based on the Closing Price or
volume weighted average price or any like or similar pricing benchmark of the Ordinary Shares, without factoring in any
discount to such price or benchmark, then such Dividend shall be treated as a Cash Dividend in an amount equal to the Fair
Market Value of such cash amount on such date as such cash amount is determined as aforesaid;

any issue of Ordinary Shares falling within Condition 6(b)(i) or Condition 6(b)(ii) shall be disregarded;

a purchase or redemption or buy back of share capital of the Issuer by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer shall not constitute
a Dividend unless, in the case of a purchase or redemption or buy back of Ordinary Shares by or on behalf of the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries, the weighted average price per Ordinary Share (before expenses) on any one day (a “Specified
Share
Day”) in
respect of such purchases or redemptions or buy backs (translated, if not in the Relevant Currency, into the Relevant Currency at
the Prevailing Rate on such day) exceeds by more than 5 per cent. the average of the Closing Prices of the Ordinary Shares on the
Relevant Stock Exchange (as published by or derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange) on the five Dealing Days immediately
preceding the Specified Share Day or, where an announcement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt for these purposes, any
general authority for such purchases, redemptions or buy backs approved by a general meeting of Shareholders or any notice
convening such a meeting of Shareholders) has been made of the intention to purchase, redeem or buy back Ordinary Shares at
some future date at a specified price or where a tender offer is made, on the five Dealing Days immediately preceding the date of
such announcement or the date of first public announcement of such tender offer (and regardless whether or not a price per
Ordinary Share, a minimum price per Ordinary Share or a price range or a formula

7

for the determination thereof is or is not announced at such time), as the case may be, in which case such purchase, redemption or buy
back shall be deemed to constitute a Dividend in the Relevant Currency to the extent that the aggregate price paid (before expenses) in
respect of such Ordinary Shares purchased, redeemed or bought back by the Issuer or, as the case may be, any of its Subsidiaries
(translated where appropriate into the Relevant Currency as provided above) exceeds the product of:

105 per cent. of the average of the daily Volume Weighted Average Price of an Ordinary Share determined as aforesaid; and

the number of Ordinary Shares so purchased, redeemed or bought back;

Noteholder’s account at Euroclear or Clearstream to be debited with such Notes, and contain an irrevocable authorisation to
Euroclear or Clearstream to effect such debit.

Subject to, and as provided in these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Note may be exercised, at the option of the
holder thereof, subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter provided, at any time on or after
22 April 2021 (the “Conversion
Period
Commencement
Date”), provided that the relevant Conversion Date shall not fall later
than on the date falling 10 business days prior to the Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if such Note is to be redeemed
pursuant to Condition 7(b) or Condition 7(c) prior to the Maturity Date, not later than the 10th business day before the date fixed
for redemption thereof pursuant to Condition 7(b) or Condition 7(c), unless there shall be default in making payment in respect of
such Note on such date fixed for redemption, in which event the Conversion Right may be exercised up to the date on which the
full amount of such payment becomes available for payment and notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with
Condition 17 or, if earlier, the date falling 10 business days prior to the Maturity Date (the “Conversion
Period”) provided that, in
each case, if such final date for the exercise of Conversion Rights is not a business day, then the period for exercise of Conversion
Rights by Noteholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day.

Conversion Rights in respect of a Note may not be exercised following the giving of a notice by the holder thereof pursuant to
Condition 7(e).

Conversion Rights may not be exercised following the giving of notice by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 10.

Conversion Rights may only be exercised in respect of an Authorised Denomination.

Where Conversion Rights are exercised in respect of part only of a Certificate, the old Certificate shall be cancelled and a new
Certificate evidencing such Notes and appropriate entries made in the Register for the balance thereof shall be issued in lieu thereof
without charge but upon payment by the holder of any taxes, duties and other governmental charges payable in connection
therewith and the Registrar will, within seven business days following the relevant Conversion Date in the place of the specified
office of the Registrar, deliver the Certificate evidencing such new Note to the Noteholder at the specified office of the Registrar or
(at the risk and, if mailed at the request of the Noteholder otherwise than by ordinary mail, at the expense of the Noteholder) mail
the Certificate evidencing such new Note by uninsured mail to such address as the Noteholder may request.

The Issuer will procure that Ordinary Shares to be issued or transferred and delivered on conversion will be issued or transferred
and delivered to the holder of the Notes completing the relevant Conversion Notice or its nominee. Such Ordinary Shares will be
deemed to be issued or transferred and delivered as of the relevant Conversion Date. Any Additional Ordinary Shares to be issued
or transferred and delivered pursuant to Condition 6(c) will be deemed to be issued or transferred and delivered as of the date the
relevant Retroactive Adjustment takes effect or as at the date of issue or transfer and delivery of Ordinary Shares if the adjustment
results from the issue or transfer and delivery of Ordinary Shares (each such date, the “Reference
Date”).

(ii)

Fractions:
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or transferred and delivered on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c)
and no cash payment or other adjustment will be made in lieu thereof. However, if the Conversion Right in respect of more than
one Note is exercised at any one time such that Ordinary Shares to be issued on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c) are to be
registered in the same name, the number of such Ordinary Shares to be issued or transferred and delivered in respect thereof shall
be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes being so converted and rounded down to the nearest
whole number of Ordinary Shares.

(b)

Adjustment of Conversion Price

Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as follows:

(i)

consolidation,
reclassification,
redesignation
or
subdivision: if and whenever there shall be a consolidation, reclassification,
redesignation or subdivision in relation to the Ordinary Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision by the following
fraction:

 A
B

where:

A

B

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such consolidation, reclassification, redesignation
or subdivision, as the case may be; and

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation,
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case may be.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date the consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case
may be, takes effect;

(ii)

capitalisation
of
profits
or
reserves: if and whenever the Issuer shall issue any Ordinary Shares credited as fully paid to the
Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves other than:

(1)

(2)

(3)

where any such Ordinary Shares are or are to be issued instead of the whole or part of a Dividend in cash which the
Shareholders would or could otherwise have elected to receive;

where the Shareholders may elect to receive a Dividend in cash in lieu of such Ordinary Shares; or

where any such Ordinary Shares are or are expressed to be issued in lieu of a Dividend (whether or not a Cash Dividend
or equivalent amount is announced or would otherwise be payable to Shareholders, whether at their election or otherwise),

the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue by the
following fraction:

 A
B

19

where:

A

B

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such issue; and

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately after such issue.

Such

adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such Ordinary Shares;

(iii)

Dividend: if and whenever the Issuer shall pay or make any Dividend to the Shareholders, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the following fraction:

 A - B
A

where:

A

B

is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the Effective Date; and

is the portion of the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Dividend attributable to one Ordinary Share, with such portion
being determined by dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Dividend by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled
to receive the relevant Dividend (or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of Ordinary Shares or any
depositary or other receipts or certificates representing Ordinary Shares by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of
the Issuer, by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately following such purchase, redemption or buy back, and
treating as not being in issue any Ordinary Shares, or any Ordinary Shares represented by depositary or other receipts or
certificates, purchased, redeemed or bought back).

Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date or, if later, the first date upon which the Fair Market Value of the
relevant Dividend is capable of being determined as provided herein.

“Effective
Date” means, in respect of this Condition 6(b)(iii), the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-the relevant
Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of Ordinary Shares or any
depositary or other receipts or certificates representing Ordinary Shares, the date on which such purchase, redemption or buy back
is made or in the case of a Spin-Off, the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off on the
Relevant Stock Exchange.

For the purposes of the above, Fair Market Value shall (subject as provided in paragraph (i) of the definition of “Dividend” and in
the definition of “Fair
Market
Value”) be determined as at the Effective Date.

(iv)

rights
issues
or
options
over
Ordinary
Shares: if and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or
request or pursuant to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or entity shall
issue any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, or shall issue or grant to Shareholders as a class by way of
rights, any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase or otherwise acquire Ordinary Shares or any Securities
which by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, or the right to
otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares (or shall grant any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued), in each case at a
price per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the date of the first
public announcement of the terms of the issue or grant of such Ordinary Shares, options, warrants or other rights (and
notwithstanding that the relevant issue

20

may be or be expressed to be subject to Shareholder or other approvals or consents or other contingency or event occurring or not occurring),
the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the following
fraction:

 A + B
 A + C

where:

A

B

C

is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the Effective Date;

is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued by
way of rights or for the Securities issued by way of rights and upon exercise of rights of conversion into, or exchange or
subscription for, or the right to otherwise acquire, Ordinary Shares, or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by
way of rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares to be issued on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such
Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and

is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or, as the case may be, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which
may be issued upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue of such options, warrants
or rights or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase (or other rights of acquisition)
in respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition price or rate;

provided that if at the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or ex-warrants on the Relevant
Stock Exchange (as used in this Condition 6(b)(iv), the “Specified
Date”) such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined
by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time,
then for the purposes of this Condition 6(b)(iv), “C” shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable feature
or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such conversion, exchange, subscription,
purchase or acquisition had taken place on the Specified Date.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date (or, if later, the Dealing Day following the record date or other
due date for establishment of the entitlement of Shareholders to participate in the relevant issue or grant).

by their terms carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, or rights to otherwise acquire,
Ordinary Shares), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the
Effective Date by the following fraction:

 A - B
A

where:

A

B

is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the Effective Date; and

is the Fair Market Value on the Effective Date of the portion of the rights attributable to one Ordinary Share.

issued on conversion of the Notes (which term shall for this purpose include any further Notes issued pursuant to Condition 18) or
on the exercise of any rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for or purchase of or rights to otherwise acquire,
Ordinary Shares) and other than where it is determined to constitute a Cash Dividend pursuant to paragraph (i) of the definition of

subscribe for or purchase or otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares (other than the Notes, which term shall for this purpose include
any further Notes issued pursuant to Condition 18), in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the
Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the date of the first public announcement of the terms of such issue or grant, the

of issue or grant of such options, warrants or rights (as used in this Condition 6(b)(vi), the “Specified
Date”) such number
of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the
occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, then for the purposes of this Condition 6(b)(vi), “C” shall be
determined by the application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at

Ordinary Shares which may be issued or arise from any such reclassification or redesignation, provided that if at the time
of issue of the relevant Securities or date of grant of such rights (as used in this Condition 6(b)(vii), the “Specified
Date”)
such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature
or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may be when such Securities are converted or exchanged

Condition 6(b)(vii) above, provided that if at the time of such modification (as used in this Condition 6(b)(viii), the
“Specified
Date”) such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or
other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may be when such Securities are
converted or exchanged or rights of subscription, purchase or acquisition are exercised or at such other time as may be
provided) then for the purposes of this Condition 6(b)(viii), “C” shall be determined by the application of such formula or

adjusted under Conditions 6(b)(ii), 6(b)(iii), 6(b)(iv), 6(b)(v), 6(b)(vi) or 6(b)(vii) above or 6(b)(x) below (or would fall to be so
adjusted if the relevant issue or grant was at less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the relevant
Dealing Day)) the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately before the
Effective Date by the following fraction:

A - B
A

where:

A

B

is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the Effective Date; and

is the Fair Market Value on the Effective Date of the portion of the relevant offer attributable to one Ordinary Share.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.

“Effective
Date” means, in respect of this Condition 6(b)(ix), the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights on
the Relevant Stock Exchange;

25

(x)

Change
of
Control: if a Change of Control occurs, then upon any exercise of Conversion Rights where the Conversion Date falls
during the period (the “Change
of
Control
Period”) commencing on the occurrence of the Change of Control and ending 30
calendar days following the Change of Control or, if later, 30 calendar days following the date on which a Relevant Event Notice as
required by Condition 6(g) is given, the Conversion Price (the “Change
of
Control
Conversion
Price”) shall be as determined
pursuant to the following formula:

COCCP    =   OCP/(1+ (CP x c/t))

where:

COCCP    =   means the Change of Control Conversion Price;

OCP

=

means the Conversion Price in effect on the relevant Conversion Date, disregarding the
application of this Condition 6(b)(x);

c

t

=

=

means the number of days from and including the date the Change of Control occurs to
but excluding the Maturity Date;

means the number of days from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
Maturity Date;

(xi)

other
events: if the Issuer determines that an adjustment should be made to the Conversion Price as a result of one or more
circumstances not referred to above in this Condition 6(b), the Issuer shall, at its own expense and acting reasonably, request an
Independent Adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) to the Conversion Price is fair and reasonable to
take account thereof and the date on which such adjustment (if any) should take effect and upon such determination such
adjustment (if any) shall be made and shall take effect in accordance with such determination, provided that an adjustment shall
only be made pursuant to this Condition 6(b)(xi) if such Independent Adviser is so requested to make such a determination not
more than 21 days after the date on which the relevant circumstance arises and if the adjustment would result in a reduction to the
Conversion Price.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where:

(a)

the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this Condition 6(b) have already resulted or will result in an
adjustment to the Conversion Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other
events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where more than
one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of
the Issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification
shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised by an Independent Adviser to be in its opinion
appropriate to give the intended result; and

(b)

such modification shall be made to the operation of these Conditions as may be advised by an Independent Adviser to be in its
opinion appropriate:

(i)

to ensure that an adjustment to the Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into account more
than once; and

(ii)

to ensure that the economic effect of a Dividend is not taken into account more than once.

The Issuer has undertaken that it will not take any corporate or other action which is equivalent to Conditions 6(b)(i) to 6(b)(x) (both
inclusive) that would cause the Conversion Price of the Notes to be adjusted in a manner that contravenes the Corporations Act or the ASX
Listing Rules or the listing rules of any Alternative Stock Exchange.

26

(x)

(y)

(z)

the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the
conversion or exchange of any Securities shall be deemed to be the consideration or price received or receivable for any
such Securities; and

the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the
exercise of rights of subscription attached to any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights shall be
deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) of the consideration or price received or receivable for such Securities
or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which are attributed by the Issuer to such rights of subscription
or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, the Fair
Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant
Effective Date referred to in Condition 6(b)(iv) or the relevant date of the first public announcement as referred to in
Conditions 6(b)(vi), 6(b)(vii) or 6(b)(viii), as the case may be,

plus in the case of each of (x) and (y) above of this paragraph (B), the additional minimum consideration receivable or price (if
any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached thereto or,
as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights and:

the consideration receivable or price per Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the exercise of such
rights of subscription attached to, such Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such options, warrants or
rights shall be the aggregate consideration or price referred to in (x) or (y) above (as the case may be) divided by the
number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange
or subscription price or rate;

if the consideration or price determined pursuant to (A) or (B) above (or any component thereof) shall be expressed in a currency
other than the Relevant Currency it shall be converted into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant Effective
Date (in the case of (A) above) or the relevant date of the first public announcement (in the case of (B) above);

in determining consideration or price pursuant to the above, no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees (howsoever
described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant Ordinary
Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or otherwise in connection therewith; and

the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above on the basis of the consideration or price received, receivable, paid
or payable, regardless of whether all or part thereof is received, receivable, paid or payable by or to the Issuer or another entity.

27

(c)

Retroactive Adjustments

If the Conversion Date in relation to the conversion of any Note shall be after the record date in respect of any consolidation,
reclassification or sub-division as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(i), or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of
entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in Conditions 6(b)(ii), 6(b)(iii), 6(b)(iv),
6(b)(v) or 6(b)(ix), or after the date of the first public announcement of the terms of any such issue or grant as is mentioned in Conditions
6(b)(vi) and 6(b)(vii) or of the terms of any such modification as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(viii), but before the relevant adjustment to
the Conversion Price becomes effective under Condition 6(b) (such adjustment, a “Retroactive
Adjustment”), then the Issuer shall
(conditional upon the relevant adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued or transferred and delivered to the
converting Noteholder, in accordance with the instructions contained in the Conversion Notice, such additional number of Ordinary Shares
(if any) as determined by an Independent Adviser (the “Additional
Ordinary
Shares”) as, together with the Ordinary Shares issued or
transferred and delivered on conversion of the relevant Note (together with any fraction of an Ordinary Share not so issued), is equal to the
number of Ordinary Shares which would have been required to be issued on conversion of such Note as if the relevant adjustment to the
Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date, all as determined by an
Independent Adviser.

(d)

Decision and determination of an Independent Adviser

If any doubt shall arise as to whether an adjustment is required to be made to the Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to
the Conversion Price, the date from which such adjustment shall take effect or the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall
consult an Independent Adviser and the written opinion of such Independent Adviser in respect of such adjustment to the Conversion Price
shall be conclusive and binding on all parties, save in the case of manifest error.

(e)

Employees Incentive Schemes

No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are
issued, transferred, offered or granted pursuant to any Employee Share Scheme.

“Employee
Share
Scheme” means any scheme approved by the Issuer and in compliance with the requirements of the ASX Listing Rules
(or if applicable, the Alternative Stock Exchange) pursuant to which Ordinary Shares or other securities (including performance rights or
options) are or may be issued, transferred, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit
of, employees or former employees (including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of
any such person) of the Issuer, its Subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies, or spouses or persons related to such employees or former
employees or eligible participants of such scheme or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person or any amendment
or successor plan thereto.

28

(f)

Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price

On any adjustment to the Conversion Price, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of A$0.01, shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole multiple of A$0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if
applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any
amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the
relevant time and/or, as the case may be, that the relevant rounding down had not been made.

Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 and to the
Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent in writing promptly after the determination thereof.

The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced so that on conversion of the Notes, Ordinary Shares would fall to be issued or
transferred and delivered in circumstances not permitted by applicable laws or regulations.

The Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an
adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value or any minimum level permitted by applicable laws or regulations or that
would otherwise result in the inability to issue Ordinary Shares on conversion as fully paid or result in Ordinary Shares being required to
be issued in circumstances not permitted by applicable laws or regulations.

No adjustment involving an increase in the Conversion Price will be made, except in the case of a consolidation of the Ordinary Shares as
referred to in Condition 6(b)(i) above. The Issuer may at any time and for a specified period only, following notice being given to the
Trustee and to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17, reduce the Conversion Price.

(g)

Change of Control

Within five business days after it becomes aware of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall provide the Relevant Event Notice (as defined in
Condition 7(e)) to the Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent and to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17.
Such Relevant Event Notice shall contain a statement informing Noteholders of their entitlement to exercise their Conversion Rights as
provided in these Conditions and their entitlement to require the Issuer to redeem their Notes as provided in Condition 7(e).

The Relevant Event Notice shall also specify:

(i)

(ii)

all information material to Noteholders concerning the Change of Control;

the Conversion Price immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control and the Change of Control Conversion Price
(on the basis of such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control) applicable pursuant
to Condition 6(b)(x) during the Change of Control Period;

(iii)

the Closing Price of the Ordinary Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange as at the latest practicable date prior to the
publication of such Relevant Event Notice;

(iv)

the Relevant Event Redemption Date and the last day of the Change of Control Period;

29

(v)

details of the right of the Issuer to redeem any Notes which shall not previously have been converted or redeemed pursuant to
Condition 7(e); and

(vi)

such other information relating to the Change of Control as the Trustee may require.

Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be required to take any steps to ascertain whether a Change of Control or any event which could
lead to a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and none of them will be responsible or liable to Noteholders or any other person
for any loss arising from any failure to do so.

(h)

Procedure for exercise of Conversion Rights

Conversion Rights may be exercised by a Noteholder during the Conversion Period by delivering the Certificate evidencing the relevant
Note to the specified office of any Conversion Agent, during its usual business hours, accompanied by a duly completed and signed notice
of conversion (a “Conversion
Notice”) in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from any Conversion Agent. Conversion Rights
shall be exercised subject in each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which the
specified office of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or such other Conversion Agent to whom the relevant Conversion Notice is
delivered is located. If such delivery is made after 5.00 p.m. on a business day or on a day which is not a business day, in either case in the
place of the specified office of the relevant Conversion Agent, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes of these Conditions to have
been made on the next following such business day.

Any determination as to whether any Conversion Notice has been duly completed and properly delivered shall be made by the relevant
Conversion Agent and shall, save in the case of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Conversion Agents
and the relevant Noteholder.

A Conversion Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable.

The conversion date in respect of a Note (the “Conversion
Date”) shall be the second business day (as defined in Condition 3) following
the date of the delivery of the Notes and the Conversion Notice to the relevant Conversion Agent.

A Noteholder exercising a Conversion Right:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

shall, subject to Condition 6(h)(ii) below, be responsible for paying directly to the relevant authorities any capital, stamp, issue,
registration, transfer and/or other taxes and/or duties arising on conversion and such Noteholder shall be responsible for paying all,
if any, taxes arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a Note or interest therein in connection with such
conversion; but

shall not be responsible for any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer and/or other taxes and/or duties payable in Australia (or
any province, state or territory thereof) in respect of the allotment and issue of any Ordinary Shares on such conversion or in
respect of the delivery of any Ordinary Shares on such conversion (including any Additional Ordinary Shares), which shall be paid
by the Issuer.

If the Issuer shall fail to pay any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties payable for which it is
responsible as provided in Condition 6(h)(ii), the relevant holder shall be entitled to tender and pay the same and the Issuer as a
separate and independent stipulation, covenants to reimburse and indemnify each Noteholder in respect of any payment thereof and
any penalties payable in respect thereof.

30

For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Agents or the Trustee shall be responsible for determining whether such capital, stamp, issue,
registration, transfer and/or other taxes and/or duties are payable in Australia or any other jurisdiction or, in any case, the amount thereof
and none of them shall be responsible or liable to pay any such capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer and/or other taxes and/or duties
or for any failure by the Issuer, any Noteholder or any other person to pay such capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer and/or other
taxes and/or duties.

Ordinary Shares to be issued on exercise of Conversion Rights will be issued, at the option of the Noteholder exercising its Conversion
Right as specified in the Conversion Notice, either:

(A)

(B)

(x)

(y)

in uncertificated form through the securities trading system known as the Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System operated
by ASX Settlement Pty Ltd (“CHESS”) (or any successor licensed clearance and settlement facility applicable to the Ordinary
Shares), or

in uncertificated form through the Issuer’s share registry provider, and in the case of:

paragraph (A) above of this Condition 6(h), the Ordinary Shares will be credited to the CHESS holding specified (or to a new
holding in the name of the Noteholder (or such other person specified by the Noteholder in the conversion notice) sponsored by a
CHESS sponsor specified) in the Conversion Notice; or

paragraph (B) above of this Condition 6(h), the Ordinary Shares will be credited to an account with the share registry provider in
the name of the Noteholder (or such other person specified in the Conversion Notice),

in each case by a date which is generally expected to be not later than five Sydney business days after the relevant Conversion
Date.

Statements of holdings for Ordinary Shares issued on exercise of Conversion Rights through CHESS will be dispatched by the Issuer by
mail free of charge as soon as practicable but in any event within 10 Sydney business days after the relevant Conversion Date.

On conversion:

(a)

(b)

each Noteholder concerned, for each Note held at that time by the Noteholder concerned and in respect of which a Conversion
Right is to be exercised (each a “Relevant
Note”), agrees to subscribe for the number of Ordinary Shares calculated in accordance
with these Conditions for an aggregate subscription amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares that the Noteholder is
entitled to receive on conversion of the Relevant Note in accordance with these Conditions and (y) the volume weighted average
price of Ordinary Shares in the Issuer over the five Dealing Days up to but excluding the relevant Conversion Date (the
“Subscription
Amount”);

the Issuer will redeem each Relevant Note for an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares that the Noteholder is
entitled to receive on conversion of the Relevant Note in accordance with these Conditions and (y) the volume weighted average
price of Ordinary Shares in the Issuer over the five Dealing Days up to but excluding the relevant Conversion Date (the
“Redemption
Amount”), and the Issuer will apply the whole of the Redemption Amount in respect of the redemption of each
Relevant Note by way of satisfaction of the Subscription Amount for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted; and

31

(c)

the Issuer and such Noteholder shall be deemed to agree to set-off their respective rights and obligations to the relevant
Subscription Amount and the relevant Redemption Amount in full, and each Noteholder is taken to have irrevocably directed that
any amount payable under this Condition 6(h) is to be applied as provided for in this paragraph.

On the Conversion Date, the Issuer must issue, or otherwise deliver (or procure the issue or delivery as the case may be), to each
Noteholder (or to such other person as the Holder may specify in the Conversion Notice provided that such person is a person to whom a
transfer of the Notes could be made in compliance with Condition 4) the number of Ordinary Shares for its Notes calculated in accordance
with these Conditions. Provided the Issuer is admitted to the official list of the ASX, on the date of issue of Ordinary Shares issued on
conversion of a Note, the Issuer will apply for quotation of such Ordinary Shares on the ASX. In the event that the Ordinary Shares are
admitted to listing on an Alternative Stock Exchange, the Issuer shall apply for quotation of such Ordinary Shares on the Alternative Stock
Exchange.

The lodgement of an application for quotation of the Ordinary Shares with the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the case may be,
by the Issuer will constitute a representation and warranty by the Issuer to the person to whom the Ordinary Shares in question are issued
on Conversion (“Recipient”) that:

(I)

(II)

the Ordinary Shares issued on conversion are issued solely for the purpose of satisfying the Issuer’s contractual obligations under
the terms of the Notes and not for the purpose of the person to whom those Ordinary Shares are issued, selling or transferring the
Ordinary Shares or granting, issuing or transferring an interest in, or options over, them;

subject to the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the case may be, granting quotation of the Ordinary Shares issued on
conversion of Notes, they will be freely tradable in the ordinary course on the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the case
may be;

(III)

the Ordinary Shares issued on conversion will be issued in compliance with the ASX Listing Rules and all applicable laws; and

(IV)

an offer of the Ordinary Shares issued on conversion for sale within 12 months after their issue will not require disclosure under
section 707(3) of the Corporations Act.

Without limiting its obligations under this Condition 6(h), the Issuer shall use its best endeavours, and furnish all such quotation
applications, documents, information and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order, to procure the ASX or the Alternative
Stock Exchange quotation, as the case may be, referred to in this Condition 6 on the Conversion Date (including, without limitation, any
relevant ASX or Alternative Stock Exchange forms).

(i)

Ordinary Shares

(i)

Ordinary Shares (including any Additional Ordinary Shares) issued or transferred and delivered upon conversion of the Notes will
be fully paid and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant Conversion Date
or, in the case of Additional Ordinary Shares, on the relevant Reference Date, and the relevant holder shall be entitled to all rights,
distribution or payments the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls on or after the
relevant Conversion Date, or as the case may be, the relevant Reference Date, except in any such case for any right excluded by
mandatory provisions of applicable law or as otherwise may be provided in these Conditions. Such Ordinary Shares or, as the case
may be, Additional Ordinary Shares will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant holder shall not be entitled to receive)
any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to
the relevant Conversion Date or, as the case may be, the relevant Reference Date.

32

For the avoidance of doubt, the issue of any Ordinary Shares following the exercise of a Conversion Right and the payment of any
Dividend payable on any Ordinary Shares shall be settled directly between the Issuer and the relevant Noteholder.

(j)

Purchase or Redemption of Ordinary Shares

The Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy as permitted under applicable law to
purchase or redeem or buy back its own shares (including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing
the same without the consent of the Noteholders.

(k)

No duty to Monitor

Neither the Trustee nor the Agents shall be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists which
requires or may require an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price and none of them will be responsible or liable to the Noteholders
or any other person for any loss arising from any failure to do so.

Neither the Trustee nor the Agents shall be under any duty to determine, calculate or verify the Conversion Price and/or any adjustments to
it and the Conversion Price and/or any determinations, advice or opinions made or given or to be made or given in connection with the
Conversion Price and/or any adjustments to the Conversion Price, and none of them will be responsible or liable to the Noteholders or any
other person for any loss arising from any failure to do so.

Neither the Trustee nor any of the Agents shall be under any duty or obligation to determine, calculate or verify any entitlement of any
Noteholder(s) to Ordinary Shares upon or following the exercise of any Conversion Right, and none of them will be responsible or liable to
any Noteholder(s) or any other person for any loss arising from any failure to do so.

7

Redemption
and
Purchase

(a)

Final Redemption

Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted as herein provided, the Notes will be redeemed at their principal
amount on the Maturity Date. The Notes may only be redeemed at the option of the Issuer prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with
Conditions 7(b) or 7(c).

(b)

Redemption at the Option of the Issuer

On giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days’ notice (an “Optional
Redemption
Notice”) to the Noteholders in accordance
with Condition 17 and to the Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent, the Issuer may redeem all but not some only of the
Notes on any date specified in the Optional Redemption Notice at their principal amount if, at any time prior to the date the relevant
Optional Redemption Notice is given, Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations)
and/or redemptions effected in respect of 85 per cent. or more in principal amount of the Notes originally issued (which shall for this
purpose include any further Notes issued pursuant to Condition 18 and consolidated and forming a single series with the Notes).

33

(c)

Redemption for Taxation Reasons

At any time the Issuer may, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days’ notice (a “Tax
Redemption
Notice”) to the
Noteholders, the Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent redeem (subject to the last paragraph of this Condition 7(c)) all
but not some only, of the Notes on the date (the “Tax
Redemption
Date”) specified in the Tax Redemption Notice at their principal
amount, if:

(i)

the Issuer certifies to the Trustee immediately prior to the giving of such notice that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay
additional amounts in respect of payments on the Notes pursuant to Condition 9 as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the
laws or regulations of Australia or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change
in the general application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on
or after 25 February 2021; and

(ii)

such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it,

provided that no such Tax Redemption Notice shall be given earlier than 90 calendar days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer
would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes then due.

Prior to the publication of any Tax Redemption Notice pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee:

(A)

(B)

a certificate signed by two duly authorised officers of the Issuer stating that the obligation referred to above in Condition 7(c)(i)
cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it; and

an opinion of independent legal or tax advisers of recognised international standing to the effect that such change or amendment
has occurred and that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result thereof (irrespective of
whether such amendment or change is then effective),

and the Trustee shall accept without investigation and without liability such certificate and opinion as sufficient and conclusive evidence of
the matters set out above in Conditions 7(c)(i) and 7(c)(ii), and such certificate and opinion shall be conclusive and binding on the
Noteholders.

On the Tax Redemption Date, the Issuer shall (subject to the next following paragraph of this Condition 7(c)) redeem the Notes at their
principal amount.

If the Issuer gives a Tax Redemption Notice, each Noteholder will have the right to elect that their Note(s) shall not be redeemed and that
the provisions of Condition 9 shall not apply in respect of any payment (whether of principal, default interest (if any) or otherwise) to be
made on such Note(s) which falls due after the relevant Tax Redemption Date whereupon no additional amounts shall be payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Condition 9 and payment of all amounts by the Issuer shall be made subject to the deduction or withholding of the
taxation required to be withheld or deducted by Australia or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to
tax. To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Note must complete, sign and deposit at the specified office of the Principal Paying
and Conversion Agent or any other Paying Agent or Conversion Agent a duly completed and signed notice of election, in the form for the
time being current, obtainable from the specified office of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or any other Paying Agent or
Conversion Agent together with the relevant Certificate evidencing such Notes on or before the day falling 10 calendar days prior to the
Tax Redemption Date.

(d)

Optional and Tax Redemption Notices

Any Optional Redemption Notice or Tax Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable. Any such notice shall specify:

34

(i)

(ii)

the Optional Redemption Date or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Date (which shall in each case be a business day);

the Conversion Price, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding and the Closing Price of the Ordinary Shares as
derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange, in each case as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Optional
Redemption Notice or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Notice; and

(iii)

the last day on which Conversion Rights may be exercised by Noteholders.

(e)

Redemption for a Relevant Event

Following the occurrence of a Relevant Event, each Noteholder will have the right at such Noteholder’s option, to require the Issuer to
redeem all or some only of that holder’s Notes on the Relevant Event Redemption Date (as defined below) at their principal amount. To
exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Note must complete, sign and deposit at the specified office of the Principal Paying and
Conversion Agent and any other Paying Agent a duly completed and signed notice of redemption, in the form for the time being current,
obtainable from the specified office of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or any other Paying Agent (the “Relevant
Event
Redemption
Notice”) together with the Certificate evidencing the Notes to be redeemed by not later than 60 days following a Relevant
Event, or, if later, 60 days following the date upon which the Relevant Event Notice (as defined below) is given to Noteholders by the
Issuer in accordance with Condition 17. The “Relevant
Event
Redemption
Date” shall be the 10th business day after the expiry of such
period of 60 days as referred to above in this Condition 7(e).

A Relevant Event Redemption Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable and the Issuer shall redeem the Notes the subject of Relevant
Event Redemption Notices delivered as aforesaid on the Relevant Event Redemption Date.

The Issuer shall give notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 and to the Trustee and the Principal Paying and
Conversion Agent by not later than five business days following the first day on which it becomes aware of the occurrence of a Relevant
Event (the “Relevant
Event
Notice”), which notice shall specify the procedure for exercise by holders of their rights to require redemption
of the Notes pursuant to this Condition 7(e), give brief details of the Relevant Event and, in the case of a Change of Control, provide the
additional details set out in Condition 6(g).

Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be required to take any steps to ascertain whether a Relevant Event or any event which could lead
to the occurrence of a Relevant Event has occurred or may occur and none of them shall be liable to Noteholders or any other person for
any loss arising from any failure to do so.

(f)

Purchase

Subject to the requirements (if any) of any stock exchange on which the Notes may be admitted to listing and trading at the relevant time
and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may at any time purchase some
or all of the Notes in the open market, by private contract or otherwise at any price. The Notes so purchased, while held by or on behalf of
the Issuer or any such Subsidiary, shall not entitle the holder to vote at any meetings of the Noteholders and shall not be deemed to be
outstanding for certain purposes, including without limitation for the purpose of calculating quorums at meetings of the Noteholders or for
the purposes of Condition 10, Condition 14(a) and Condition 15.

35

(g)

Cancellation

All Notes which are redeemed or in respect of which Conversion Rights are exercised will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.
Notes purchased by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may be surrendered to the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent for cancellation
or may be held, reissued or re-sold.

(h)

Multiple Notices

If more than one notice of redemption is given pursuant to this Condition 7, the first of such notices to be given shall prevail, save that a
notice of redemption given by a Noteholder pursuant to Condition 7(e) shall prevail over any other notice of redemption given pursuant to
this Condition 7, whether given before, after or at the same time as any notice of redemption under Condition 7(e).

8

Payments

(a)

Principal

Payment of principal and default interest (if any) will be made to the persons shown in the Register at the close of business on the Record

So long as the Notes are represented by the Global Certificate and the Global Certificate is held on behalf of a Relevant Clearing System
all payments in respect of Notes represented by the Global Certificate will be made to, or to the order of, the person whose name is entered

or on behalf of such Noteholder with a bank that processes payments in Australian dollars, details of which appear on the Register at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date.

The Issuer will not be required to make any such payment in respect of the Notes until six business days after the Noteholder has provided
the necessary account details for payment in accordance with this Condition 8(b).

(c)

Payments subject to fiscal laws

All payments in respect of the Notes are subject in all cases to:

(i)

(ii)

any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations applicable thereto in the place of payment, but without prejudice to Condition 9;
and

any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of

or otherwise under or in connection with, or in order to ensure compliance with FATCA. No commissions or expenses shall be charged to
the Noteholders in respect of such payments.

(d)

Delay in Payment

Noteholders will not be entitled to any interest or other payment for any delay after the due date in receiving the amount due:

36

(i)

(ii)

as a result of the due date not being a business day;

if the Noteholder is late in surrendering the relevant Note; or

(iii)

if the Noteholder does not provide the necessary account details for payment in accordance with these Conditions.

(e)

Business Days

In this Condition 8, “business
day” means a day (other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday) on which banks and foreign
exchange markets are open for business in Sydney and (where such surrender is required by these Conditions) in the place of the specified
office of the Registrar or relevant Paying Agent, to whom the relevant Certificate evidencing such Note is presented or surrendered.

(f)

Paying Agents, Transfer Agents and Conversion Agents, etc.

The initial Principal Paying and Conversion Agent, the initial Transfer Agent and the initial Registrar and their initial specified offices are
listed below. The Issuer reserves the right under the Agency Agreement at any time, subject to the requirements of this Condition 8(f) and
to any new or replacement Agent being acceptable to the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Registrar or any other Agent
and to appoint another Registrar or any additional or other Agents or another Registrar, provided that it will:

(i)

(ii)

maintain a Principal Paying and Conversion Agent and a Transfer Agent;

so long as the Notes are listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited and the rules of such exchange so require,
maintain a Paying Agent having a specified office in Singapore; and

(iii)

maintain a Registrar with a specified office outside the United Kingdom.

Notice of any change in the Registrar or any other Agents or their specified offices will promptly be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders
in accordance with Condition 17, and to the Trustee and the other Agents.

Notice of any change of any Agent or its specified office will promptly be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 17 and to the Trustee and the other Agents in writing.

In addition, in the event that the Global Certificate is exchanged for definitive Certificates, announcement of such exchange shall be made
through the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited and such announcement will include all material information with respect to
the delivery of the definitive Certificates.

(g)

Fractions

When making payments to Noteholders, if the relevant payment is not of an amount which is a whole multiple of the smallest unit of the
relevant currency in which such payment is to be made, such payment will be rounded down to the nearest unit.

37

9

Taxation

(a)

Gross Up

All payments made by on or behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be made free from any restriction or condition and be made
without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of Australia or any
political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless deduction or withholding of such Taxes is required to
be made by law or is made under or in connection with, or in order to ensure compliance with FATCA.

In the event that any such withholding or deduction is required to be made, the Issuer will make any such withholding or deduction
required (including any deduction or withholding required from any additional amount payable under this Condition 9), remit the amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant authorities and will pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of the
amounts which would otherwise have been receivable had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no such additional
amount shall be payable in respect of any Note:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder who is liable to the Taxes in respect of such Note by reason of such holder having some
connection with Australia other than the mere holding of the Note provided that such a holder shall not be regarded as being
connected with Australia for the reason that such a holder is a resident of Australia within the meaning of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936 of Australia as amended and replaced (the “Australian
Tax
Act”) where, and to the extent that, such tax is
payable by reason of Section 128B(2A) of the Australian Tax Act; or

presented, or in respect of which the Certificate representing such Note is presented, or surrendered for payment more than 30 days
after the Relevant Date except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to such additional amount on presenting or
surrendering the relevant Certificate for payment on the last day of such period of 30 days; or

on account of Taxes which are payable by reason of the holder being an Offshore Associate for the purposes of Section 128F of the
Australian Tax Act;

in respect of a payment to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder, in circumstances where such withholding or deduction would
not have been required if the holder or any person acting on such holder’s behalf had provided to the Issuer a tax file number,
Australian business number or details of an exemption from providing those numbers; or

held by or on behalf of a holder who could lawfully avoid (but has not so avoided) such deduction or withholding by complying, or
procuring that any third party complies with any statutory requirements, by complying with or requesting the Issuer to comply with
any statutory requirements or provide information concerning the nationality, residence, identity, tax identification number or
address of such holder or by making or procuring that any third party makes a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim
for exemption to any Tax authority; or

(vi)

where such withholding or deduction is made under or in connection with, or in order to ensure compliance with FATCA.

Any Ordinary Shares to be issued under or in connection with these Conditions will be issued net of any withholding or deduction made
under or in connection with, or in order to ensure compliance with FATCA, and no additional Ordinary Shares will be required to be issued
on account of any such deduction or withholding.

References in these Conditions and the Trust Deed to principal and/or default interest (if any) shall be deemed also to refer to any
additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition 9 or any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto or in
substitution therefor pursuant to Condition 9(b)(ii) and/or the Trust Deed.

38

Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be responsible for paying Taxes or other payment referred to in this Condition 9 or for determining
whether such amounts are payable or the amount thereof, and none of them shall be responsible or liable for any failure by the Issuer, any
Noteholder(s) or any third party to pay such Taxes or other payment in any jurisdiction or to provide any notice or information to the
Trustee or any Agent that would permit, enable or facilitate the payment of any principal, premium or default interest (if any) without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes or other payment imposed by or in any jurisdiction.

any authority thereof or therein having power to tax:

(i)

references in these Conditions and the Trust Deed to:

(A)

(B)

Australia shall be construed as references to Australia and/or such other jurisdictions and the Notes and the Trust Deed

that Condition 9(a) to Australia of references to that other or additional territory or authority to whose taxing jurisdiction
the Issuer has become so subject; and

(B)

the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the change,

and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept without any liability for so doing such notice and undertaking as sufficient evidence of
the matters set out above of this Condition 9(b), in which case the same shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and
shall be notified by the Issuer promptly to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17.

Undertakings

Whilst any Conversion Right remains exercisable, the Issuer will, save with the approval of an Extraordinary Resolution or with the prior written
approval of the Trustee where, in the opinion of the Trustee, it is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders to give such approval:

(a)

not issue or pay up any Securities, in either case by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, other than:

(i)

pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement involving a reduction and cancellation of Ordinary Shares and the issue to Shareholders of
an equal number of Ordinary Shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves;

41

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

in connection with a NewCo Scheme;

by the issue of fully paid Ordinary Shares or other securities to Shareholders and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer
which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive Ordinary Shares or other shares of Securities on a capitalisation of profits
or reserves;

by the issue of Ordinary Shares paid up in full (in accordance with applicable law) and issued wholly, ignoring fractional
entitlements, in lieu of the whole or part of a cash dividend;

and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive Equity Share
Capital (other than Ordinary Shares); or

(vi)

by the issue of Securities or any Equity Share Capital pursuant to any Employee Share Scheme,

unless, in any such case, the same constitutes a Dividend or otherwise gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of any exclusion from
Conditions 6(b)(i) to 6(b)(x) (both inclusive) or Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to
the Conversion Price; or

(b)

not modify the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares with respect to voting, dividends or liquidation nor issue any other class of Equity
Share Capital carrying any rights which are more favourable than the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares but so that nothing in this
Condition 11(b) shall prevent:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

any consolidation, reclassification or subdivision of the Ordinary Shares;

any modification of such rights which is not, in the opinion of an Independent Adviser, materially prejudicial to the interests of the
holders of the Notes;

any issue of Equity Share Capital where the issue of such Equity Share Capital results, or would, but for the provisions of
Condition 6(f) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments or, where comprising Ordinary Shares (or Equity Share
Capital which by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, or the
right to otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares), the fact that the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable therefor is at least
95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share at the relevant time for determination thereof pursuant to the relevant
provisions of Condition 6(b), otherwise result, in an adjustment to the Conversion Price; or

any issue of Equity Share Capital or modification of rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares, where prior thereto the Issuer shall
have instructed an Independent Adviser to determine what (if any) adjustments should be made to the Conversion Price as being
fair and reasonable to take account thereof and such Independent Adviser shall have determined either that no adjustment is
required or that an adjustment resulting in an decrease in the Conversion Price is required and, if so, the new Conversion Price as a
result thereof and the basis upon which such adjustment is to be made and, in any such case, the date on which the adjustment shall
take effect (and so that the adjustment shall be made and shall take effect accordingly);

(c)

procure that no Securities (whether issued by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or procured by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the
Issuer to be issued or issued by any other person pursuant to any arrangement with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) issued
without rights to convert into, or exchange or subscribe for, Ordinary Shares shall subsequently be granted such rights exercisable at a
consideration per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share at the close of business on
the last Dealing Day preceding the date of the first public announcement of the proposed inclusion of such rights unless the same gives rise
(or would, but for the provisions of

42

(d)

(e)

(f)

Condition 6(f) relating to roundings and minimum adjustments or the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the
Conversion Price and that at no time shall there be in issue Ordinary Shares of differing nominal values, save where such Ordinary Shares
have the same economic rights;

not make any issue, grant or distribution or take or omit to take any other action if the effect thereof would be that, on the exercise of

(i)

(ii)

by means of a purchase or redemption of share capital of the Issuer to the extent permitted by applicable law; or

where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and the Trustee has received written advice addressed to it from an Independent
Adviser, acting as an expert, that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by such reduction; or

where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and results in (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to
roundings or the carry forward of adjustments, result in) an adjustment to the Conversion Price or is otherwise taken into account
for the purposes of determining whether such an adjustment should be made,

provided that, without prejudice to the other provisions of these Conditions, the Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time
be entitled pursuant to applicable law to purchase its Ordinary Shares and any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing
Ordinary Shares without the consent of Noteholders;

if any offer is made to all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) Shareholders (or all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) Shareholders
other than the offeror and/or any associate (as defined in sections 11 and 12 of the Corporations Act)) to acquire the whole or any part of
the issued Ordinary Shares, or if any person proposes a scheme with regard to such acquisition (other than a Newco Scheme), give notice
of such offer or scheme to the Noteholders, the Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent at the same time as any notice
thereof is sent to the Shareholders (or as soon as practicable thereafter) that details concerning such offer or scheme may be obtained from
the specified offices of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent and, where such an offer or scheme has been recommended by the
board of directors of the Issuer, or where such an offer has become or been declared unconditional in all respects or such scheme has
become effective, use all reasonable endeavours to procure that the holders of any Ordinary Shares issued during the period of the offer or
scheme arising out of the exercise of the Conversion Rights by the Noteholders are able to participate in such offer or scheme, or that a like
offer or scheme is extended to those holders. In the case of a scheme, the Issuer further agrees that the record date for participation in such
scheme will be set on a date after the expiry of the Change of Control Period;

(g)

in the event of a Newco Scheme take (or shall procure that there is taken) all necessary action to ensure that immediately after completion
of the Scheme of Arrangement, Newco is substituted under the Notes and the Trust Deed as principal obligor in place of the Issuer (with
the Issuer providing a guarantee) subject to and as provided in the Trust Deed and:

(i)

such amendments are made to these Conditions and the Trust Deed as are necessary in the opinion of the Trustee to ensure that the
Notes may be converted into or exchanged for ordinary shares or units or the equivalent in Newco mutatis mutandis in accordance
with and subject to these Conditions and the Trust Deed; and

43

(ii)

the ordinary shares or units or the equivalent of Newco are:

(A)

(B)

admitted to listing on the Relevant Stock Exchange; or

admitted to listing on another regulated, regularly operating, recognised stock exchange or securities market;

(h)

(i)

(j)

use its best endeavours to ensure that the Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights will, as soon as is practicable, be
admitted to listing and to trading on the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as the case may be, and will be listed, quoted or dealt in,
as soon as is practicable, on any other stock exchange or securities market on which the Ordinary Shares may then be listed or quoted or
dealt in;

subject to Condition 9(b), not change the jurisdiction in which it is domiciled or resident or to whose taxing authority it is subject generally
unless it would not thereafter be required pursuant to then current laws and regulations to withhold or deduct for or on account of any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of such
jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or therein having power to tax in respect of any payment on or in respect of the Notes;

for so long as any Note remains outstanding and subject to the occurrence of a Change of Control, use its reasonable endeavours to ensure
that its issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares shall be admitted to listing and to trading on the ASX or the Alternative Stock Exchange, as
the case may be;

(k)

in the event the Ordinary Shares are listed on an Alternative Stock Exchange:

(i)

(ii)

confirm and agree that from the completion of the Alternative Stock Exchange listing these Conditions will be deemed to apply
mutatis mutandis as if the Conversion Right in relation to the Notes applied to the newly listed Ordinary Shares;

take (or shall procure that there is taken) all necessary action to ensure that promptly after completion of the Alternative Stock
Exchange listing, such amendments are made to these Conditions and the Trust Deed as are necessary to ensure that these
Conditions and the Trust Deed provide at least the same powers, protections, rights and benefits to the Trustee and the Noteholders
following the implementation of such Alternative Stock Exchange listing as they provided to the Trustee and the Noteholders prior
to the implementation of the Alternative Stock Exchange listing; and

(iii)

notify the Trustee in writing as soon as practicable after completion of the Alternative Stock Exchange listing and give the Trustee
a representation and undertaking that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the Alternative Stock
Exchange listing,

and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept without any liability for so doing such notice and undertaking as sufficient evidence of the
matters set out above of this Condition 11(k), in which case the same shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and shall be
notified by the Issuer promptly to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17;

(l)

comply with each of the requirements of ASIC Instrument 21/XXXX (including those with ongoing operation after the Closing Date for so
long as they are relevant) being the instrument of relief that modifies the requirements of Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act, in order to
ensure that an offer of the Ordinary Shares issued on conversion for sale within 12 months after their issue will be freely tradeable without
further disclosure; and

44

(m)

for so long as any Note remains outstanding, shall provide the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements to the Trustee in
accordance with the Trust Deed.

The Issuer has undertaken in the Trust Deed to deliver to the Trustee annually (at the same time that the annual audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer are delivered to the Trustee), and also within 14 days of any request therefor from the Trustee, a certificate of the Issuer
signed by one authorised officer of the Issuer certifying that, inter alia, there has not occurred an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as
defined in the Trust Deed) since the date of the last such certificate (or, if none, the date of the Trust Deed) or if such event has occurred providing
details of such event.

The Trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively on any such certificate and shall not be obliged to independently monitor compliance by the Issuer
with the undertakings set forth in these Conditions and, in particular but without limitation, this Condition 11 or in the Trust Deed, and shall not be
liable to any Noteholder or any other person for such reliance or for not so doing.

12

Prescription

Claims against the Issuer for payment in respect of the Notes shall be prescribed and become void unless made within 10 years (in the case of
principal) or five years (in the case of default interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date in respect of such payment and thereafter any sums
payable in respect of such Notes shall be forfeited and revert to the Issuer.

13

Replacement
of
Notes

If any Certificate evidencing a Note is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, it may be replaced at the specified office of the Registrar or any
Transfer Agent subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in
connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer, the Registrar or the relevant
Transfer Agent may require. Mutilated or defaced Certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

(a)

Meetings of Noteholders

The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests, including, without

Such a meeting may be convened by the Issuer or the Trustee and shall be convened by the Trustee if requested in writing by Noteholders
holding not less than 10 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. The quorum for any meeting
convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons holding or representing more than 50 per cent. in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons being or representing
Noteholders whatever the principal amount of the Notes so held or represented, unless the business of such meeting includes consideration
of proposals, inter alia:

(i)

to modify the maturity of the Notes (other than deferring the earliest date on which the Notes may be redeemed pursuant to
Condition 7(b)(i));

45

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

to reduce or cancel the principal amount, any premium or any default interest payable on, the Notes or to reduce the amount
payable on redemption of the Notes or modify or cancel the Conversion Rights;

to increase the Conversion Price other than in accordance with these Conditions;

to change the currency of any payment in respect of the Notes;

to change the governing law of the Notes, the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement (other than in the case of a substitution of the
Issuer (or any previous substitute or substitutes) under Condition 14(c)); or

to modify the provisions concerning the quorum required at any meeting of Noteholders or the majority required to pass an
Extraordinary Resolution,

in which case the necessary quorum will be one or more persons holding or representing not less than 75 per cent., or at any adjourned
meeting not less than 50 per cent., in aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. Any Extraordinary
Resolution duly passed shall be binding on Noteholders (whether or not they were present at the meeting at which such resolution was
passed). An Extraordinary Resolution is a resolution in respect of which not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast shall have been in
favour at a meeting of Noteholders duly convened and held in accordance with the Trust Deed.

The Trust Deed provides that:

(A)

a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
for the time being outstanding shall for all purposes be as valid and effective as an Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of
Noteholders duly convened and held. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the
same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders; or

(B)

consents given by way of electronic consent through the Relevant Clearing System(s) (in a form satisfactory to the Trustee) by or
on behalf of the holders of not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding,

shall, in any such case, be effective as an Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders duly convened and held.

No consent or approval of Noteholders shall be required in connection with any Newco Scheme modification.

(b)

Modification and Waiver

The Trustee may (but shall not be obliged to) agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to:

(i)

(ii)

any modification of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement,
any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Notes or these Conditions which in the Trustee’s opinion is of a formal,
minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of law; and

any other modification to the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement
supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Notes or these Conditions (except as mentioned in the Trust Deed), and any waiver or
authorisation of any breach or proposed breach, of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust
Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Notes or these Conditions which is, in
the opinion of the Trustee, not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

46

Any such modification, authorisation, waiver or determination shall be binding on the Noteholders and, unless the Trustee otherwise
agrees, shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders promptly in accordance with Condition 17 and to the Trustee and the Principal
Paying and Conversion Agent in writing. The Trustee’s agreement may be subject to any condition that the Trustee requires including but
not limited to obtaining, at the expense of the Issuer, an opinion of any investment bank or legal or other expert and being indemnified
and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction.

(c)

Substitution

The Trustee may (but shall not be obliged to), without the consent of the Noteholders, agree with the Issuer to the substitution in place of
the Issuer (or any previous substitute or substitutes under this Condition 14(c)) as the principal debtor under the Notes and the Trust Deed
of any Subsidiary of the Issuer subject to:

(i)

(ii)

the Notes being unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Issuer; and

the Notes continuing to be convertible or exchangeable into Ordinary Shares as provided in these Conditions mutatis mutandis as
provided in these Conditions, with such amendments as the Trustee may consider appropriate provided that in any such case:

(A)

(B)

the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution; and

certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed are complied with.

In the case of such a substitution, the Trustee may (but shall not be obliged to) agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to a change
of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders. Any such substitution shall be binding on the Noteholders and shall be notified by the Issuer
promptly to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 and to the Trustee and the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent in writing.

(d)

Entitlement of the Trustee

In connection with the exercise of its functions, rights, powers and discretions (including but not limited to those referred to in this
Condition 14) the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without limitation, shall not
have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its functions, rights, powers or discretions for individual Noteholders resulting from
their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory,
and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other
person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders.

15

Enforcement

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such steps and/or actions and/or institute such proceedings against the Issuer
as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Notes, but it shall not be bound to take any such steps, actions or proceedings
or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed or the Notes unless:

(i)

it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least
25 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; and

47

(ii)

it shall have been indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction.

No Noteholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a
reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

16

The
Trustee

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility, including relieving it from taking
any steps, action or proceedings to enforce payment or taking other actions unless first indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its
satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and any entity related (directly or indirectly) to the Issuer
without accounting for any profit and shall not in any way be liable to account to the Issuer, the Noteholders or any other person for any profit made
or share of brokerage or commission or remuneration or other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

The Trustee may rely without liability to Noteholders, the Issuer or any other person on any report, information, confirmation or certificate from or
any opinion or any advice of any accountants (including the Auditors), lawyers, financial advisers, investment bank or other expert, whether or not
obtained by or addressed to it and whether their liability in relation thereto is limited (by its terms or by any engagement letter relating thereto
entered into by the Trustee or any other person or in any other manner) by reference to a monetary cap, methodology or otherwise. The Trustee may
accept and shall be entitled to rely on any such report, information, confirmation or certificate or advice where the Issuer procures delivery of the
same pursuant to its obligation to do so under a condition hereof or any provision of the Trust Deed and such report, confirmation or certificate or
advice shall be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee and the Noteholders in the absence of manifest error.

Whenever the Trustee is required or entitled by the terms of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or these Conditions to exercise any discretion or
power, take any action, make any decision or give any direction, the Trustee is entitled, prior to exercising any such discretion or power, taking any
such action, making any such decision or giving any such direction, to seek directions from the Noteholders by way of Extraordinary Resolution and
to be indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction against all action, proceedings, claims and demands to which in its opinion it
may be or become liable, and the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or liability incurred by the Issuer, any Noteholder or any
other person as a result of any delay in it exercising such discretion or power, taking such action, making such decision or giving such direction as a
result of seeking such direction from the Noteholders or in the event that no direction is given to the Trustee by the Noteholders. None of the Trustee
or any Agent shall be liable to any Noteholder, the Issuer or any other person for any action taken by the Trustee or such Agent in accordance with
the instructions of the Noteholders. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any direction, request or resolution of Noteholders given by holders of
the requisite principal amount of Notes then outstanding or passed at a meeting of Noteholders convened and held in accordance with the Trust Deed
or otherwise passed as provided in the Trust Deed.

None of the Trustee or any of the Agents shall be responsible for the performance by the Issuer and/or any other person appointed by the Issuer in
relation to the Notes of the duties and obligations on their part expressed in respect of the same and, unless it has express written notice from the
Issuer to the contrary, the Trustee and each Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are being duly performed. Neither the Trustee nor any of
the Agents shall be under any obligation to monitor compliance with the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement or these Conditions or
to monitor or ascertain whether any Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Relevant Event has occurred and none of them shall be liable to
any Noteholder, the Issuer or any other person for not doing so.

Each Noteholder shall be solely responsible for making, and continuing to make, its own independent appraisal of, and investigation into, the financial
condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs, status and nature of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, and the Trustee shall not at any time have any
responsibility for the same and no Noteholder shall rely on the Trustee in respect thereof.

17

Notices

All notices required to be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders regarding the Notes pursuant to these Conditions will be valid if published by the
Issuer through the electronic communication system of Bloomberg. The Issuer shall also ensure that all such notices are duly published (if such
publication is required) in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the
Notes are for the time being listed and/or admitted to trading. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such notice. If
publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given by publication in an English language newspaper with general circulation in
Asia (which is expected to be the Asian Wall Street Journal) and Europe (which is expected to be the Financial Times).

So long as the Notes are represented by a Global Certificate and such Global Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream or the
Alternative Clearing System (as defined in the Global Certificate), notices to Noteholders shall be validly given by the delivery of the relevant notice
to Euroclear or Clearstream or the Alternative Clearing System for communication by them to their respective accountholders in substitution for
notification as required by the Conditions.

18

Further
Issues

The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders create and issue further notes, bonds or debentures either:

(i)

(ii)

having the same terms and conditions in all respects as the outstanding Notes (or the same terms and conditions except for the issue
date and the first date on which Conversion Rights may be exercised) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form
a single series with the outstanding Notes or

upon such terms as to interest, conversion, premium, redemption and otherwise as the Issuer may determine at the time of their
issue.

Any further Notes consolidated and forming a single series with the outstanding Notes constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental to it
shall be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed in a form acceptable to the Trustee.

19

Contracts
(Rights
of
Third
Parties)
Act
1999

Without prejudice to the rights of the Noteholders as contemplated in Condition 15, no person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition
of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (United Kingdom).

20

Governing
Law
and
Jurisdiction

(a)

Governing Law

The Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them are
governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law.

49

(b)

Jurisdiction

The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or
the Notes and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or the Notes
(“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such
courts and has waived any objection to Proceedings in such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the
Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of the Trustee and each of the
Noteholders and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the
taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently
or not).

(c)

Agent for Service of Process

The Issuer has irrevocably appointed Cogency Global (UK) Limited at its registered office for the time being, currently at 6 Lloyds
Avenue, Unit 4CL, London EC3N 3AX, as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England. If for
any reason Cogency Global (UK) Limited shall cease to be such agent for service of process, the Issuer shall forthwith appoint a new
agent for service of process in England and shall deliver to the Trustee a copy of the new agent’s acceptance of that appointment
within 14 days of Cogency Global (UK) Limited ceasing to be such agent for service of process. The Issuer agrees that failure by its
process agent to notify it of any process will not invalidate the relevant proceedings. Nothing herein or in the Trust Deed shall affect
the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Exhibit
99.1

SAN
FRANCISCO,
January
31,
2022— Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) and Afterpay Limited today announced the successful completion of the Scheme of
Arrangement under which Block has acquired all of the issued shares in Afterpay. This transaction aims to enable Block to better deliver compelling
financial products and services that expand access to more consumers and help drive incremental revenue for sellers of all sizes.

“We’re excited to welcome the Afterpay team to Block and are eager to get to work,” said Jack Dorsey, Block co-founder and CEO. “Together, we’ll
deliver even better products and services for sellers and consumers while staying true to our shared purpose of making the financial system more fair and
accessible to everyone.”

The acquisition furthers Block’s strategic priorities for its existing Square and Cash App ecosystems. Together, Square and Afterpay intend to enable sellers
of all sizes to offer ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash
App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover sellers and BNPL offers directly within the app.

Today, Square also launched its first integration with Afterpay, providing Afterpay’s BNPL functionality to sellers in the United States and Australia that
use Square Online for e-commerce. This new omnichannel commerce tool can help sellers attract new shoppers and drive incremental revenue from day
one. For more information on this announcement, read the press release here.

Afterpay co-founders and co-CEOs Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen have joined Block and will help lead Afterpay’s respective seller and consumer
businesses, as part of Block’s Square and Cash App ecosystems.

Block has also appointed Sharon Rothstein, a former Afterpay Director and Operating Partner at growth equity firm Stripes, to serve as a member of its
Board of Directors. Prior to joining Stripes, Ms. Rothstein held several senior marketing and brand management positions with leading global brands
including Sephora, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and Procter & Gamble before serving on the executive team as Global Chief Marketing Officer and Global
Chief Product Officer at Starbucks Corporation.

“I’ve long admired Block’s purpose to make the financial system more accessible and inclusive. I’m honored and excited to bring my global experiences to
the diverse expertise of this Board,” said Ms. Rothstein.

“We’re excited to welcome Sharon to our Board. Sharon’s expertise in marketing and global operations make her a great fit for Block as we move into this
next growth phase with Afterpay,” said Mr. Dorsey. “We’d also like to thank all of the members of the Afterpay Board for their contributions to the
business and the transaction.”

Block will release financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 on February 24, 2022, after the market closes.
