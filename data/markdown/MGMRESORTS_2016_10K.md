Reportable
Segments

We have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own and operate
14 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino (“MGM Macau”) and the development of an integrated casino,
hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates,
and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage
for a fee. See “Resort Operations” below, as well as “Executive Overview” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
and Note 18 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our segments.

Formation
and
Initial
Public
Offering
of
MGP

On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 57,500,000
of  its  Class  A  shares  representing  limited  liability  company  interests  (inclusive  of  the  full  exercise  by  the  underwriters  of  their  option  to  purchase  7,500,000  Class  A
shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. MGP used the proceeds from the IPO to purchase operating partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating
Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York,
Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage in exchange for Operating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership in
connection with the IPO. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”) subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours (the “tenant”)
pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “master lease”).

MGP is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and
substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the Operating Partnership. MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchange
for 26.7% of the units in the Operating Partnership. The sole general partner of the Operating Partnership is also a subsidiary of MGP. MGP has two classes of authorized
and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its
holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or

1

winding  up  of  MGP.  MGP’s  Class  A  shareholders  are  entitled  to  one  vote  per  share,  while  we,  as  the  owner  of  the  Class  B  share,  are  entitled  to  an  amount  of  votes
representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP’s) aggregate beneficial ownership of the
combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. Subsequent to our acquisition of Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa (“Bor gata”)
on August 1, 2016 and subsequent contribution of Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP, as discussed below, our ownership in the Operating Partnership, which is controlled
and consolidated by MGP, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. As a result of the Borg ata transaction, MGP’s ownership in the Operating Partnership was correspondingly
reduced from 26.7% to 23.7%. The operating partnership units held by us are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the fair value of a
Clas s A share. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee.

In  connection  with  the  formation  of  MGP,  we  borrowed  $4.0  billion  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  the  proceeds  of  which  were  used  to  repay  outstanding
obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. The bridge facilities were subsequently
assumed by the Operating Partnership pursuant to a master contribution agreement by and between MGM, MGP and the Operating Partnership (the “master contribution
agreement”). The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the IPO.

Acquisition
of
Borgata
Hotel
Casino
&
Spa

On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a
consolidated subsidiary of ours. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of Borgata and resulting consolidation of
Borgata,  which  we  previously  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.  See  Note  4  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information.
Following completion of the acquisition, MGP subsequently acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for the assumption by the landlord, a
subsidiary of MGP, of $545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of 27.4 million Operating Partnership units to our subsidiary. In connection with
the  Borgata  transaction,  we  borrowed  $545  million  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  which  were  subsequently  contributed  to  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating
Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on its revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds
from the offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. Pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, MGP, through the landlord, leased back the real property of Borgata to
the  tenant  and  as  a  result,  initial  rent  payments  to  MGP  increased  by  $100  million,  prorated  for  the  remainder  of  the  first  lease  year  after  the  Borgata  transaction.
Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.

Resort
Operations

General

Our casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We believe we own or invest in several of the finest
casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly
remodeled  hotel  rooms,  restaurants,  entertainment  and  nightlife  offerings,  as  well  as  other  new  features  and  amenities.  Most  of  our  revenue  is  cash-based,  through
customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to
fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings.

We  believe  we  operate  the  highest  quality  resorts  in  each  of  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Ensuring  our  resorts  are  the  premier  resorts  in  their  respective
markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. The quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in
winning  numerous  awards,  both  domestic  and  globally,  including  several  Four  and  Five  Diamond  designations  from  the  American  Automobile  Association  as  well  as
multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major
conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year
and Chinese New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming
customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of
customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results.

2

Al l of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of the year.
At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but
managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We lease
space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible.

Our
Operating
Resorts

We have provided certain  information  below about our resorts as of December  31, 2016. On August 1, 2016, we completed  the acquisition  of Boyd Gaming’s

Domestic
resorts.
 Over  half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  domestic  resorts  is  derived  from  non-gaming  operations,  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,
entertainment  and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers  and utilize our significant convention and meeting  facilities  to allow us to maximize
hotel occupancy an d customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts,
which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit

rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

MGM
China.
We acquired an additional 4.95% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”) on September 1, 2016, which increased our ownership
to approximately 56%. We have a controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns
and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an
important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue
and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and our future property on the Cotai Strip.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai, discussed further below. Revenues at MGM Macau are generated
primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming
concessions  and  each  of  these  concessionaires  has  granted  a  subconcession.  The  MGM  Grand  Paradise  gaming  subconcession  was  granted  by  Sociedade  de  Jogos  de
Macau,  S.A., and  expires  in  2020.  The  Macau  government  currently  prohibits  additional  concessions  and  subconcessions,  but  does  not  place  a  limit  on  the  number  of
casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations.

In October 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop MGM
Cotai on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip. The land concession contract became effective when the Macau government published the agreement in the
Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to
build and open MGM Cotai by January 2018.

Construction of MGM Cotai commenced in 2013 and it is expected to open in the second half of 2017. China State Construction Engineering Corporation serves as
the sole general contractor for the project. MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to
1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government
prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity. The total estimated project budget is $3.3 billion, excluding development
fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

Customers
and
Competition

Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we
operate  in,  neighboring  markets,  and  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  including  non-gaming  resort  destinations  such  as  Hawaii.  Our  gaming  operations  compete  to  a  lesser
extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally.

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

•
•

•
•
•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
Constructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premier  dining,
entertainment, retail and other amenities;
Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Domestic
resorts.
Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including
conventions,  trade  associations,  and  small  meetings.  We  have  a  complete  portfolio  of  resorts  which  appeal  to  the  upper  end  of  each  market  segment  and  also  cater  to
leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts
during mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the
Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in
the  Las  Vegas  area.  Our  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts  also  compete,  in  part,  with  each  other.  According  to  the  Las  Vegas  Convention  and  Visitors  Authority,  there  were
approximately 149,300 and 149,200 guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 27% of
the guestrooms in Las Vegas. Las Vegas visitor volume was 42.9 million in 2016, a 1.5% increase from the 42.3 million reported for 2015. Major competitors, including
new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of
gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location
is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. For example, in
Detroit, Michigan we compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with Native American casinos in Michigan. In Atlantic City, New Jersey we compete with
other  Atlantic  City  casinos  as  well  as  casinos  in  Pennsylvania  and  Maryland.  In  Washington,  D.C.  we  compete  with  other  Maryland  casinos  as  well  as  casinos  in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Biloxi and Tunica, Mississippi we compete with regional  riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American  casinos in
central Mississippi and with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas.

MGM
China.
 The  three  primary  customer  segments  in  the  Macau  gaming  market  are  VIP  casino  gaming  operations,  main  floor  gaming  operations  and  slot
machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who
offer VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services. Gaming promoters operate VIP gaming rooms
within the property. In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover based
commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. These clientele are acquired through our direct
marketing  efforts.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profit  contribution  from  the  main  floor
segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent
years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future. To target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and
improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots, to the main
floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.

Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or
subconcessions,  we  would  face  additional  competition  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.
Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip, with several
openings having occurred during 2016 and additional openings expected during 2017.

We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Korea, Australia, New Zealand,

Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region.

Corporate
and
other.
Much like our domestic resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience offered
to guests and the location of their resorts. Aria, which we manage and own 50% through CityCenter, appeals to the upper end of each segment in the Las Vegas market and
competes with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Grand Victoria, our other unconsolidated affiliate, mainly competes for customers
against casino resorts in the Chicago metropolitan market.

Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs as discussed further below. We advertise on radio, television, internet
and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social
media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is
personal contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also important in the convention segment. We maintain websites to inform customers about our resorts
and allow our customers  to reserve  hotel rooms, make restaurant  reservations  and purchase show tickets.  We actively  utilize  several  social media sites to promote our
brands, unique events, and special deals.

M  life  Rewards  website,  www.mlife.com,  to  see  offers,  tier  levels  and  point  and  Express  Comps  balances.  In  addition,  we  offer  a  complimentary  magazine  —  M  life
Magazine — to highlight customers’ experiences and showcase “Moments” that members can redeem through the accumulation of Express Comps.

Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make

more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.

We also utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Our major Las Vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that
include golf privileges at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas. In connection with our marketing activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to play Shadow
Creek on a complimentary basis. Marketing efforts at Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi benefit from the Fallen Oak golf course located 20 minutes north of Beau Rivage.
Additionally,  we  use  entertainment  as  a  marketing  tool.  We  often  provide  to  our  customers  free  or  discounted  tickets  or  presale  opportunities  as  well  as  occasionally
offering packages that include entertainment tickets with rooms and other amenities.

MGM
China.
In January 2017, MGM Macau launched M life Rewards with a focus on non-gaming rewards to cater to an increasing number of resort and leisure
customers expected with the opening of the MGM Cotai property. For customers who are primarily focused on gaming, the Golden Lion Club will continue to provide
benefits to a range of members from lower spending through the highest level VIP cash players. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level
ensures that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resort provides. Both programs, M life Rewards and Golden Lion Club, which was used
prior to the launch of M life Rewards, are aspirational by design and uniquely focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to
increase both visitation and spend. Information from the Golden Lion Club is used to analyze customer usage by segment and individual player profile. MGM Macau has
invested in the leading mobile, customer relationship management and call center technologies to ensure that all customers get great experiences and rewards.

In addition to the M life program, MGM Macau has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide distinctive, high-end
environments for the VIP players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the in-house VIP marketing team. MGM Macau has created a variety of incentive
programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency.

Technology

We utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. We continue to automate
our IT operations to shift costs related to operation to spend on innovation. We also are implementing leading technology solutions for all MGM major lines of businesses.
We utilize data and analytics to help us make timely and accurate business decisions. We have adopted cloud first strategy to use the cloud when possible to increase our
agility and speed to market.

We continue to enhance our eCommerce platform, which is critical to the digital platforms that support our domestic portfolio of casino resorts. Our eCommerce
platform provides our guests and business partners a premier digital experience where they have the ability to create an all-inclusive experience, from accommodations to
dining to shows with real time recommendations provided based on the guests’ shopping experience. Available through our domestic resorts’ individual websites and our
loyalty program website ( www.mlife.com ), the eCommerce platform gives guests the power to customize a complete itinerary from our full portfolio of experiences, all
in one place. In addition, this platform also provides our contact center agents in Las Vegas a unified and integrated customer service application, allowing our agents to
provide fast, efficient, and pertinent service to our guests.

Employees
and
Man
agement

We  believe  that  knowledgeable,  friendly  and  dedicated  employees  are  a  primary  success  factor  in  the  hospitality  industry.  Therefore,  we  invest  heavily  in
recruiting,  training,  motivating  and  retaining  exceptional  employees,  and  we  seek  to  hire  and  promote  the  strongest  management  team  possible.  We  have  numerous
programs, both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGM Resorts
University and various leadership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers.

Corporate
Social
Responsibility

We  seek  to  conduct  our  business  in  an  effective,  socially  responsible  way  which  we  regard  as  essential  to  maximizing  shareholder  value.  Our  corporate  social

responsibility efforts are overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors.

Diversity
and
inclusion.
 Diversity  and  inclusion  are  fundamental  to  our  Company’s  value  system,  our  people  philosophy,  our  cultural  life  and  therefore,  our
competitive  advantage  as  an  employer  and  destination  of  choice  for  our  global  customer  base.  Our  diversity  initiative  at  our  resorts  fosters  employee  engagement,
individual responsibility, team collaboration, leadership competency, high performance and innovation. Our diversity initiative has been widely recognized for many years
through numerous awards and accolades.

Philanthropy
and
community
engagement.
Our host community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employees live,
work and care for their families. Our community platform features three main programs: our Corporate Giving Program, our employee-funded MGM Resorts Foundation
and our Employee Volunteer Program. Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer service and participate in civic and non-
profit  organizations  and  issues  that  advance  the  quality  of  life  in  our  communities.  Key  investment  areas  include  hunger  relief,  diversity,  public  education,  health  and
wellness and environmental sustainability.

Environmental
sustainability.
We continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives in energy and water conservation,
recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green building. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort in Michigan were the first in
each  state  to  earn  certification  from  Green  Key,  the  largest  international  program  evaluating  sustainable  hotel  operations.  We  received  certifications  at  most  of  our
domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay have all received “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many major
travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.

In  addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  and  operational  efficiency.
CityCenter (Aria, Vdara, Veer and Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED  ® Gold certifications
from the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale
hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-Mobile Arena have all been awarded LEED ® Gold certification by the Council.

At  MGM  China,  we  incorporate  the  same  commitment  to  environmental  preservation.  Our  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  and
environmental stewardship have resulted in MGM China being included in the Hang Seng Sustainability Index on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and MGM Cotai, our
new integrated resort scheduled to open in the second half of 2017 achieving the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy
Saving (Macau) Association.

The construction of MGM Springfield will further position MGM Resorts as a leader in sustainable resort operations, and by adopting innovative technologies in

the design and operating practices of this resort, we are advancing our commitment to protecting our planet in new regions.

Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on new resorts and other developments
or  initiatives  and  repaying  long-term  debt.  We  believe  there  are  reasonable  investments  for  us  to  make  in  new  initiatives  and  at  our  current  resorts  that  will  provide
profitable returns.

We  regularly  evaluate  possible  expansion  and  acquisition  opportunities  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  Opportunities  we  evaluate  may  include  the
ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. We leverage
our management expertise and well-recognized brands through

7

strategic  partnerships  and  international  expansion  opportunities.  We  feel  that  several  of  our  brands  are  well-suited  to  new  projects  in  both  gaming  and  non-gaming
developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone o r in cooperation with one or more third parties.

MGM
Springfield

A subsidiary of ours was awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be developed on
approximately  14 acres of land in downtown Springfield. Plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately  3,000 slots and 100 table games including
poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage, with an
expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land  related  costs.  Construction  of  MGM  Springfield  is
expected to be completed in late 2018.

Intellectual
Property

Our  principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Borgata  (following  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming’s
ownership  interest  in  Borgata),  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM  Grand,  MGM  Resorts  International,  Luxor,  Excalibur,  New  York-New  York,  Circus  Circus  and  Beau
Rivage, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other
trademarks  in  connection  with  our  properties,  facilities  and  development  projects  in  the  United  States  and  in  various  other  foreign  jurisdictions.  These  trademarks  are
brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing
brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark
registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with
our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.

Employees
and
Labor
Relations

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 52,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which 6,000 and 2,000, respectively, support
the Company’s management agreements with CityCenter. In addition, we had approximately 6,000 employees at MGM Macau. We had collective bargaining agreements
with unions covering approximately 34,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2016. No collective bargaining agreements covering sizable numbers of our employees
are scheduled to expire in 2017. In 2016 and early 2017, we entered into initial collective bargaining agreements for certain employee groups at The Mirage, Bellagio,
Aria, Vdara, Monte Carlo and Gold Strike Tunica. Beau Rivage is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement with a council of unions
representing various hotel and food and beverage constituencies. Mandalay Bay is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement for two
employee groups. MGM National Harbor will begin negotiating in 2017 for initial bargaining agreements with several employee groups. As of December 31, 2016, none
of the employees of MGM Macau are part of a labor union and the resort is not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be
good.

Regulation
and
Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject to
extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located.  These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility,
financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in
disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is

incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but
are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including
regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons
with  disabilities)  ,  construction,  land  use  and  marketing  and  advertising.  We  also  deal  with  significant  amounts  of  cash  in  our  operations  and  are  subject  to  various
reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations
could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our
operating results.

8

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various
federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or
wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.

Cautionary
Statement
Concerning
Forward-Looking
Statements

This Form 10-K and our 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “will,”
“may” and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding expected market
growth in Macau, our ability to generate significant cash flow and execute on ongoing and future projects, amounts we will spend in capital expenditures and investments,
the  opening  of  strategic  resort  developments,  the  estimated  costs  and  components  associated  with  those  developments,  our  expectations  with  respect  to  future  cash
dividends  on  our  common  stock,  dividends  and  distributions  we  will  receive  from  MGM  China,  the  Operating  Partnership  or  CityCenter  and  amounts  projected  to  be
realized as deferred tax assets. The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we make.

Forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  our  current  expectations  and  assumptions  regarding  our  business,  the  economy  and  other  future  conditions.  Because
forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results
may differ  materially  from  those  contemplated  by the  forward-looking  statements.  They are  neither  statements  of historical  fact nor guarantees  or assurances  of future
performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market, and regulatory
conditions and the following:

our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity;

termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or
results of operations;
financial, operational, regulatory or other potential challenges that may arise with respect to MGP, as our sole lessor for a significant portion of our business,
may adversely impair our operations;
James J. Murren, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and William J. Hornbuckle, Elisa C. Gois, and John M. McManus, members of our
senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP;
the fact that MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must
be approved by a conflict committee comprised of independent directors of MGP;
significant competition we face with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete;
the fact that our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect
our business;
the impact on our business of economic and market conditions in the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside;

China;
the ability of the Macau government to terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM
Grand Paradise, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession, which is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2020;
our ability to build and open our development in Cotai by January 2018;
the dependence of MGM Macau upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau;

extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business;
the concentration of a majority of our major gaming resorts on the Las Vegas Strip;
the fact that we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect all such gaming receivables;

the susceptibility of leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility, and to
disease epidemics;
the fact that co-investing in properties, including our investment in CityCenter, decreases our ability to manage risk;
the fact that current and future construction or development projects will be susceptible to substantial development and construction risks;
the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase and we
may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future;
the fact that a failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business;
the risks associated with doing business outside of the United States and the impact of any potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other
similar anti-corruption laws;
risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be brought against us;
the fact that a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements;
the sensitivity of our business to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results;
the potential that failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and internal customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or
subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data;
increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and
the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, which is now a publicly traded
company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-K or our 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or
events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly
update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If we update one or
more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information,
internal  forecasts  or  other  confidential  business  information.  Therefore,  you  should  not  assume  that  we  agree  with  any  statement  or  report  issued  by  any  analyst,
irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports are not

RISK
FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things,
the risks described below.

Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

•

•

Our
substantial
indebtedness
and
significant
financial
commitments,
including
the
fixed
component
of
our
rent
payments
to
MGP,
could
adversely
affect
our
operations
and
financial
results
and
impact
our
ability
to
satisfy
our
obligations
 .  Our  substantial  indebtedness  and  significant  financial  commitments,
including the fixed component of our rent payments to MGP, could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our
obligations.  As  of  December  31,  2016,  we  had  approximately  $13.1  billion  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  outstanding,  including  $250  million  of
borrowings  outstanding  and  $1.2  billion  of  available  borrowing  capacity  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility,  and  $1.9  billion,  $2.1  billion  and  $450
million  of  debt  outstanding  under  the  MGM  China,  Operating  Partnership,  and  MGM  National  Harbor  credit  facilities,  respectively.  In  addition,  the
Operating Partnership has $1.55 billion of senior notes outstanding. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would
increase  the  cost  of  our  indebtedness  and  reduce  the  cash  flow  available  to  fund  our  other  liquidity  needs.  We  do  not  guarantee  MGM  China’s,  MGM
National Harbor’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGM Macau, MGM National Harbor
or the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such
entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:

•
•
•
•
•

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds;
making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest
significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished (and, under the master lease we are required to spend an aggregate
amount of at least 1% of actual adjusted net revenues from the properties included under the master lease on capital expenditures at those properties). Such
investment  requires  an  ongoing  supply  of  cash  and,  to  the  extent  that  we  cannot  fund  expenditures  from  cash  generated  by  operations,  funds  must  be
borrowed  or  otherwise  obtained.  Similarly,  development  projects,  including  our  development  project  in  Massachusetts,  and  acquisitions  could  require
significant  capital  commitments,  the  incurrence  of  additional  debt,  guarantees  of  third-party  debt,  or  the  incurrence  of  contingent  liabilities,  any  or  all  of
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Current
and
future
economic,
capital
and
credit
market
conditions
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
service
or
refinance
our
indebtedness
and
to
make
planned
expenditures
 .  Our  ability  to  make  payments  on,  and  to  refinance,  our  indebtedness  and  to  fund  planned  or  committed  capital  expenditures  and
investments  depends  on  our  ability  to  generate  cash  flow  in  the  future,  receive  distributions  from  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  or  subsidiaries,  including
MGM China and the  Operating  Partnership,  borrow under our senior  secured  credit  facility  or incur  new indebtedness.  If  regional  and national  economic
conditions deteriorate we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to
generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot assure
you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries,
including MGM China and the Operating Partnership,  that  future borrowings will be available  to us under our senior secured  credit  facility  in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow
additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2018, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will
depend  upon  the  economic  and  credit  market  conditions  discussed  above.  If  we  are  unable  to  refinance  our  indebtedness  on  a  timely  basis,  we  might  be
forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any of
these alternatives

12

•

•

would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the
terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

The
agreements
governing
our
senior
secured
credit
facility
and
other
senior
indebtedness
contain
restrictions
and
limitations
that
could
significantly
affect
our
ability
to
operate
our
business,
as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquidity,
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations
 . Covenants
governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;
incur additional debt;
incur liens on assets;
sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
enter into transactions with affiliates;
allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise
waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger
cross-defaults  under  other  agreements  governing  our  long-term  indebtedness.  In  addition,  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  requires  us  to  satisfy  certain
financial  covenants,  including   a  maximum  total  net  leverage  ratio,  a  maximum  first  lien  net  leverage  ratio  and  a  minimum  interest  coverage  ratio.  Any
default  under  our  senior  secured  credit  facility  or  the  indentures  governing  our  other  debt  could  adversely  affect  our  growth,  our  financial  condition,  our
results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt.

In addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and the Operating Partnership and MGM
National Harbor, LLC are each borrowers under their respective  senior secured  credit facilities,  all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective
borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions. In particular, these credit agreements require MGM China, the Operating Partnership and MGM National
Harbor,  LLC  to  satisfy  certain  financial  covenants  and  impose  certain  operating  and  financial  restrictions  on  MGM  China,  the  Operating  Partnership  and
MGM National Harbor, LLC, and each of their subsidiaries (including, with respect to MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise), respectively. These restrictions
include, among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other
businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.

We
are
required
to
pay
a
significant
portion
of
our
cash
flows
as
fixed
and
percentage
rent
under
the
master
lease,
which
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
fund
our
operations
and
growth,
service
our
indebtedness
and
limit
our
ability
to
react
to
competitive
and
economic
changes
. We are required to pay annual
rent of $650 million, which increased from $550 million as a result of the Borgata transaction on August 1, 2016 (with annual escalators of 2% in the second
through sixth years of the master lease and the possibility for additional 2% increases thereafter, as well as potential increases in percentage rent every five
years), to MGP pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease. As a result, our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, make
acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our
obligations under the master lease may:

•
•
•

•
•
•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of
our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects and other general corporate purposes;
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and
cause us to lose our rights with respect to all of the properties leased under the master lease if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or
otherwise default on the master lease, given that all of the properties we lease from MGP under the master lease are effectively cross-
collateralized as a result of the master lease being a single unitary lease.

13

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse e ffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
we
compete,
and
failure
to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
. The hotel, resort and
casino  industries  are  highly  competitive.  We  do  not  believe  that  our  competition  is  limited  to  a  particular  geographic  area,  and  hotel,  resort  and  gaming
operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by
others  in  major  destination  locations,  competition  will  increase.  Major  competitors,  including  potential  new  entrants,  may  also  expand  their  hotel  room
capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in
which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has increased the
competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere.

In  addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gaming
establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California. For example, while our Macau operations compete to
some  extent  with  casinos  located  elsewhere  in  or  near  Asia  (including  Singapore,  Korea,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Malaysia,  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  the
Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and unlicensed gaming operations), certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming
(including  Japan)  and  others  (such  as  Taiwan  and  Thailand)  may  legalize  casino  gaming  (or  online  gaming)  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  currently  MGM
Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were
to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open
additional facilities (for example, the facilities currently being developed in Cotai, Macau are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by 10% through
2018 and significantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in Macau), we would face increased competition.

Most  jurisdictions  where  casino  gaming  is  currently  permitted  place  numerical  and/or  geographical  limitations  on  the  issuance  of  new  gaming  licenses.
Although  a  number  of  jurisdictions  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  countries  are  considering  legalizing  or  expanding  casino  gaming,  in  some  cases  new
gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which
may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have also legalized forms
of  online  gaming  and  other  jurisdictions,  including  Illinois,  have  legalized  video  gaming  terminals.  The  expansion  of  online  gaming  and  other  types  of
gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts.

In addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate.
Our  failure  to  compete  successfully  in  our  various  markets  and  to  continue  to  attract  customers  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
results
of
operations
. Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which
we  operate.  These  laws,  regulations  and  ordinances  vary  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction,  but  generally  concern  the  responsibility,  financial  stability  and
character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming
regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in
that  jurisdiction.  In  addition,  unsuitable  activity  on  our  part  or  on  the  part  of  our  domestic  or  foreign  unconsolidated  affiliates  or  subsidiaries  in  any
jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction
may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to various gaming
taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local and foreign legislatures and officials. Increases in gaming taxation
could  also  adversely  affect  our  results.  For  a  summary  of  gaming  and  other  regulations  that  affect  our  business,  see  “Regulation  and  Licensing”  and
Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Further, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities.
If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor
may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in

14

the property. State regulatory a gencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to
ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions also requir e the approval of certain
regulatory authorities.

In Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on the
interpretation  of  these  laws  and  regulations.  These  laws  and  regulations  are  complex,  and  a  court  or  administrative  or  regulatory  body  may  in  the  future
render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have a
material  adverse  effect  on  its  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  MGM  China’s  activities  in  Macau  are  subject  to
administrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM China will be able to obtain all necessary approvals,
and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to
administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These
laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees,
currency  transactions,  taxation,  zoning  and  building  codes,  and  marketing  and  advertising.  For  instance,  we  are  subject  to  certain  federal,  state  and  local
environmental  laws,  regulations  and  ordinances,  including  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Resource  Conservation  Recovery  Act,  the
Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and  Liability  Act  and  the  Oil  Pollution  Act  of  1990.  Under  various  federal,  state  and  local
environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or
toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of
such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be
enacted.  For  example,  Illinois  has  enacted  a  ban  on  smoking  in  nearly  all  public  places,  including  bars,  restaurants,  work  places,  schools  and  casinos.
Similarly,  in  October  2014,  casinos  in  Macau,  including  MGM  China,  implemented  a  smoking  ban  which  prohibits  smoking  on  all  mass  market  gaming
floors and, in 2015, the Macau Health Bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing a full smoking ban in casinos, including in
VIP rooms. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban
would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money
laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly
known as the “Bank Secrecy Act"”, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions in
excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  the  currency  transaction.  We  are  also
required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal
activity  or  are  intended  to  evade  federal  regulations  or  avoid  reporting  requirements  or  have  no  business  or  lawful  purpose.  In  addition,  under  the  Bank
Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy
Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws
and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties
could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
markets
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside
. Our
business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and  business
development.  Economic  contraction,  economic  uncertainty  or  the  perception  by  our  customers  of  weak  or  weakening  economic  conditions  may  cause  a
decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionary
consumer  spending  or  consumer  preferences  could  be  driven  by  factors  such  as  the  increased  cost  of  travel,  an  unstable  job  market,  perceived  or  actual
disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. Consumer preferences also evolve over
time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming
offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may
negatively impact our results of operations. Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East,
and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any
other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts,

15

w hich  would  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  For  example,  the  prior  recession  and  downturn  in  consumer  and  corporate  spending  had  a  negative
impact on our results of operations.

In addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau from mainland China, general economic and market conditions in
China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion
or movements, including market impacts  resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption  campaign and related tightening  of liquidity provided by non-bank
lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of
patacas imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China to MGM Macau and/or the amounts they are willing to spend
in the casino. For example, from 2008 through 2010, China readjusted its visa policy toward Macau and limited the number of visits that some mainland
Chinese citizens may make to Macau in a given time period. In addition, effective October 2013, China banned “zero‑fare” tour groups involving no or low
up-front  payments  and  compulsory  shopping,  which  were  popular  among  visitors  to  Macau  from  mainland  China,  and  in  December  2014  the  Chinese
government  tightened  the  enforcement  of  visa  transit  rules  for  those  seeking  to  enter  Macau  at  the  Gongbei  border  (including  requirements  to  present  an
airplane ticket to a destination country, a visa issued by such destination country and a valid Chinese passport). It is unclear whether these and other measures
will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that
may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the
gaming industry in Macau.

Furthermore, our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources. Our success in Macau will be impacted by our ability to
retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will
grow  in  light  of  new  developments  in  Macau.  While  we  seek  employees  from  other  countries  to  adequately  staff  our  resorts,  certain  Macau  government
policies  limit  our  ability  to  import  labor  in  certain  job  classifications  (for  instance,  the  Macau  government  requires  that  we  only  hire  Macau  residents  as
dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase. In addition,
limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the Macau government could impact our current expectation on the number of table games we will
be  able  to  utilize  at  our  Cotai  project.  Such  limitations  or  reduction  in  table  game  availability  may  impact  MGM  China’s  results  of  operations.  Finally,
because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed in the future, existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded
to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of
gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our development in Cotai, Macau,
could be negatively impacted.

We
may
not

able
to
sustain
continued
improvements
as
a
result
of
our
Profit
Growth
Plan.
In 2015, we commenced an initiative for sustained growth and
margin enhancement, focused on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. While
we believe these initiatives will continue to result in Adjusted EBITDA benefit, our optimization efforts may fail to achieve expected results or we may not
be able to sustain our historic efforts to produce continuous improvements. In addition, while we expect to continue to explore additional opportunities to
drive further improvement to our business processes, we may not be able to achieve the historic Adjusted EBITDA benefits at the same rate (or at all) and we
may not be able to institutionalize the continuous improvement business practices that developed in connection with implementing the Profit Growth Plan.

Our
ability
to
pay
ongoing
regular
dividends
to
our
stockholders
is
subject
to
the
discretion
of
our
board
of

and
may
be

company
structure,
existing
and
future
debt
agreements
entered
into
by
us
or
our
subsidiaries
and
state
law
requirements
.
We intend to pay ongoing regular
quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or
discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because
we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from
operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. We expect our subsidiaries will continue to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain
quarterly dividend payments on our common stock, however, their ability to generate funds will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and
financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial
ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may
have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of
their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. Any
change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

A
significant
number
of
our
domestic
gaming
facilities
are
leased
and
could
experience
risks
associated
with
leased
property,
including
risks
relating
to
lease
termination,
lease
extensions,
charges
and
our
relationship
with
the
lessor,
which
could
h
ave
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business,
financial
position
or
results
of
operations.
 We lease ten of our destination resorts and The Park from a subsidiary of MGP pursuant to the master lease. The master lease has a
term of ten years with up to four additional five year extensions, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The master lease is commonly known as a triple-
net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintena nce, (2) all insurance required in
connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other
than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expen ditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties
and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying for these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits re
ceived in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to MGP as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of our leased facilities should prove to
be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations or if we sho uld otherwise decide to exit a particular property, we would
remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the master lease even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able
to transfer  the rights  with respect  t  o a particular  property  in accordance  with the requirements  of the master  lease.  Our ability  to transfer  our obligations
under the master lease to a third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particular location,  is limited to non-Las
Vegas properties  and no more  than two Las  Vegas gaming  properties  and is subject  to identifying  a  willing  third-party  who meets  the requirements  for a
transferee set forth in the master lease. We may be unable to find an appropriate  transferee willing   to assume the obligations under the master lease with
respect  to  any  such  property.  In  addition,  we  could  incur  special  charges  relating  to  the  closing  of  such  facilities  including  sublease  termination  costs,
impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and  results  of  operations.  Furthermore,  our  obligation  to  pay  rent  as  well  as  the  other  costs  described  above  is  absolute  in  vir  tually  all  circumstances,
regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain
events of casualty and condemnation.

Any
financial,
operational,
regulatory
or
other
potential
challenges
that
may
arise
with
respect
to
MGP,
as
our
sole
lessor
for
a
significant
portion
of
our
business,
may
adversely
impair
our
operations
. We lease a substantial number of the properties that we operate and manage, which represent a significant
portion of our operations, from MGP under the master lease. If MGP has financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be no assurance that
MGP will be able to comply with its obligations under the master lease or its other agreements with us. Failure on the part of MGP to fulfill its commitments
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

and
William

may
have
actual

potential
conflicts

because
of
their
positions
at
MGP
. James J. Murren serves as our Chairman and as the
Chairman  of  MGP. In  addition,  Daniel  J. Taylor,  one of  our directors,  is also  a director  of MGP and William  J. Hornbuckle,  Elisa  C. Gois, and  John M.
McManus,  members  of  our  senior  management,  are  also  directors  of  MGP.  While  we  have  procedures  in  place  to  address  such  situations  and  the
organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the
fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP's
management  and  directors  pursue  the  same  corporate  opportunities,  such  as  potential  acquisition  targets,  or  face  decisions  that  could  have  different
implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and MGP (or its
subsidiaries)  regarding  the  terms  of  the  agreements  governing  the  separation  and  the  relationship,  between  us  and  MGP,  such  as  under  the  master  lease.
Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.

Despite
our
ability
to
exercise
control
over
the
affairs
of
MGP
as
a
result
of
our
ownership
of
the
single
outstanding
Class
B
share
of
MGP,
MGP
has
adopted
a
policy
under
which
certain
transactions
with
us,
including
transactions
involving
consideration
in
excess
of
$25
million,
must
be
approved
by
a
conflicts
committee
comprised
of
independent
directors
of
MGP,
which
could
affect
our
ability
to
execute
our
operational
and
strategic
objectives.

We own
the single outstanding Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or
losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP and which represents a majority of the voting
power  of  MGP’s  shares  so  long  as  the  holder  of  the  Class  B  share  and  its  controlled  affiliates’  (excluding  MGP)  aggregate  beneficial  ownership  of  the
combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control
over MGP’s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval.

MGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than
MGP and its subsidiaries ), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’s board of
directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) app roved by a majority of a conflicts
committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with
the NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchan ge Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional
independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by MGP’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by
the affirmative vo te of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and
our affiliates). Furthermore, that MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually o r in the aggregate, over $25 million
between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any such
transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements entered
into on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such
transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting
shares owned by us and our affiliates).

As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to us
may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts
committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain
such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

We
have
agreed
not
to
have
any
interest
or
involvement
in
gaming
businesses
in
China,
Macau,
Hong
Kong
and
Taiwan,
other
than
through
MGM
China
. In
connection with the initial public offering of MGM China, the holding company that indirectly owns and operates MGM Macau, we entered into a Deed of
Non-Compete  Undertakings  with  MGM  China  and  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Ho”)  pursuant  to  which  we  are  restricted  from  having  any
interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. While
gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until
the earliest of (i) March 31, 2020, (ii) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or (iii) the
date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.

The
Macau
government
can
terminate
MGM
Grand
Paradise’s
subconcession
under
certain
circumstances
without
compensating
MGM
Grand
Paradise
,
exercise
its
redemption
right
with
respect
to
the
subconcession
in
2017
or
refuse
to
grant
MGM
Grand
Paradise
an
extension
of
the
subconcession
in
2020
,
any
of
which
would
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business
, financial
condition
, results
of
operations
and
cash
flows
. The Macau government has
the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or
MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance
with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all of
MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  area  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  would  be  transferred  automatically  to  the  Macau  government  without
compensation  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  and  we  would  cease  to  generate  any  revenues  from  these  operations.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  Grand
Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.

Furthermore,  under  the  subconcession  contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  obligated  to  comply  with  any  laws  and  regulations  that  the  Macau  government
might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws
and  regulations  would  not  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  construct  or  operate  our  Macau  businesses.  If  any  disagreement  arises  between  MGM  Grand
Paradise and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract,
MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGM
Grand  Paradise  will  be  obligated  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  subconcession  contract  as  interpreted  by  the  Macau  government.  Currently,  there  is  no
precedent  concerning  how  the  Macau  government  will  treat  the  termination  of  a  concession  or  subconcession  upon  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the
circumstances  mentioned  above.  The  loss  of  the  subconcession  would  require  us  to  cease  conducting  gaming  operations  in  Macau,  which  would  have  a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

18

In addition, the subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino
premises  is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  the  Macau
government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017,
the Macau g overnment may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises
this  redemption  right,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  entitled  to  fair  compensation  or  indemnity.  The  amount  of  such  compen  sation  or  indemnity  will  be
determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities,
during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, dep reciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before
expiration  of  the  subconcession.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  able  to  renew  or  extend  the  subconcession  contract  on  terms
favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise
will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.

We
are
required
to
build
and
open
our
development
in
Cotai,
Macau
by
January
2018.
If
we
are
unable
to
meet
this
deadline,
and
the
deadline
for
the
development
is
not
extended,
we
may
lose
the
land
concession,
which
would
prohibit
us
from
operating
any
facilities
developed
under
such
land
concession
.
The land concession for the approximately 18 acre site on Cotai, Macau was officially gazetted on January 9, 2013. If we are unable to build and open our
proposed  resort  and  casino  by  January  2018,  and  the  deadline  is  not  extended,  the  Macau  government  has  the  right  to  unilaterally  terminate  the  land
concession contract. Although MGM Cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017, there can be no assurances that the opening will occur within the
anticipated timeframe. A loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
 .  Gaming  promoters,  who  promote
gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau. With the rise
in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated by licensed
gaming  promoters,  the  competition  for  relationships  with  gaming  promoters  has  increased.  While  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  undertaking  initiatives  to
strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships with gaming promoters. In
addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional VIP rooms in Macau,
including VIP rooms at MGM Macau. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters, or if gaming promoters
are  unable  to  develop  or  maintain  relationships  with  our  high-end  customers  (or  if,  as  a  result  of  recent  market  conditions  in  Macau,  gaming  promoters
encounter  difficulties  attracting  patrons  to  come  to  Macau  or  experience  decreased  liquidity  limiting  their  ability  to  grant  credit  to  patrons),  MGM  Grand
Paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau are closed there can be no assurance that
MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all.

In addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with
gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters
with  whom  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  or  becomes  associated  will  meet  the  high  standards  insisted  upon.  If  a  gaming  promoter  falls  below  MGM  Grand
Paradise’s  standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  with  authority  over  our
operations.

We  also  grant  credit  lines  to  certain  gaming  promoters  and  any  adverse  change  in  the  financial  performance  of  those  gaming  promoters  may  impact  the
recoverability of these loans.

The
future
recognition
of
our
foreign
tax
credit
deferred
tax
asset
is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
such
deferred
tax
asset
may
change
materially
in
future
periods.
We currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards
that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability
and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all
available  evidence,  including  assumptions  about  operating  profits  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad.  As  a  result,  significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the
possible  need  for  a  deferred  tax  asset  valuation  allowance  and  changes  to  our  assumptions  may  have  a  material  impact  on  the  amount  of  the  valuation
allowance. For example, a change to our forecasts of future profitability of and distributions from MGM China or a change in our assumptions concerning
future U.S. operating profits could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in
such period. In addition, a renewal in a future period of the exemption from Macau’s 12% complementary tax on gaming profits could have a material impact
on the provision for income taxes in such period.

Finally, changes in U.S. tax law under consideration as part of broader corporate tax reform, namely a change from a worldwide to a territo rial tax system,
could eliminate our ability to utilize some portion or all of our foreign tax credits in future periods and such change could result in a material change in the
valuation allowance, or elimination of the foreign tax credit deferred tax ass et in its entirety, with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes
in the period of such change.

Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
of
operations
.
Certain of our casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes in the United
States  and  severe  typhoons  in  Macau.  Such  extreme  weather  conditions  may  interrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  properties,  and  reduce  the  number  of
customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage. A
severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.  Although  we  maintain  both  property  and  business  interruption  insurance  coverage  for  certain  extreme  weather  conditions,  such  coverage  is
subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that
we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme
weather  conditions  may  interrupt  or  impede  access  to  our  affected  properties  and  may  cause  visits  to  our  affected  properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite
period, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Because
a
majority
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
that
is
more
geographically
diversified
. Given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected by
risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to
and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic
for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of
visitors  to  our  resorts.  Additionally,  there  is  one  principal  interstate  highway  between  Las  Vegas  and  Southern  California,  where  a  large  number  of  our
customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
. We conduct a portion of our gaming activities on
a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and
high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of
gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a
particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant,
in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can
extend credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of
operations.

While  gaming  debts  evidenced  by  markers  and  judgments  on  gaming  debts  are  enforceable  under  the  current  laws  of  Nevada,  and  Nevada  judgments  on
gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement
of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign
debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM Macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent
MGM Macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM Macau may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to
collect  all  of  its  gaming  receivables  because,  among  other  reasons,  courts  of  many  jurisdictions  do  not  enforce  gaming  debts  and  MGM  Macau  may
encounter  forums  that  will  refuse  to  enforce  such  debts.  Moreover,  under  applicable  law,  MGM  Macau  remains  obligated  to  pay  taxes  on  uncollectible
winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our
operating results.

We
may
incur
impairments
to
goodwill,
indefinite-lived
intangible
assets,
or
long-lived
assets
which
could
negatively
affect
our
future
profits
. We review our
goodwill,  intangible  assets  and  long-lived  assets  on  an  annual  basis  and  during  interim  r  eporting  periods  in  accordance  with  the  authoritative  guidance.
Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-
downs and impairment charges in t he past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be
required  in  future  periods.  For  instance,  in  2015,  we  recorded  a  non-cash  impairment  charge  of  $1.5  billion  to  reduce  the  historical  carryi  ng  value  of
goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. If we are required to record additional impairment  charges or write-downs, this could have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Leisure
and
business
travel
, especially
travel
by
air
, are
particularly
susceptible
to
global
geopolitical
events
, such
as
terrorist
attacks
or
acts
of
war
or
hostility
. We  are  dependent  on the  willingness  of  our customers  to travel  by air.  Since most  of our  customers  travel  by air  to our  Las Vegas  and Macau
properties, any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types
of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
. In addition to acquiring or developing hotels
and resorts or acquiring  companies that complement  our business directly,  we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a co-
investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property. Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject to inherent risk due
to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks
such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business
interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary
to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, we
may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors. Alternatively, our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our
consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and its
ability to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future funding
requirements,  as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’s indebtedness
subject  CityCenter  and  its  subsidiaries  to  significant  financial  and  other  restrictive  covenants,  including  restrictions  on  its  ability  to  incur  additional
indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  into  transactions  with
affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of  its  assets.  The  CityCenter  third  amended  and  restated  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require  CityCenter  to  maintain  a
maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s third amended and restated credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will
be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

Any
of
our
future
construction,
development
or
expansion
projects
will
be
subject
to
significant
development
and
construction
risks,
which
could
have
a
material
adverse
impact
on
related
project
timetables,
costs
and
our
ability
to
complete
the
projects
.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including:

•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
changes to plans and specifications;
engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;
delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,
residential, real estate development or construction projects;
labor disputes or work stoppages;
availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;

21

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
personal injuries to workers and other persons;
environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
weather interferences or delays;
fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion
or  opening  or  otherwise  affect  the  design  and  features  of  any  future  projects  which  we  might  undertake.  For  instance,  we  currently  expect  the  total
development  costs  of  our  Cotai  project  to  be  approximately  $3.3  billion,  excluding  development  fees  eliminated  in  consolidation,  capitalized  interest  and
land-related  costs,  and  we  currently  expect  total  development  costs  of  our  Massachusetts  project  to  be  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized
interest and land-related costs. While we believe that the overall budgets for these developments are reasonable, these development costs are estimates and
the actual development costs may be higher than expected. We cannot guarantee that our construction costs or total project costs for future projects, including
our  developments  in  Cotai  and  Massachusetts,  will  not  increase  beyond  amounts  initially  budgeted  or  that  the  expected  design  and  features  of  current  or
future projects will not change. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by
a  certain  specified  time  and  to  the  extent  we  are  unable  to  meet  those  deadlines,  and  any  such  deadlines  are  not  extended,  we  may  lose  our  regulatory
approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

Our
insurance
coverage
may
not
be
adequate
to
cover
all
possible
losses
that
our
properties
could
suffer.
In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
may
increase
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
. Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties,
which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our
property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total
loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as
labor strikes; nuclear events; acts of war; loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism; loss of electrical
power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise; deterioration or corrosion; insect or animal damage; and pollution, may not be covered at all
under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by
third  parties  that  may  be  injured  or  harmed.  While  we  carry  business  interruption  insurance  and  general  liability  insurance,  this  insurance  may  not  be
adequate to cover all losses in any such event.

We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to
further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any
failure
to
protect
our
trademarks
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
value
of
our
brand
names
and
adversely
affect
our
business
. The development of
intellectual  property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual  property to be an important element of our success. While our
business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to
establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the
United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties
may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as
great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.  Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  our  intellectual  property  is  difficult.  Litigation  may  be  necessary  to
enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights  or  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  the  proprietary  rights  of  others.  Litigation  of  this  type  could  result  in
substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign
countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value
of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

the terms of Mr. Kerkorian’s last will and testament, which provides for an orderly disposition of Tracinda’s position in our common stock. As a result, while
we expect that Tracinda’s ownership of our common stock will decline in the future, Tracinda has not indicated when, if or how it intends to sell its position

We
are
subject
to
risks
associated
with
doing
business
outside

States
. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are
inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM Macau
or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
changes in non-United States government programs;
possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;
different labor regulations;
changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
outbreaks of diseases or epidemics;
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in
relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of other
such countries will decrease.

Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
. A significant portion of our
revenue  is  derived  from  operations  outside  the  United  States,  which  exposes  us  to  complex  foreign  and  U.S.  regulations  inherent  in  doing  cross-border
business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.  We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act
(“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign
government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be
sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate
ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and
the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may
adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

We
face
risks
related
to
pending
claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
. Claims have been brought against us and our
subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution
of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our
business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 34,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A
prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could
have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and
reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an
adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, to the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks
associated with labor problems.

23

Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For
instance,  Borgata’s  most  significant  plan  is  the  Legacy  Plan  of  the  National  Retirement  Fund,  Former  HEREIU  and  Local  54,  which  has  been  listed  in
“critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must a dopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding
improvement  or  rehabilitation  plan,  which  may  require  additional  contributions  from  employers  (which  may  take  the  form  of  a  surcharge  on  benefit
contributions) and/or modifications to retiree b enefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the
future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) th at would vary
based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.

Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
. We are a large consumer of electricity
and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may
have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation
to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

The
failure
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
computer
systems
and
internal
customer
information
could
result
in
damage
of
reputation
and/or
subject
us
to
fines
, payment
of
damages
, lawsuits
or
restrictions
on
our
use
or
transfer
of
data
. We collect and store information relating to our employees and guests for
various  business  purposes,  including  marketing  and  promotional  purposes.  The  collection  and  use  of  personal  data  are  governed  by  privacy  laws  and
regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent
from one jurisdiction to another.

Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and
services  to  our  guests.  In  addition,  non-compliance  with  applicable  privacy  regulations  by  us  (or  in  some  circumstances  non-compliance  by  third  parties
engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in
damage  of  reputation  and/or  subject  us  to  fines,  payment  of  damages,  lawsuits  or  restrictions  on  our  use  or  transfer  of  data.  We  rely  on  proprietary  and
commercially  available  systems,  software,  tools  and  monitoring  to  provide  security  for  processing,  transmission  and  storage  of  customer  and  employee
information,  such  as  payment  card  and  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information.  Our  data  security  measures  are  reviewed  and  evaluated  regularly;
however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in
the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our
computer  systems,  through  cyber  attacks  or  otherwise,  could  impact  our  ability  to  service  our  customers  and  adversely  affect  our  sales  and  the  results  of
operations. For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been
compromised  and  company  data  has  been  destroyed.  Our  information  systems  and  records,  including  those  we  maintain  with  our  third-party  service
providers,  may  be  subject  to  cyber  security  breaches  in  the  future.  In  addition,  our  third-party  information  system  service  providers  face  risks  relating  to
cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of
customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to
our  operations  and  management  team,  and  result  in  remediation  expenses,  regulatory  penalties  and  litigation  by  customers  and  other  parties  whose
information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divest
some
of
our
properties
and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other
businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions and
investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:

•

•

•

•
•
•
•
•

spending cash and incurring debt;
assuming contingent liabilities;
unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
retaining key employees; and

24

•

consolidating corporate and administrative infras tructures.

We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  be  able  to  identify  opportunities  or  complete  transactions  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all,  or  that  we  will
actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances.

In addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business,
are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell these
identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

•

•

If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
, our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
. State and local authorities raise a significant
amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or
in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts
to  raise  revenues  through  increases  in  gaming  taxes.  If  the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate  were  to  increase  gaming  taxes  or  fees,  depending  on  the
magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For instance,
income generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in Macau, which exempts us from
paying the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games. This exemption is effective through March 31, 2020, which also
runs concurrent with the end of the term of the current gaming subconcession. Due to the uncertainty concerning taxation after the subconcession renewal
process, we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond March 31, 2020.

Conflicts
of
interest
may
arise
because
certain
of
our
directors
and
officers
are
also
directors
of
MGM
China
 , the
holding
company
for
MGM
Grand
Paradise
which
owns
and
operates
MGM
Macau
. As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock, MGM China now has
stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM China may
have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implications
for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to the
appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

Unconsolidated
Affiliates

CityCenter occupies approximately 67 acres of land between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The main site, along with substantially all of CityCenter’s assets, serves as
collateral  for CityCenter’s  senior secured credit  facility.  As of December  31, 2016, CityCenter had not drawn on its $75 million  revolving credit  facility  and had $1.2
billion in term loans outstanding. These borrowings are non-recourse to us.

The Las Vegas Arena Company leases under a long-term ground lease approximately 17 acres of land owned by us and located between Frank Sinatra Drive and
New York-New York, adjacent  to the  Las Vegas  Strip. Substantially  all  of  the assets  of Las  Vegas Arena  Company are  used as  collateral  for  its senior  secured  credit
facility. In connection with this senior secured credit facility, we and Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (“AEG”) each entered into a repayment guarantee for the term
loan  B  (which  is  subject  to  increases  and  decreases  in  the  event  of  a  rebalancing  of  the  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  between  the  term  loan  A  and  term  loan  B

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

Securities
and
derivative
litigation.
  In 2009 various shareholders filed six lawsuits in Nevada federal and state court against the Company and various of its
former  and  current  directors  and  officers  alleging  federal  securities  laws  violations  and/or  related  breaches  of  fiduciary  duties  in  connection  with  statements  allegedly
made by the defendants during the period August 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 (the “class period”). In general, the lawsuits asserted the same or
similar allegations, including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the Company’s common stock price by knowingly making materially false and
misleading statements and omissions to the investing public about the Company’s financial statements and condition, operations, CityCenter, and the intrinsic value of the
Company’s common stock; that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain Company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale of Company
common stock to the public; that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase Company common stock at artificially inflated prices; and that defendants
imprudently  implemented  a  share  repurchase  program  to  the  detriment  of  the  Company.  The  lawsuits  sought  unspecified  compensatory  damages,  restitution  and
disgorgement of alleged profits and/or attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial, as well as injunctive relief related to corporate governance.

The state and federal court derivative actions were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motions. In November 2009, the U.S. District Court for Nevada consolidated

the remaining cases Robert
Lowinger

MGM

Securities
Litigation,
Case
No.
2:09-cv-01558-GMN-LRL.
  The consolidated  case  names  the  Company and  certain  former  and
current directors and officers as def endants and alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. In January
2011,  lead  plaintiffs  filed  a  consolidated  amended  complaint,  alleging  that  between  August  2,  2007  and  March  5,  2009,  the  Compa  ny,  its  directors  and  certain  of  its
officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In July 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants agreed in principle to settle the securities class actions. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants entered
into  a Stipulation  and  Agreement  of Settlement  (the  “Settlement  Agreement”).  Under  the  terms  of the  Settlement  Agreement,  the claims  against  the  Company and  the
named former and current directors and officers will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $75 million cash payment by the Company’s directors and
officers liability insurers.

On March 1, 2016, the court entered a Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice (the “Final Judgment”) of the two cases consolidated under In
re
MGM
MIRAGE
Securities
Litigation
 .    Of  the  thousands  of  putative  class  members,  only  one  objected  to  the  adequacy  of  the  settlement.  The  court  entered  the  Final
Judgment over his objection, finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate to the settlement class in all respects, and dismissed the actions and all released
claims  with  prejudice  as  to  all  defendants,  and  expressly  provided  that  neither  the  settlement  nor  associated  negotiations  and  proceedings  constitute  an  admission  or
evidence of liability, fault or omission by the defendants.

On March 25, 2016, the sole objector to the adequacy of the settlement filed a Notice of Appeal as to the Final Judgment and related orders entered by the court
concerning the plan of settlement distribution and award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the lead plaintiffs’ counsel. The appeal has been fully briefed and is awaiting an
order from the court of appeals.

If the Final Judgment is reversed on appeal, the case would be remanded and the Company and all other defendants plan to continue to vigorously defend against

the claims asserted in these securities cases.

Other.

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not believe

that the outcome of such pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 3,881 record holders of our common stock as of February 24, 2017.

On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share. This dividend is payable on March 15, 2017, to stockholders of
record  as  of  the  close  of  business  on  March  10,  2017.  The  amount,  declaration  and  payment  of  any  future  dividends  will  be  subject  to  the  discretion  of  our  Board  of
Directors and the contractual limitations described below who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant. In addition, as a
holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds
from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictive covenants that could
restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the MGM National Harbor, Operating Partnership, and MGM China credit facilities each
contain limitations on the ability of the applicable subsidiary under each credit agreement to pay dividends to us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay
dividends in the future.

In 2016, we recorded a $401 million gain for our share of CityCenter’s gain on the sale of the Shops at Crystals (“Crystals”). The gain included $200 million
representing  our  share  of  the  gain  recorded  by  CityCenter  and  $201  million  representing  the  reversal  of  certain  basis  differences.  The  basis  differences
primarily related to other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded on our investment in CityCenter that were allocated to Crystals’ building assets.
In  2016,  we  received  proceeds  of  $1.2  billion  and  paid  $75  million  in  issuance  costs  in  connection  with  MGP’s  IPO.  See  Note  1  to  the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In 2016, we recorded a gain of $430 million on the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s ownership interest in Borgata. Upon acquisition of Borgata on August 1,
2016, we began consolidating the results of Borgata and ceased recording of Borgata’s results as an equity method investment.
In 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort in Prince George’s County at National Harbor, which is a
waterfront development located on the Potomac River just outside of Washington, D.C.

In  2012,  we  recorded  non-cash  impairment  charges  of  $85  million  related  to  our  investment  in  Grand  Victoria,  $65  million  related  to  our  investment  in
Borgata, $366 million related to our land on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip, $167 million related to our Atlantic City land and $47 million for the South
Jersey Transportation Authority special revenue bonds we hold.
In 2012, we recorded a charge of $18 million related to our share of the CityCenter residential real estate impairment charge and a charge of $16 million
related to our share of CityCenter’s Harmon demolition costs.
In 2012, we recorded a $563 million loss on debt retirement in connection with the February 2012 amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility
and in connection with our December 2012 refinancing transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
C
ONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

Executive
Overview

Our  primary  business  is  the  ownership  and  operation  of  casino  resorts,  which  offer  gaming,  hotel,  convention,  dining,  entertainment,  retail  and  other  resort
amenities. We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of
our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts
to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We make significant investments
in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 1%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 6% and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue
increased by less than 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Results of operations
for our domestic resorts during 2016 benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and REVPAR, and the results of our
Profit Growth Plan, discussed below. Our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to the Las Vegas market and robust convention business at our Las Vegas
Strip resorts, which allowed us to yield higher room rates across our portfolio of resorts.

Gross gaming revenues in the Macau market decreased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, and gross gaming revenues decreased 34% in 2015 compared to 2014. As a
significant  number  of  MGM  Macau’s  customers  are  from  mainland  China,  we  believe  operating  results  were  negatively  affected  by  economic  conditions  in  mainland
China as well as certain policy initiatives in mainland China and Macau. Specifically, a continuing slowdown in China’s economic growth rate, the Chinese government’s
restrictions on travel and cross-border currency transactions, new compliance regulations for gaming promoters and gaming operators enacted by the Macau government
and implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 and a ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables in an attempt to eliminate “proxy” bets have all negatively affected MGM
Macau’s high-end customers and the gaming promoters with which we conduct our VIP casino gaming operations. In addition, the Chinese government’s anti-corruption
campaign has changed consumption patterns and affected the propensity of our clients to spend on certain areas like gaming or luxury items. The Macau government also
implemented a full main floor casino smoking ban in October 2014. These factors led to a continued decrease in gross gaming revenues for the Macau market beginning in
the  second  half  of  2014  and  lasted  into  2016  primarily  impacting  VIP  casino  gaming  operations  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  main  floor  operations  throughout  the  Macau
market. Despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in China, we expect the Macau market to grow on a long-term basis due to
further development, penetration of the mainland China market and infrastructure improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau, and we
believe recent trends reflect stabilization within the Macau market. According to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, after
several  quarters  of  declines  in  visitation  throughout  2015,  visitor  arrivals  increased  slightly  by  1%  and  overnight  visitors  increased  10%  in  2016  compared  to  2015.
Additionally, gross gaming revenue increased year over year in each of the months from August 2016 through December 2016.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be
focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. In Macau, we estimate costs to develop MGM Cotai will
be  approximately  $3.3  billion,  excluding  development  fees  eliminated  in  consolidation,  capitalized  interest  and  land  related  costs.  MGM  Cotai  is  a  casino  resort  with
capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in
Macau. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to be
less than our 500 gaming table capacity. MGM Cotai is expected to open in the second half of 2017.

We were awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be developed on approximately 14
acres of land in downtown Springfield. MGM’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-
room  hotel;  100,000  square  feet  of  retail  and  restaurant  space;  44,000  square  feet  of  meeting  and  event  space;  and  a  3,375-space  parking  garage;  with  an  expected
development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. Construction of MGM Springfield is expected to
be completed in late 2018.

In August 2015, we announced the implementation of a Profit Growth Plan for sustained growth and margin enhancement. The Profit Growth Plan’s initiatives
focused on improving business processes to leverage our scale for greater efficiency and lower costs, and to identify areas of opportunity to organically drive incremental
revenue growth. The Profit Growth Plan included a large number of initiatives to optimize operations and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further
improvement. In June 2016,

32

we  announced  that  we  expect  to  achieve  approximately  $400  million  of  annualized  Adjusted  EBITDA  benefit  compared  to  our  baseline,  which  we  expect  to  be  fully
realized by the end of 2017.

Formation
and
Initial
Public
Offering
of
MGP

On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) completed its IPO of 57,500,000 of its Class A shares representing limited liability company interests
(inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 Class A shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. MGP used the proceeds
from the IPO to purchase Operating Partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), to which we contributed the
real estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit
and Beau Rivage in exchange for Operating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership in connection with the IPO.

MGP is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and
substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the Operating Partnership. MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchange
for 26.7% of the units in the Operating Partnership. The general partner of the Operating Partnership is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP. As a result, MGP controls
and consolidates the Operating Partnership. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a
single Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations
of MGP or upon liquidation  or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders  are entitled  to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the Class B share, are
entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate
beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. As such, we control MGP through our majority
voting rights and consolidate MGP in our financial results. Subsequent to our acquisition of Borgata and subsequent contribution of Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP as
discussed below, our ownership in the Operating Partnership, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. As a result of the Borgata transaction, MGP’s ownership in the Operating
Partnership was correspondingly reduced from 26.7% to 23.7%.

In  connection  with  the  formation  of  MGP,  we  borrowed  $4.0  billion  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  the  proceeds  of  which  were  used  to  repay  outstanding
obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. The bridge facilities were subsequently
assumed by the Operating Partnership pursuant to the master contribution agreement. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds
from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the IPO.

Acquisition
of
Borgata
Hotel
Casino
&
Spa

On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a
consolidated subsidiary of ours. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of Borgata and resulting consolidation of
Borgata,  which  we  previously  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.  See  Note  4  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional  information.
Following completion of the acquisition, MGP subsequently acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for MGP’s assumption of $545 million
of  indebtedness  from  our  subsidiary  and  the  issuance  of  $27.4  million  Operating  Partnership  units  to  our  subsidiary.  In  connection  with  the  Borgata  transaction,  we
borrowed  $545  million  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  which  were  subsequently  contributed  to  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating  Partnership  repaid  the  bridge
facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on their revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its
4.5% senior notes due 2026. Pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, MGP leased back the real property of Borgata to a subsidiary of ours and as a result, initial rent
payments to MGP increased by $100 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata transaction. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of
this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.

Reportable
Segments

We have two reportable segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own and operate 14 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations
consist  of  MGM  Macau  resort  and  the  development  of  MGM  Cotai  on  the  Cotai  Strip  in  Macau.  We  have  additional  business  activities  including  investments  in
unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a
fee. Our operations that are not segregated into separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to
consolidated results.

33

Domestic
resorts.
At December 31, 2016, our domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Other:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The
Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo and Circus Circus Las Vegas.
MGM  Grand  Detroit  in  Detroit,  Michigan;  Beau  Rivage  in  Biloxi,  Mississippi;  Gold  Strike  Tunica  in  Tunica,
Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; and MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-
gaming  amenities.  We  market  to  different  customer  groups  and  utilize  our  significant  convention  and  meeting  facilities  to  maximize  hotel  occupancy  and  customer
volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts,
which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities. Also, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our domestic resorts in
Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the
United States generally.

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our domestic resorts are:

•

•

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our
normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 19% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is in the range of 8.5% to 9% of
slots handle; and
Hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,”
a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day,
includes  the  impact  of  complimentary  rooms.  Complimentary  room  rates  are  determined  based  on  an  analysis  of  retail  or  “cash”  rates  for  each  customer
segment  and each  type  of room product  to estimate  complimentary  rates  which are consistent  with retail  rates. Complimentary  rates  are  reviewed at least
annually  and  on  an  interim  basis  if  there  are  significant  changes  in  market  conditions.  Because  the  mix  of  rooms  provided  on  a  complimentary  basis,
particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the
ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

MGM
China.
Subsequent to the acquisition of an additional 4.95% of the outstanding common shares of our MGM China subsidiary in September 2016, we own
an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates MGM Macau and the related
gaming  subconcession  and  land  concessions,  and  is  in  the  process  of  developing  MGM  Cotai.  We  believe  our  investment  in  MGM  China  plays  an  important  role  in
extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability.

Revenues at MGM Macau are generated from three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market: VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming
operations, and slot machine operations. VIP players play mostly in dedicated VIP rooms or designated gaming areas. VIP customers can be further divided into customers
sourced  by  in-house  VIP  programs  and  those  sourced  through  gaming  promoters.  A  significant  portion  of  our  VIP  volume  is  generated  through  the  use  of  gaming
promoters. Gaming promoters introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these players.
In  exchange  for  their  services,  gaming  promoters  are  compensated  through  payment  of  revenue-sharing  arrangements  or  rolling  chip  turnover  based  commissions.  In-
house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. MGM Macau main floor operations primarily consist of walk-in
and  day  trip  visitors.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.  The  profit  contribution  from  the  main  floor
segment  exceeds  the  VIP  segment  due  to  commission  costs  paid  to  gaming  promoters.  Gaming  revenues  from  the  main  floor  segment  have  become  an  increasingly
significant portion of total gaming revenues in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.

VIP gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from
MGM Macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming
promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the
table games turnover they generate . They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied
to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related  expenses. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts
passed through to VIP customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded
as casino expense. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.

34

In addition to the key performance ind icators used by our domestic resorts, MGM Macau utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won
by  MGM  Macau  calculated  as  nonnegotiable  chips  purchased  plus  nonnegotiable  chips  exchanged  less  nonnegotiable  chips  returned.  Turnover  p  rovides  a  basis  for
measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM Macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of turnover.

Corporate
and
other.
Corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations. See Note 1 and

Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Company’s unconsolidated affiliates.

Consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased 3% compared to 2015 due primarily to the Borgata transaction on August 1, 2016, the opening of MGM National
Harbor in December 2016 and an increase in casino revenue, rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and other revenue including parking fee revenue at our domestic
resorts, partially offset by a decrease in casino revenue at MGM China. Consolidated net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in
casino revenue at MGM China, offset by increases in casino and non-casino revenue at our domestic resorts. See “Operating Results – Detailed Segment Information”
below for additional information related to segment revenues.

Consolidated  operating  income  of  $2.1  billion  in  2016  compared  to  an  operating  loss  of  $156  million  in  2015.  Operating  income  in  2016  benefited  from  $39
million  of  operating  income  from  Borgata  subsequent  to  the  acquisition,  a  $430  million  gain  recognized  on  the  Borgata  transaction,  and  an  increase  in  income  from
unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to a $401 million gain related to the sale of Crystals at CityCenter (see “Operating Results – Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated
Affiliates”  for  further  discussion).  Operating  income  in  2016  was  also  negatively  affected  by  charges  of  $152  million  of  NV  Energy  exit  expense  associated  with  the
Company’s strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy, which includes expense at our domestic resorts as well as our 50% share of expense
recognized  at  CityCenter,  an  increase  in  preopening  expense,  and  an  increase  in  corporate  expense.  See  “Operating  Results  –  Details  of  Certain  Charges”  below  for
additional detail on our preopening expense. Corporate expense increased to $313 million in 2016, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives related to the
Profit  Growth  Plan  of  $23  million,  costs  associated  with  the  initial  public  offering  of  MGP  of  $25  million,  transaction  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the  Borgata
transaction, incremental performance-based compensation expense, and costs associated with a litigation settlement.

Consolidated operating loss of $156 million in 2015 was negatively affected by an operating loss for MGM China that included a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment
charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011. In connection with that acquisition, we recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash
gain. The 2015 impairment charge, which represents approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual review of our goodwill
carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for MGM China’s resorts based on market conditions at that time and lower valuation multiples
for gaming assets in the Macau market. In addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at MGM Macau. The operating loss for MGM China
was partially offset by an increase in operating income at our domestic resorts and an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from CityCenter, which
included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. In
addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred to implement initiatives in relation to the Profit Growth Plan of $24
million and $20 million in costs associated with the MGP transaction. Preopening expense, primarily related to our MGM Cotai, MGM Springfield and MGM National
Harbor development  projects,  increased  to  $71 million  in  2015 compared  to  $39 million  in  2014. Consolidated  operating  loss in 2015 was also negatively  affected  by
impairment  charges  and  losses  on  disposal  of  certain  assets  recorded  in  “Property  transactions,  net.”  See  “Operating  Results  –  Details  of  Certain  Changes”  below  for
additional detail related to property transactions.

Net revenue for MGM China decreased 13% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in VIP table games revenue of 26%, which was slightly
offset by a 1% increase in main floor table games revenue. VIP table games turnover decreased 24% compared to the prior year, and VIP table games hold percentage
decreased to 3.2% in 2016 from 3.3% in 2015. Slots revenue decreased 23% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an 18% decrease in slots volume. Casino revenue continued
to be negatively affected in 2016 by the changes in economic factors and policy initiatives in China that began to take place in 2014, and VIP table games revenue was
further impacted by the new regulatory compliance requirements implemented in late 2015 and in 2016 for gaming promoters and operators, as well as the curtailing of
“proxy” bets as a result of the ban on mobile phone usage at gaming tables, which began in 2016 .

MGM China’s Adjusted EBITDA was $521 million in 2016 and $540 million in 2015. Excluding branding fees of $34 million and $39 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 274 basis points to 27.1% in 2016
primarily as a result of an increase in main floor table games mix and cost reduction efforts.

Net  revenue  for  MGM  China  decreased  33%  in  2015  compared  to  2014  primarily  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  VIP  table  games  revenue  of  44%,  as  well  as  a
decrease in main floor table games revenue of 20%. VIP table games turnover decreased 54% compared to the prior year, while VIP table games hold percentage increased
to 3.3% in 2015 from 2.8% in 2014. Slots revenue decreased 20%

in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 23% decrease in slots volume. Casino revenue was negatively affected throughout 2015 by the changes in economic factors and policy
initiatives in China that began to take place in 2014.

MGM China’s Adjusted EBITDA was $540 million in 2015 and $850 million in 2014. Excluding branding fees of $39 million and $43 million for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 35% compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 150 basis points to
24.4% in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in casino revenue.

Corporate
and
other.
 Corporate  and  other  revenue  includes  revenues  from  other  corporate  operations,  management  services  and  reimbursed  costs  revenue
primarily  related  to  our  CityCenter  management  agreement.  Reimbursed  costs  revenue  represents  reimbursement  of  costs,  primarily  payroll-related,  incurred  by  us  in
connection with the provision of management services and was $397 million, $399 million and $383 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA related to corporate and other in 2016 increased due to our gain recognized from the sale of Crystals at CityCenter. See “Operating Results –
Income  (Loss)  from  Unconsolidated  Affiliates”  for  further  discussion.  The  increase  in  income  from  unconsolidated  affiliates  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in
corporate expense discussed previously under “Summary Operating Results” and an increase in stock-based compensation.

Adjusted EBITDA related to corporate and other in 2015 included our share of operating income from CityCenter, including certain basis difference adjustments,
compared to our share of operating loss from CityCenter in the prior year, and an increase in our share of operating income from Borgata in 2015 compared to 2014. See
“Operating Results – Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion. The increases in income from CityCenter and Borgata were partially offset by
increased corporate expenses as discussed previously under “Summary Operating Results.”

Preopening and start-up expenses increased in 2016 due primarily to an increase in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM National Harbor (which opened in
December of 2016) and an increase in preopening and start-up expenses at MGM China related to MGM Cotai (which is expected to open in 2017). Preopening and start-
up expenses at MGM China include $7 million of amortization  of the Cotai land concession premium in each of the years ended December  31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Preopening and start-up expenses at MGM National Harbor include $15 million, $19 million and $13 million of rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively, which relates to the ground lease for the land on which MGM National Harbor was developed.

We  completed  our  acquisition  of  Borgata  on  August  1,  2016,  at  which  time  the  subsidiary  operating  Borgata  became  a  consolidated  subsidiary.  Prior  to  the

acquisition, we held a 50% interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method.

In 2016, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $445 million, which included $13 million related to our
share of NV Energy exit expense representing CityCenter’s share of a charge associated with our strategic decision to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy,
$41 million related to our share of accelerated depreciation related to the April 2016 closure of the Zarkana theatre, as well as $401 million related to our share of a gain
recognized by CityCenter on the sale of Crystals and the reversal of certain basis differences. At Aria, casino revenues decreased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a
7% decrease in table games volume partially offset by an increase in hold percentage to 24.6% in 2016 compared to 23.8% in 2015. The decrease in table games revenue
was partially offset by a 2% increase in slots revenue. REVPAR increased by 4% and 8% at Aria and Vdara, respectively, which led to a 7% increase in CityCenter’s
rooms revenue in 2016 compared to 2015.

In 2015, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $159 million and included $80 million related to our share
of a gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements, compared to an operating loss of $12 million in
2014. Casino revenue at Aria increased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to an increase in table games volume and slots volume of 2% and 3%, respectively.
CityCenter’s  rooms  revenue  increased  5%  in  2015  compared  to  2014,  due  to  increases  in  REVPAR  of  6%  and  8%  at  Aria  and  Vdara,  respectively.  The  increase  in
revenues from resort operations was partially offset by a decrease in residential revenues. CityCenter’s operating income in 2015 benefited from a $99 million decrease in
depreciation expense as a result of certain furniture and equipment becoming fully depreciated in December 2014 offset in part by $20 million in accelerated depreciation
for certain assets associated with the Zarkana theatre, which was closed in April 2016. CityCenter’s operating income also benefited from a $26 million decrease in legal
and  professional  fees  as  a  result  of  the  final  resolution  of  construction  litigation  and  related  settlements.  Our  share  of  Borgata’s  operating  income  increased  in  2015
compared to 2014 due to an increase in casino and non-casino revenues and improved operating margins.

In 2016, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding MGM China, decreased compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average long-term
debt outstanding, and also due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in amortization of debt issuance cost associated with the
MGP related financing transactions in April 2016. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in the average outstanding
amounts  borrowed  under  the  MGM  China  credit  facility  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  amortization  of  debt  issuance  costs.  In  2015,  interest  cost  related  to  MGM
Resorts,  excluding  China,  decreased  compared  to  2014  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  the  average  long-term  debt  outstanding  during  the  year  related  to  our  senior  notes.
Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in the average outstanding amounts borrowed under the MGM China credit
facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred associated with the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility in June
2015.

Capitalized  interest in 2016 increased  compared  to 2015 due primarily  to the MGM Cotai, MGM National  Harbor, and MGM Springfield projects.  Capitalized
interest in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due primarily to the MGM Cotai, MGM National Harbor, and MGM Springfield projects, and our investment in Las Vegas
Arena Company, LLC.

Non-operating
items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $23 million in 2016 compared to 2015,
due primarily to the acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, at which time the subsidiary operating Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of our company. Prior to
the acquisition, we held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates
decreased $11 million in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at CityCenter.

Other,
net.
Other  expense  increased  in  2016 compared  to  2015 due  primarily  to  a  $16 million  loss  on  the  early  retirement  of  debt  related  to  the  $743 million
7.625%  senior  notes  due  2017,  as  well  as  a  $49  million  loss  incurred  on  the  early  retirement  of  debt  related  to  the  $1.23  billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our
outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 and our prior senior credit facility, recorded in the second quarter of 2016.

Our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryovers and
permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the Borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred tax
liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the Macau complementary tax on gaming profits. Our effective tax rate in
2015  was  unfavorably  impacted  by  the  non-cash  impairment  charge  on  MGM  China  goodwill  for  which  we  did  not  record  income  tax  benefit.  Our  effective  tax  rate
decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially
offset by tax benefit resulting from audit settlements in 2014.

41

Cash taxes paid increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in federal income taxes paid due to increased U.S. taxable income. Cash
taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the closure of the IRS
examination of CityCenter, which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes which partially offset federal income tax estimated tax payments of $23 million made
during the year. The remaining $5 million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes.

Non-GAAP
Measures

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses,
NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA
before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to both the MGM Resorts and MGP stock-based compensation plans, which are not allocated to each
reportable  segment  or  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  its  stock-based  compensation  plan  which  is
included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. “Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted Property EBITDA related to the operating resorts
which were consolidated by the Company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA information is
presented  solely  as  a  supplemental  disclosure  to  reported  GAAP  measures  because  management  believes  these  measures  are  1)  widely  used  measures  of  operating
performance in the gaming and hospitality industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming and hospitality companies. We present Adjusted Property EBITDA on
a “same-store” basis as supplemental information for investors because management believes that providing performance measures on a “same-store” basis is useful for
evaluating the period-to-period performance of our domestic casino resorts.

We  believe  that  while  items  excluded  from  Adjusted  EBITDA,  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  and  Same-Store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  may  be  recurring  in
nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to
other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being
presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up
expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies
within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of
assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on
entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and
stock  compensation  awards  are  all  managed  at  the  corporate  level.  Therefore,  we  use  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  and  Same-store  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  as  the
primary measure of domestic resorts operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net
income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  We  have  significant  uses  of  cash  flows,  including  capital  expenditures,  interest  payments,  taxes  and  debt

Cash
Flows
–
Summary

We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize company-wide cash management
procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are
invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding
debt  securities  subject  to  limitations  in  our  senior  credit  facility.  At December  31,  2016  and  2015,  we held  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of  $1.4  billion  and  $1.7  billion,
respectively.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  related  to  MGM  China  at  December  31,  2016  and  2015  was  $454  million  and  $700  million,  respectively.  Cash  and  cash

Operating
activities.
Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in
working  capital,  cash  paid  for  interest,  the  timing  of  significant  tax  payments  or  refunds,  and  distributions  from  unconsolidated  affiliates.  Cash  provided  by  operating
activities was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in 2015. Operating cash flows increased in the current period due to an increase in operating income at our
domestic resorts and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes. Cash provided by operating activities in the prior year was
negatively affected by changes in working capital primarily related to short-term gaming liabilities.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China which were $383 million in 2015 compared to

$642 million in 2014, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our domestic resorts.

45

In 2015, cash provided by operating activities at MGM China was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to short-term gaming liabilities but to a lesser
extent than in 2014.

We paid net taxes of $68 million, $12 million and $42 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Investing
activities.
Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments
in  new  or  existing  resorts,  business  acquisitions  or  dispositions,  and  the  timing  of  more  regular  capital  investments  to  maintain  the  quality  of  our  resorts.  Capital
expenditures related to more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel
rooms. Most of such costs relate to construction materials, furniture and fixtures, and external labor costs.

a $15 million dividend and a $22 million dividend to its Class A shareholders in July 2016 and October 2016, respectively. In August 2016, MGM China paid an interim
dividend of $58 million, of which $29 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests. In June 2016, MGM China paid a final dividend of $46 million of which $23
million was distributed to noncontrolling interests.

MGM China paid a $400 million special dividend in March 2015, a $120 million final dividend in June 2015 and a $76 million interim dividend in August 2015, of
which $196 million, $59 million and $37 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests, respectively. Additionally, we received $6 million in 2015 related to proceeds
from the issuance of non-voting membership interests in MGM National Harbor. MGM China paid a $499 million special dividend in March 2014, a $127 million final
dividend in June 2014, and a $137 million interim  dividend in September  2014, of which $245 million,  $62 million  and $67 million  was distributed to noncontrolling
interests, respectively.

Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity

Anticipated
uses
of
cash.
 We have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. At December 31, 2016, we
had  $13.1  billion  in  principal  amount  of  indebtedness,  including  $250  million  of  borrowings  outstanding  under  our  $1.5  billion  senior  credit  facility,  $2.1  billion
outstanding  under  the  $2.73  billion  Operating  Partnership  credit  facility,  $1.9  billion  outstanding  under  the  $3.0  billion  MGM  China  credit  facility  and  $450  million
outstanding under the $525 million MGM National Harbor credit facility. We have an estimated $751 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt
and applicable interest rates within the next twelve months including the estimated impact of changes in our interest rates on the MGP term loan B and new interest rate
swap agreements entered into subsequent to year end. We believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal and interest obligations as well as
planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends and
distributions from MGM China and the Operating Partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit facility, the Operating Partnership
credit facility and the MGM National Harbor credit facility.

47

In addition, we have made significant investments through December 31, 2016 and we expect to make capital investments as described below during 2017. See

“Executive Overview” for fur ther information regarding the scope and timing of our significant development projects.

•
•
•

Approximately $530 million in capital expenditures at our domestic resorts and corporate entities, excluding MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield;
Approximately $270 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM Springfield project; and
Approximately $150 million in capital expenditures related to MGM National Harbor.

During 2017, MGM China expects to spend approximately $100 million in maintenance capital improvements at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai once opened, and

$990 million on the MGM Cotai project, excluding capitalized interest, development fees and land related costs.

Our  capital  expenditures  fluctuate  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capital  investments  in  new  or  existing  resorts  and  the  timing  of  capital
investments to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel
rooms.  Future  capital  expenditures  could  vary  from  our  current  expectations  depending  on  the  progress  of  our  development  efforts  and  the  structure  of  our  ownership
interests in future developments.

MGM
Resorts
International
dividends.
On February 15, 2017 the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend to holders of record on March 10, 2017 of
$0.11 per share, totaling $63 million, which will be paid on March 15, 2017. Our intention is to pay a quarterly dividend in each future quarter subject to our operating
results,  cash  requirements  and  financial  conditions,  any  applicable  provisions  of  state  law  that  may  limit  the  amount  of  funds  available  to  us,  and  compliance  with
covenants  and  financial  ratios  related  to  existing  or  future  agreements  governing  the  indebtedness  at  our  subsidiaries  and  any  limitations  in  other  agreements  such
subsidiaries may have with third parties.

MGP
distributions.
On December 15, 2016, MGP’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3875 per Class A share totaling $22 million, which
was paid on January 16, 2017 to holders of record on December 31, 2016. We concurrently received a $72 million distribution attributable to Operating Partnership units
owned by us from the Operating Partnership, which remained within the consolidated entity. MGP expects to pay quarterly distributions in cash of approximately  $22
million, equal to $0.3875 per share ($89 million on an annualized basis, equal to $1.55 per share) to its Class A shareholders, which amount may be changed in the future
without advance notice.

MGM
China
dividend.

On February 16, 2017, as part of its regular dividend policy, the Board of Directors of MGM China announced it will recommend a final
dividend for 2016 of $78 million to MGM China shareholders subject to approval at the MGM China 2017 annual shareholders meeting to be held in May. If approved, we
will receive our 56% share or $44 million, of which $4 million will be paid to Grand Paradise Macau under the $50 million deferred cash payment arrangement related to
our  acquisition  of  the  additional  4.95%  of  MGM  China  shares  in  August  of  2016.  See  Note  13  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
information regarding the deferred cash payment.

Principal
Debt
Arrangements

As discussed in “Executive Overview” in connection with the formation and IPO of MGP, we and MGP entered into several financing transactions including new

principal debt agreements. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding those agreements.

In April 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement comprised of a $1.25 billion revolving facility and a $250 million term loan A facility.
The revolving facility and the term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of LIBOR
plus 1.75% to 2.75%. Both the term loan A facility and the  revolving  facility will mature in April 2021. The term loan A facility is subject to amortization of principal in
equal quarterly installments (commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017), with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan A facility to
be payable each year. No amounts have been drawn on the revolving credit facility.

The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,
including that we maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We were
in compliance with our amended and restated credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

48

The amended and restated credit  agreement is secured by (i)  a  mortgage  on the real  properties  comprising  the  MGM Grand  Las Vegas and  the Bellagio,  (ii)  a
pledge of substantially all existing and future personal property of our subsidiaries that own  the  MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio; and (iii) a pledge of the equity
or limited liability company interests of the entities that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio.

Mandatory  prepayments  of the credit facilities will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the

incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights.

In April 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a credit agreement comprised of a $300 million senior secured term loan A facility, a $1.85 billion senior
secured term loan B facility, and a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term loan B facility was originally issued at 99.75% to initial leaders. The
revolving credit facility and term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which results in an interest rate of LIBOR
plus 2.25% to 2.75%. On October 26, 2016 the term loan B facility was re-priced at par and bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, which
represented a 50 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate. In addition, the Operating Partnership received a further reduction in pricing to LIBOR plus 2.50%, with
a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, as a result of it achieving a minimum corporate family rating of Ba3/BB- in February 2017. The revolving credit facility and the term loan A
facility will mature in 2021 and the term loan B facility will mature in 2023. The term loan facilities are subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments,
with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan A facility and 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan B facility to be payable
each year.

The Operating Partnership credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,
including that the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, maximum total net debt to adjusted
assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

MGM China and MGM Grand Paradise, as co-borrowers, are parties to a fourth amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loans
and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on HIBOR plus a margin that ranges between 1.375% and 2.5%
based on MGM China’s leverage ratio. The credit facility matures in April 2019, with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in October 2017. The
MGM  China  credit  facility  is  secured  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  interest  in  the  Cotai  land  use  right,  and  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  and  their  guarantor
subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility.

The MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that
MGM  China  maintains  compliance  with  a  maximum  leverage  ratio  and  a  minimum  interest  coverage  ratio.  MGM  China  was  in  compliance  with  its  credit  facility
covenants at December 31, 2016. In February 2017, the MGM China credit facility was amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 through
December 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 at March 31, 2018, 5.00 to 1.00 at June 30, 2018 and 4.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2018 and thereafter.

In January 2016, MGM National Harbor, LLC entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million term loan
facility. The revolving and term loan facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by MGM National Harbor, LLC’s total leverage ratio (2.25% as
of  December  31,  2016).  The  term  loan  and  revolving  facilities  are  scheduled  to  mature  in  January  2021  and  the  term  loan  facilities  are  subject  to  scheduled
amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening date of MGM National Harbor, initially in an
amount  equal  to  1.25%  of  the  aggregate  principal  balance  and  increasing  to  1.875%  and  2.50%  of  the  aggregate  principal  balance  on  the  last  day  of  the  twelfth  and
sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respectively.

The MGM National Harbor credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on MGM National Harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property
of  MGM  National  Harbor.  Mandatory  prepayments  will  be  required  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  sales  of  certain  assets,  casualty  events  and  the
incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In addition, to the extent MGM National Harbor generates excess cash
flow (as defined in the MGM National Harbor credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be
required to be used to prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ending 2017.

The MGM National Harbor credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,
including that MGM National Harbor, LLC and its restricted subsidiaries maintain compliance with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
MGM National Harbor, LLC was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in CityCenter, Grand
Victoria,  and  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company,  LLC.  We  have  not  entered  into  any  transactions  with  special  purpose  entities,  nor  have  we  engaged  in  any  derivative
transactions, other than our MGP cash flow hedges. See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our unconsolidated
affiliate investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale resort or other entertainment  properties in a manner that minimizes our initial
investment. We guarantee the T-Mobile Arena credit facility as described below. In addition, there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we
believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

In conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC entering into a senior secured credit facility in September 2014, we and AEG each entered into joint and
several  completion guarantees  for the project  (which were subsequently terminated  in February 2017), as well as a repayment guarantee  for the term loan B (which is
subject  to  increases  and  decreases  in  the  event  of  a  rebalancing  of  the  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  between  the  term  loan  A  and  term  loan  B  facilities).  As  of
December 31, 2016, term loan A was $150 million and term loan B was $50 million.

Estimated  interest  payments  are  based  on  principal  amounts  and  expected  maturities  of  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2016  and  management’s  forecasted
LIBOR rates for our senior credit facility and HIBOR rates for the MGM China credit facility. In December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interest
rate  swap  agreements  to  mitigate  the  interest  rate  risk  inherent  in  its  senior  secured  term  loan  B  facility.  These  interest  rate  swaps  are  designated  as  cash  flow
hedges  and  have  a  notional  value  of  $500  million  and  mature  on  November  30,  2021.  The  weighted  average  fixed  rate  paid  is  1.825%,  and  the  variable  rate
received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.
The  amount  for  2017  includes  $471  million  related  to  MGM  Cotai  and  $39  million  and  $76  million  related  to  MGM  National  Harbor  and  MGM  Springfield,
respectively.
The table above excludes our future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed in Note 19 to
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We own 76.3% of the Operating Partnership units as of December 31, 2016. MGM National Harbor is located
on land subject to a long-term ground lease. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Approximately $12 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax liabilities are excluded from the table as we cannot reasonably estimate
when examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.
The  amount  for  2017  includes  $124  million  related  to  employment  agreements,  $129  million  for  entertainment  agreements  and  $120  million  of  open  purchase
orders.  Other  commitments  include  various  contracted  amounts,  including  information  technology,  advertising,  maintenance  and  other  service  agreements.  Our
largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments to Cirque du Soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. Our contractual
commitments  for these shows generally  do not exceed 12 months and are based on our ability  to exercise  certain  termination  rights;  however, we expect these
shows to continue for longer periods.

While  we  have  significant  indebtedness  and  other  obligations,  we  believe  we  have  the  ability  to  meet  known  obligations,  including  principal  and  interest
obligations  as  well  as  planned  capital  expenditures  over  the  next  twelve  months  from  the  balance  sheet  date  with  existing  cash  and  cash  deposits,  cash  flows  from
operations, dividends and distributions from MGM China and the

50

Operating Partnership, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit facility, the Operating Partnership credit facility and the MGM National
Harbor c redit  facility.  We  have  $138  million  of  maturities  of  long-term  debt  in  2017.  See  “Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  –  Other  Factors  Affecting  Liquidity”  for
further discussion of anticipated uses of cash.

Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates

Management’s  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  results  of  operations  and  liquidity  and  capital  resources  are  based  on  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  To
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and
assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  regularly  evaluate  these  estimates  and  assumptions,  particularly  in  areas  we
consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates,
and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual
results can differ from our estimates.

Allowance
for
Doubtful
Casino
Accounts
Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the
same  extent,  although  we  offer  markers  to  customers  at  those  casinos  as  well.  MGM  China  extends  credit  to  certain  in-house  VIP  gaming  customers  and  gaming
promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely.
These  collection  efforts  are  similar  to  those  used  by  most  large  corporations  when  dealing  with  overdue  customer  accounts,  including  the  mailing  of  statements  and
delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States
and  Macau.  At  December  31,  2016  and  2015,  approximately  53%  and  42%,  respectively,  of  our  casino  accounts  receivable  at  our  domestic  resorts  were  owed  by
customers from the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be
reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 35% and 37%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable at
our domestic resorts were owed by customers from the Far East. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to
customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming
promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit.

We  maintain  an  allowance,  or  reserve,  for  doubtful  casino  accounts  at  all  of  our  operating  casino  resorts.  The  provision  for  doubtful  accounts,  an  operating
expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not
significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant,
we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance
over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. MGM China
specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection
history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.

In  addition  to  enforceability  issues,  the  collectability  of  unpaid  markers  given  by  foreign  customers  at  our  domestic  resorts  is  affected  by  a  number  of  factors,
including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant,
the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy
occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

Approximately $35 million and $40 million of casino receivables and $8 million and $9 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to

MGM China at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Casino receivables increased in the

51

current year as a result of the Borgata transaction and the opening of MGM Nationa l Harbor. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts
receivable has decreased in the current year due to a decrease in the age of outstanding account balances. At December 31, 2016, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance
for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $3 million.

Fixed
Asset
Capitalization
and
Depreciation
Policies

Property and equipment  are stated at cost. For the majority  of our property and equipment, cost was determined  at the acquisition date based on estimated  fair
values in connection with the August 2016 Borgata acquisition, the June 2011 MGM China acquisition, the April 2005 Mandalay acquisition and the May 2000 Mirage
Resorts acquisition. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the
project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated
with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using
the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially
complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We  must  make  estimates  and  assumptions  when  accounting  for  capital  expenditures.  Whether  an  expenditure  is  considered  a  maintenance  expense  or  a  capital
asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also
may  be  a  matter  of  judgment.  In  addition,  our  depreciation  expense  is  highly  dependent  on  the  assumptions  we  make  about  our  assets’  estimated  useful  lives.  We
determine  the  estimated  useful  lives  based  on  our  experience  with  similar  assets,  engineering  studies,  and  our  estimate  of  the  usage  of  the  asset.  Whenever  events  or
circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Indefinite-lived
Intangible
Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several
criteria  must  be  met  before  an  asset  is  classified  as  held  for  sale,  including  that  management  with  the  appropriate  authority  commits  to  a  plan  to  sell  the  asset  at  a
reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or
fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we
review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value,
then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby
future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our
industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for
sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To
the  extent  management  decides  that  an  asset  will be  sold,  it  is  more  likely  that  an  impairment  may  be  recognized.  Assets  must be  tested  at  the  lowest  level  for  which
identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are,
by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

On  a  quarterly  basis,  we  review  our  major  long-lived  assets  to  determine  if  events  have  occurred  or  circumstances  exist  that  indicate  a  potential  impairment.
Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors,
significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability
weight  cash  flows  in  certain  circumstances  to  consider  alternative  outcomes  associated  with  recoverability  of  the  asset  group,  including  potential  sale.  Historically,
undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

We  review  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain  circumstances.  We  perform  our  annual
impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights, which are
tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. See Note 8 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

52

Goodwill  repre  sents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  the  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations.  We  test  goodwill  for  relevant
reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and in interim periods if circumstances exist suc h that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill (commonly referred to as “step
zero”)  in  order  to  determi  ne  whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  we  take  into  account  macroeconomic  conditions,
industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets
of reporting units. In addition, management takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that
was performed, as well as the pe riod of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, further quantitative analysis is not required. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis.

Under the two-step quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted
future results discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry,
and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in
our peer group. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if
any. In measuring an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. If
the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value.

With  the  exception  of  our  MGM  China  reporting  unit,  discussed  below,  none  of  our  other  reporting  units  incurred  any  goodwill  impairment  charges
in 2016, 2015 or 2014. For our 2016 annual impairment test, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our domestic resorts reporting units and
concluded  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  such  reporting  units  exceeded  their  carrying  values  by  a  substantial  margin.  The  estimated  fair  values  of
reporting units for which we elected to forego the step zero analysis and instead utilized the two-step quantitative analysis were substantially in excess of their carrying
values. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet
current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of our reporting units, including our MGM China
reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair value
resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGM China
reporting unit as well as those of the MGM China reporting unit’s peer group. As a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to
perform a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As such, we determined the fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including
its separately identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant
amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill.  Therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of
goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit to its implied fair value in 2015.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual
results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are
highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment.

Impairment
of
Investments
in
Unconsolidated
Affiliates

We  evaluate  our  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  our
investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying
value  to  determine  whether  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determine  whether  the  impairment  is  other-than-temporary  based  on  our  assessment  of  relevant  factors,
including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash
flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on
a range of multiples in our peer group. See Note 7 and Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment
charges.

Income
Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a

future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

As of December 31, 2016, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.8 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion based upon
our assessment of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because
MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  presently  exempt  from  the  Macau  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits,  we  believe  that  payment  of  the  Macau  Special  Gaming  Tax
qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes.

On September 7, 2016, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax exemption through March 31, 2020, concurrent with
the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. A competitor of MGM Grand Paradise subsequently received an additional extension of its exemption through
March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. Based upon these developments and the uncertainty concerning
taxation after the concession renewal process, we have concluded that we can no longer assume that MGM Grand Paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periods
beyond the end of the extension recently granted. Thus, for all periods beyond March 31, 2020, we have assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12%
complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits  and  will  thus  not  be  able  to  credit  the  Macau  Special  Gaming  Tax  in  such  years,  and  have  factored  that  assumption  into  our
assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and the measurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities.

Due to improvements in our U.S. operations, we have generated U.S. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of June 30, 2016 we no longer
had  cumulative  U.S.  losses  in  recent  years.  Consequently,  during  2016  we  began  to  rely  on  future  U.S.  source  operating  income  in  assessing  future  foreign  tax  credit
realization during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.

Our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and
distributions from MGM China and assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a
valuation allowance  and changes to our assumptions may have a material  impact  on the amount of the valuation allowance. For example, a change to our forecasts of
future profitability of and distributions from MGM China or a change in our assumptions concerning U.S. profitability could result in a material change in the valuation
allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in such period. In addition, should we in a future period actually receive an additional exemption
from  the  complementary  tax,  an  additional  valuation  allowance  would  likely  need  to  be  provided  on  some  portion  or  all  of  the  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,
resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.

In addition, there is a $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million on
certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely
than not” criteria for recognition.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign
jurisdictions are not material. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax
returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately  be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 12 in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record as a
result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” or long-term in
“Other  long-term  liabilities”  based  on  the  time  until  expected  payment.  Additionally,  we  recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties,  if  any,  related  to  unrecognized  tax
benefits in income tax expense.

Stock-based
Compensation

We account for stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) measuring fair value using the Black-Scholes model. For restricted share units (“RSUs”),

compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.

54

We account for performance stock units (“PSUs”) measuring fair value using the Monte Carlo valuation model. There are several management assumptions required to
determine the inputs into the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo valuation model. Our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model can
significantly affect the fair value of stock options and SARs. The Monte Carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the
fair value of the award. Changes in the subjective  assumptions can material  ly affect  the estimate  of the fair value of share-based  compensation and consequently, the
related amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year.

Market
Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated
with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term
borrowings  under  our  bank  credit  facilities.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debt
instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes
in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

In December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B
facility. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on November 30, 2021. The weighted average
fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%. In January 2017, the Operating
Partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount to pay a fixed rate of 1.964% and
receive the 1-month LIBOR rate in order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility. The Company does not currently have any
master netting arrangements related to its derivative contracts. See Note 11 for additional information.

As of December 31, 2016, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 32% of our total borrowings after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount
Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR (in the case of the MGP term loan B facility, over the 0.75%
floor specified in the Operating Partnership credit facility and after giving effect to the $500 million notional amount Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussed
above), our annual interest cost would increase by $23 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in HIBOR
for  the  MGM  China  credit  facility,  our  annual  interest  cost  would  increase  by  $19  million  based  on  amounts  outstanding  at  December  31,  2016.  The  following  table
provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the Operating Partnership interest rate swaps
discussed above:

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly
related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant,
potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange
rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the
same  level.  The  possible  changes  to  the  peg  of  the  Hong  Kong  dollar  may  result  in  severe  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  thereof.  As  of  December  31,  2016,  a  1%
increase in the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $4
million and a 1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $20 million.

Responsibilities

M
ANAGEMENT’S
ANNUAL
REPORT
ON
INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER
FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of

the Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
of
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial reporting, management has developed and maintained a system of internal control, policies and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this annual
report is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this annual report. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that
this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
for all timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Significant elements of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting include, for example:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them appropriately;
Written accounting policies;
Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;
Segregation of incompatible duties;
Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control; and
Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Management’s
Evaluation

Management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, the Company has excluded the operations of Marina District
Development Company, LLC, which owns and operates Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa (“Borgata”) because these operations were acquired in a business combination on
August 1, 2016. These operations  represent  approximately  7% of the Company’s total assets at December  31, 2016 and approximately  4% of the Company’s total net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company intends to disclose any material changes in internal control over financial reporting with respect to the
Borgata operations in the year ending December 31, 2017, the first annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting in which it is required to include Borgata.

Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2016, management believes that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in achieving the

objectives described above.

reporting and such report is also included in this annual report.

PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MGM Resorts International

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described
in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
Marina District Development Company, LLC (the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa), which was acquired on August 1, 2016, and whose financial statements constitute 7% of
total assets and 4% of total net revenues of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, our
audit  did  not  include  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  at  Marina  District  Development  Company,  LLC.  The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for
maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the
accompanying  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such other  procedures  as  we considered  necessary  in  the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  by,  or  under  the  supervision  of,  the  company’s  principal  executive  and  principal
financial  officers,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  and  effected  by  the  company’s  board  of  directors,  management,  and  other  personnel  to  provide  reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria

FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MGM Resorts International

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and
2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December  31,  2016.  Our audits  also  included  the  financial  statement  schedule  of  Valuation  and  Qualifying  Accounts  included  in  Item  15(a)(2).  These  financial
statements  and  the  financial  statement  schedule  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries
as  of  December  31,  2016  and  2015,  and  the  results  of  their  operations  and  their  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2016,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  March  1,  2017,  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.

Organization.
MGM Resorts International  (the “Company” together with its consolidated subsidiaries) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding
company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts. The Company owns and operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in
Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur and Circus Circus Las Vegas.
Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a condominium-hotel consisting of three towers. Along with local
investors, the Company owns and operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The Company owns and operates the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage
in  Biloxi  and  Gold  Strike  in  Tunica.  Subsequent  to  its  acquisition  on  August  1,  2016,  the  Company  owns  and  operates  the  Borgata  Hotel  Casino  &  Spa  (“Borgata”),
located on Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey. See Note 4 for additional information on the Borgata transaction. The Company owns and
operates  Shadow  Creek,  an  exclusive  world-class  golf  course  located  approximately  ten  miles  north  of  its  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts,  Primm  Valley  Golf  Club  at  the
California/Nevada state line and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. Additionally , the Company owns and operates MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s
County, Maryland, which opened on December 8, 2016.

On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 57,500,000
of  its  Class  A  shares  representing  limited  liability  company  interests  (inclusive  of  the  full  exercise  by  the  underwriters  of  their  option  to  purchase  7,500,000  Class  A
shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. In connection with the IPO, the Company and MGP entered into a series of transactions and several agreements that,
among other things, set forth the terms and conditions of the IPO and provide a framework for the Company’s relationship with MGP.

MGP is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and
substantially  all  of  its  businesses  are  conducted  through,  its  Operating  Partnership  subsidiary,  MGM  Growth  Properties  Operating  Partnership  LP  (the  “Operating
Partnership”). MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 26.7% of the Operating Partnership units representing limited
partner  interests  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  general  partner  of  the  Operating  Partnership  is  also  a  subsidiary  of  MGP.  MGP  has  two  classes  of  authorized  and
outstanding  voting  common  shares  (collectively,  the  “shares”):  Class  A  shares  and  a  single  Class  B  share.  The  Company  owns  MGP’s  Class  B  share,  which  does  not
provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A
shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while the Company, as the owner of the Class B share, is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total
voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests
in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%.

Pursuant  to  a  master  contribution  agreement  entered  into  in  connection  with  the  IPO  by  and  between  the  Company,  MGP  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  the
Company contributed the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM
Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage to newly formed subsidiaries and subsequently transferred 100% ownership interest in such subsidiaries to the Operating Partnership in
exchange for 73.3% of the Operating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership on the closing date of the IPO. In addition, on August 1, 2016, the Company completed
its acquisition of Borgata and subsequently contributed Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP, as discussed in Note 4. As a result of the Borgata transaction, as discussed in
Note  20,  the  Company’s  indirect  ownership  in  the  Operating  Partnership  units  increased  to  76.3%  and  MGP’s  Class  A  shareholders’  ownership  interest  in  Operating
Partnership units was reduced to 23.7%. The Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or
cash at the fair value of a Class A share. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee. See Note 10 and Note 19 for
additional information related to MGP, the IPO and certain other intercompany agreements and debt financing transactions entered into in connection therewith.

The Company acquired an additional 4.95% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”) on September 1, 2016, which increased its ownership to
approximately 56%. See Note 14 for additional information. The Company has a controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM
Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the
process of developing an 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity
for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be
determined  by  the  Macau  government  prior  to  opening,  and  such  allocation  is  expected  to  be  less  than  MGM  Cotai’s  500  gaming  table  capacity.  The  total  estimated
project budget is $3.3 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

73

The Company owns 50% of and manages CityCenter Hold ings, LLC (“CityCenter”), located between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The other 50% of CityCenter is
owned by Infinity World Development Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter consis ts
of  Aria,  an  integrated  casino,  hotel  and  entertainment  resort;  Mandarin  Oriental  Las  Vegas,  a  non-gaming  boutique  hotel;  and  Vdara,  a  luxury  condominium-hotel.  In
addition,  CityCenter  features  residential  units  in  the  Residences  at  Mandarin  Oriental  and  Veer.  In  April  2016,  CityCenter  closed  the  sale  of  The  Shops  at  Crystals
(“Crystals”), a retail, dining and entertainment district. See Note 7 and Note 19 for additional information related to CityCenter.

The  Company  and  a  subsidiary  of  Anschutz  Entertainment  Group,  Inc.  (“AEG”)  each  own  42.5%  of  the  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company,  LLC  (“Las  Vegas  Arena
Company”), the entity which owns the T-Mobile Arena, subsequent to the sale of a 7.5% ownership interest by each of the Company and AEG to Athena Arena, LLC on
September 1, 2016. The Company manages the T-Mobile Arena, which is located on a parcel of the Company’s land between Frank Sinatra Drive and New York-New
York,  adjacent  to  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.  The  T-Mobile  Arena  is  a  20,000  seat  venue  designed  to  host  world-class  events  –  from  mixed  martial  arts,  boxing,  hockey,
basketball  and  bull  riding,  to  high  profile  awards  shows  and  top-name  concerts.  T-Mobile  Arena  commenced  operations  in  April  2016.  Effective  January  1,  2016,  the
Company leases the MGM Grand Garden Arena, located adjacent to the MGM Grand Las Vegas, to the Las Vegas Arena Company. See Note 7 and Note 13 for additional
information regarding the Company’s investment in the Las Vegas Arena Company. In addition, the Company owns and operates The Park, a dining and entertainment
district, which opened in April 2016 and which connects to T-Mobile Arena, New York-New York, Monte Carlo and the Park Theater, a 5,200 seat entertainment venue
which opened in December 2016.

The Company also has a 50% interest in Grand Victoria. Grand Victoria is a riverboat casino in Elgin, Illinois; an affiliate of Hyatt Gaming owns the other 50% of

Grand Victoria and also operates the resort. See Note 7 for additional information regarding the Company’s investment in Grand Victoria.

A  subsidiary  of  the  Company  was  awarded  a  casino  license  to  build  and  operate  MGM  Springfield  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts.  MGM  Springfield  will  be
developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield. The Company’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and
100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375 space
parking garage, with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs.

The Company has two reportable segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. See Note 18 for additional information about the Company’s segments.

BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles
of
consolidation.
For entities not determined to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”), the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company
owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has the direct or indirect
ability to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling
interest  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  Company’s  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  which  are  50%  or  less  owned  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity
method  when  the  Company  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  or  has  joint  control  of  the  unconsolidated  affiliate.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  are
eliminated in consolidation.

The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A VIE
is  an  entity  in  which  either  (i)  the  equity  investors  as  a  group,  if  any,  lack  the  power  through  voting  or  similar  rights  to  direct  the  activities  of  such  entity  that  most
significantly  impact  such  entity’s  economic  performance  or  (ii)  the  equity  investment  at  risk  is  insufficient  to  finance  that  entity’s  activities  without  additional
subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that
could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, the
Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as
the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an
interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

Management  has  determined  that  MGP  is  a  VIE  because  the  Class  A  equity  investors  as  a  group  lack  the  power  through  voting  or  similar  rights  to  direct  the
activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP and
consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single

74

Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the
Company  the  right  to  receive  benefits  from  MGP  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  MGP.  The  Company  has  r  ecorded  MGP’s  26.7%  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership prior to the Borgata transaction and 23.7% interest subsequent to the Borgata transaction as noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. As of December 31, 2016, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $9.5 billion, primarily related to its real estate investments, and total liabilities of
$3.9 billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
 The consolidated  financial  statements  have been prepared  in conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the
United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
 Fair  value  measurements  affect  the  Company’s  accounting  and  impairment  assessments  of  its  long-lived  assets,  investments  in
unconsolidated  affiliates,  cost  method  investments,  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes:
Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.
The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:

•

•

•

•

•

Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 10;
Level 2 inputs when measuring the fair value of its interest rate swaps. See Note 11;
Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the Borgata transaction. See Note 4;
Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when measuring the impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. See Note 8; and
Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of its investment in Grand Victoria. See Note 7

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
 Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  investments  and  interest  bearing  instruments  with  maturities  of  90  days  or  less  at  the  date  of
acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash management program are
recorded as accounts payable or construction payable as applicable.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
 Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  casino
accounts receivable. The Company issues credit to approved casino customers and gaming promoters following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness.
At December 31, 2016, 47% of the Company’s casino receivables at its domestic resorts were due from customers residing in foreign countries and 9% of the Company’s
casino receivables related to MGM China. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts  receivable  are  typically  non-interest  bearing  and  are  initially  recorded  at  cost.  Accounts  are  written  off  when  management  deems  the  account  to  be
uncollectible.  Recoveries  of  accounts  previously  written  off  are  recorded  when  received.  An  estimated  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is  maintained  to  reduce  the
Company’s receivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as
well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2016, no significant concentrations
of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.

Inventories.
Inventories  consist primarily  of food and beverage,  retail  merchandise  and operating  supplies,  and are  stated  at  the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost
method.

Property
and
equipment.
 Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost.  A  significant  amount  of  the  Company’s  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through
business  combinations  and  therefore  recognized  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  Gains  or  losses  on  dispositions  of  property  and  equipment  are  included  in  the
determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had accrued $36 million and $17 million
for property and equipment within accounts payable and $32 million and $44 million related to construction retention accrued in other long-term liabilities, respectively.

75

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

20 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 15 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used.
Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a
reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair
market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company
reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to
the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the
carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under
development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are
recorded as operating expenses.

Capitalized
interest.
The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no
debt  is  incurred  specifically  for  a  project,  interest  is  capitalized  on  amounts  expended  on  the  project  using  the  weighted-average  cost  of  the  Company’s  outstanding
borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Investments
in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method.
Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences, as well as
capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment and recorded as
investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as gains and impairments
related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated affiliates are an
extension of the Company’s core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
its  investment  may  have  experienced  an  “other-than-temporary”  decline  in  value.  If  such  conditions  exist,  the  Company  compares  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the
investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on its assessment of all
relevant  factors,  including  consideration  of  the  Company’s  intent  and  ability  to  retain  its  investment.  The  Company  estimates  fair  value  using  a  discounted  cash  flow
analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise
value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 7 and Note 17 for results of the Company’s review of its investment in certain of
its unconsolidated affiliates.

Goodwill
and
other
intangible
assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company
performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review for
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016 and 2014. An impairment  of goodwill related  to the MGM China reporting  unit was recorded  as a result of the
annual impairment review in 2015. See Note 8.

Accounting  guidance  provides  entities  the  option  to  perform  a  qualitative  assessment  of  goodwill  (commonly  referred  to  as  “step  zero”)  in  order  to  determine
whether  further  impairment  testing  is  necessary.  In  performing  the  step  zero  analysis  the  Company  considers  macroeconomic  conditions,  industry  and  market
considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units. In
addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as
well  as  the  period  of  time  that  has  passed  since  the  last  quantitative  analysis.  If  the  step  zero  analysis  indicates  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a two-step quantitative analysis.

76

Under the two-step quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach
that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the carrying value of the reporting u nit exceeds its fair
value, an indication of impairment exists and the Company must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. To measure an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a
reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of tha t goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting
unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value
then  it  must  be  written  down  to  its  implied  fair  value.  License  rights  are  tested  for  impairment  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  approach,  and  trademarks  are  tested  for
impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to the difference.

Revenue
recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized
for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“outstanding chip liability”). Hotel, food
and  beverage,  entertainment,  retail  and  other  operating  revenues  are  recognized  as  services  are  performed  and  goods  are  provided.  Advance  deposits  on  rooms  and
advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer.

Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs. The retail value of hotel rooms,
food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The estimated cost of
providing promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Gaming
promoters.
A significant portion of the high-end (“VIP”) gaming volume at MGM Macau is generated through the use of gaming promoters, also known
as junket operators. These operators introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming credit to these
players. VIP gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips from
MGM  Macau  and  in  turn  sell  these  chips  to  their  players.  The  nonnegotiable  chips  allow  MGM  Macau  to  track  the  amount  of  wagering  conducted  by  each  gaming
promoter’s clients in order to determine VIP gaming play volume, or rolling chip turnover, which is the amount of nonnegotiable chips wagered and lost. In exchange for
the gaming promoters’ services, MGM Macau compensates the gaming promoters through revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions.
The estimated portion of the gaming promoter commissions that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the
estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense.

Reimbursed
costs.
The  Company  recognizes  costs  reimbursed  pursuant  to  management  services  as  revenue  in  the  period  it  incurs  the  costs.  Reimbursed  costs

related primarily to the Company’s management of CityCenter.

Loyalty
programs.
 The  Company’s  primary  loyalty  program  is  “M  life  Rewards”  and  is  available  to  patrons  at  most  of  the  Company’s  domestic  resorts  and
CityCenter. Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards front desk at
participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the points earned multiplied
by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed, and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue. Customers also earn Express
Comps  based  on  their  gaming  play  which  can  be  redeemed  for  complimentary  goods  and  services,  including  hotel  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  entertainment.  The
Company records a liability for the estimated costs of providing goods and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin,
less an estimate for Express Comps not expected to be redeemed and records a corresponding expense in the casino department. MGM Macau also has a loyalty program,
whereby patrons earn rewards that can be redeemed for complimentary services, including hotel rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment.

Advertising.
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense, which is generally included in general and

administrative expenses, was $171 million for 2016 and $156 million for 2015 and 2014.

expense.
 Corporate  expense  represents  unallocated  payroll,  aircraft  costs,  professional  fees  and  various  other  expenses  not  directly  related  to  the
Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities,
which are expensed as incurred.

Preopening
and
start-up
expenses.
Preopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopening and

start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.

Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on the sale

of assets as “Property transactions, net.” See Note 17 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Redeemable
noncontrolling
interest.
 In  2015,  MGM  National  Harbor  issued  non-voting  economic  interests  in  MGM  National  Harbor  (“Interests”)  to
noncontrolling interest parties, for a total purchase price of $6 million.  In 2016, MGM National Harbor issued Interests to noncontrolling interest parties for a purchase
price of $47 million. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests includes $0.5 million relating to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December
31, 2016.

The  Interests  provide  for  annual  preferred  distributions  by MGM National  Harbor  to  the  noncontrolling  interest  parties  based  on a  percentage  of  its annual  net
gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions will begin within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year in which
the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs, and after the end of each subsequent fiscal year. Also, beginning on the third anniversary of the last day of the calendar
quarter in which the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs (and on each subsequent anniversary thereof) the noncontrolling interest parties will each have the
ability  to  require  MGM  National  Harbor  to  purchase  all  or  a  portion  of  their  Interests  for  a  purchase  price  based  on  a  contractually  agreed  upon  formula.  Certain
noncontrolling interest parties each have the right to sell back all or a portion of their Interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or grant liens
to secure any indebtedness of the Company or its affiliates other than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor.

The Company has recorded the Interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  Interests  are  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.  Subsequently,  the
Company will recognize changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximum
redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused by
such  an  adjustment  in  retained  earnings  or  accumulated  deficit.  Additionally  the  carrying  amount  of  the  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  is  adjusted  for  annual
preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Currency
translation.
The Company translates the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts
are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  in  effect  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  Income  statement  accounts  are  translated  at  the  average  rate  of exchange  prevailing  during  the
period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).

Derivative
financial
instruments.
The Company reflects all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities. For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge instruments is recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized within net income. As of December 31, 2016, all of
the Company’s derivative financial instruments are interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting.

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).” The guidance is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an
organization’s management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by
organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption of
this guidance did not have an effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.

In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued the following ASUs related to revenue recognition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, pursuant to

ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”:

•

•

ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU
2014-09  provides  for  a  new  revenue  recognition  model  which  includes  a  five-step  analysis  in  determining  when  and  how  revenue  is  recognized,
including  identification  of  separate  performance  obligations  for  each  contract  with  a  customer.  Additionally,  the  new  model  will  require  revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods or services;
ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),”
clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 provides guidance related to
the assessment an entity is required to perform to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is,
the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent) when another party is
involved in providing goods or services to a customer;

80

•

•

ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” clarifies guidance related to
identifying  performance  obligations  and  licensing  implementation  guidance  as  it  relates  to  ASU  2014-09.  ASU  2016-10  includes  targeted
improvements base d on input  the  FASB received  from  the  Transition  Resource  Group for  Revenue  Recognition  and  other  stakeholders.  It  seeks  to
proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of ap plying certain aspects
of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis; and
ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” addresses narrow-scope
improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-12
provides for a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and
other similar taxes collected from customers.

The  Company  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  the  adoption  of  the  above  ASUs  related  to  revenue  recognition  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financial
statements and footnote disclosures. However, the Company has identified a few significant impacts. Under the new guidance the Company expects it will no longer be
permitted  to  recognize  revenues  for  goods  and  services  provided  to  customers  for  free  as  an  inducement  to  gamble  as  gross  revenue  with  a  corresponding  offset  to
promotional  allowances  to  arrive  at  net  revenues  as  discussed  above.  The  Company  expects  the  majority  of  such  amounts  will  offset  casino  revenues.  In  addition,
accounting for Express Comps granted under the Company’s M life Rewards program as outlined above will also change. Under the new guidance Express Comps earned
by customers through past revenue transactions will be identified as separate performance obligations and recorded as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at the
retail  value  of  such  benefits  owed  to  the  customer  (less  estimated  breakage).  When  customers  redeem  such  benefits  and  the  performance  obligation  is  fulfilled  by  the
Company, revenue will be recognized in the department that provides the goods or services (i.e. hotel, food and beverage, entertainment). In addition, given that M life
Rewards is an aspirational loyalty program with multiple customer tiers which provide certain benefits to tier members, the Company will need to assess if such benefits
are deemed to be separate performance obligations under the new guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02
requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases
will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and
amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that
adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In  August  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2016-15,  “Statement  of  Cash  Flows  (Topic  230):  Classification  of  Certain  Cash  Receipts  and  Cash  Payments  (a
consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance of
ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in
practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles, specifically clarifying the guidance on eight cash flow issues. The Company does not expect the adoption
of ASU 2016-15 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718),” (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifies the
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 has separate transition guidance for each element of the new standard. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 will
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In January 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held Through Related Parties that are Under Common Control,”
(“ASU 2016-17”). The amendments affect the evaluation of whether to consolidate a VIE in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the
amendments change the evaluation of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE for an entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest by changing
how an entity treats indirect interests in the VIE held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The guidance in ASU 2016-17 must
be applied retrospectively to all relevant periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-17 will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and
footnote disclosures.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” The amended
guidance simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amended guidance, the Company will
perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and an impairment charge will be recognized
for the amount by

81

which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit . This guidance is effective for
annual  or  any  interim  goodwill  impairment  tests  in  fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2021,  with  early  adoption  permitted  for  interim  or  annual  goodwill
impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 20 17. The Company is currently evaluating the impact and timing of adopting this guidance, but anticipates
early adoption in 2017.

On  August  1,  2016,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Boyd  Gaming  Corporation’s  (“Boyd  Gaming”)  ownership  interest  in  Borgata.  Following  the
completion of the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from the Company and leased back the real property to a subsidiary of the
Company. See Note 19 for additional information.

As part of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay Boyd Gaming half of any net amount received or utilized by the Company as it relates to
the Atlantic City property tax refund owed to Borgata at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to tax court judgments, The City of Atlantic City, New Jersey (“Atlantic
City”) owes Borgata property tax refunds of approximately $106 million, plus interest, related to the over-assessment of property values for the 2009-2012 tax years. As a
result of funding shortfalls, the City of Atlantic City has not paid the refunds due to Borgata and therefore, Borgata has withheld its current property tax obligations in
satisfaction of the tax court judgment. Borgata applied $33 million of such credits as of December 31, 2016. After taking into account contingent consideration paid related
to property tax refunds realized by Borgata, cash paid to Boyd Gaming for its interest in Borgata was $604 million.

Through the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in Borgata, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests in Borgata and therefore consolidated Borgata
as  of  August  1,  2016.  The  Company  recognized  100%  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  Borgata  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  the  acquisition.  Prior  to  the  acquisition,  the
Company held a 50% ownership interest in Borgata, which was accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of the equity interests of Borgata was determined by
the transaction price and equaled approximately $1.2 billion. The carrying value of the Company’s equity method investment was significantly less than its share of the
fair value of Borgata at the acquisition date, resulting in a $430 million gain on the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The allocation of fair value has been finalized as of December 31, 2016.

The following table sets forth the finalized allocation at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):

As discussed above, the Company recognized the identifiable intangible assets of Borgata at fair value. The trade name and customer relationship intangible assets
did not have historical cost bases at Borgata. The estimated fair values of the intangible as sets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on
significant inputs that were not observable.

Unfavorable
lease
liability.
The Company has assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11 acres of land on which the Borgata
employee parking garage, public space expansion, rooms expansion, and modified surface parking lot. The Company recorded an unfavorable lease liability of $1 million
in “Current liabilities” and $47 million in “Other long-term obligations” for the excess contractual lease obligations over the market value of the leases, which will be
amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contracts through December 2070. Both a market and income approach using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs were
utilized to determine the fair value of these leases.

Deferred
taxes.
The Company recorded an additional net deferred tax liability of $89 million, of which $82 million and $7 million was recorded to income tax
expense and goodwill, respectively. The net deferred tax liability represents the excess of the financial reporting amounts of the net assets of Borgata over their respective
basis under U.S. and New Jersey tax law expected to be applied to taxable income in the periods such differences are expected to be realized.

Consolidated
results.
Borgata’s net revenue for the period from August 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $348 million, operating income was $39 million

and net income was $8 million .

Pro
forma
information.
The operating results for Borgata are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the Company has been prepared assuming the Company’s acquisition of its controlling interest
has occurred as of January 1, 2015 and excludes the transaction gain recognized by the Company. The unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily

On April 1, 2015, the Company closed the sale of Railroad Pass. At closing, the Company received $8 million in cash proceeds. On April 30, 2015, the Company
closed the sale of  Gold Strike and related assets in Jean, Nevada.  At closing, the Company received $12 million in cash proceeds . On July 7, 2015, the Company entered
into  an  agreement  with  Eldorado  Resorts,  Inc.  to  sell  Circus  Circus  Reno,  as  well  as  the  Company’s  50%  interest  in  Silver  Legacy  and  associated  real  property.  On
November  23,  2015,  the  Company  closed  the  sale  and received $80  million  in  cash  proceeds  and recorded  a  gain  of  $23  million  related  to  the  sale,  classified  within

Circus Reno were not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded that the sales did not have a major effect on the Company’s operations or its
financial results and they do not represent a disposal of a major geographic segment or product line.

Crystals
sale.
 In  April  2016,  CityCenter  closed  the  sale  of  Crystals  for  approximately  $1.1  billion.  During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2016,  CityCenter
recognized a gain on the sale of Crystals of $400 million and the Company recognized a $401 million gain, which included $200 million representing its 50% share of the
gain  recorded  by  CityCenter  and  $201  million  representing  the  reversal  of  certain  basis  differences.  The  basis  differences  primarily  related  to  other-than-temporary
impairment charges previously recorded on the Company’s investment in CityCenter that were allocated to Crystals’ building assets.

CityCenter
distribution.
In March 2016, a $90 million distribution was declared in accordance with CityCenter’s annual distribution policy and in April 2016,
CityCenter declared a $990 million special distribution in connection with the Crystals sale. The Company’s $540 million share of such distributions was paid in May
2016. In April 2015, CityCenter declared a special distribution of $400 million, of which the Company received its 50% share of $200 million.

CityCenter’s senior secured credit facility consisted of a $75 million revolving credit facility, maturing in October 2018 and a $1.2
billion  term  loan  B  facility  maturing  in  October  2020.  CityCenter  used  cash  on  hand  to  permanently  repay  $266  million  of  the  term  loan  B  facility  during  2016.  On
January  27,  2017,  CityCenter  completed  an  amendment  to  re-price  its  $1.2  billion  term  loan  B  senior  credit  facility  and  re-price  and  extend  its  $75  million  revolving
facility. The term loan B facility was re-priced at par and will now bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% which represents a 50 basis point
reduction compared to the prior rate and a 25 basis point reduction compared to the prior LIBOR floor . The revolving facility was re-priced at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which
represents a 175 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate . The revolving facility was also extended to July 2020. All other principal provisions of the existing
credit facility remain unchanged.

Borgata

As  discussed  in  Note  4,  the  Company  acquired  Boyd  Gaming’s  ownership  interest  in  Borgata  on  August  1,  2016,  and  therefore  began  to  consolidate  Borgata

beginning on that date. Prior thereto, the Company’s investment in Borgata was accounted for under the equity method.

Grand
Victoria

At  December  31,  2015,  the  Company  reviewed  the  carrying  value  of  its  Grand  Victoria  investment  for  impairment  due  to  a  greater  than  anticipated  decline  in
operating results due in part to a continued loss of market share to video gaming terminals, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior forecast.
The  Company  used  a  blended  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  and  guideline  public  company  method  to  determine  the  estimated  fair  value  from  a  market  participant’s
viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures, a long-term
growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected based on
the  range  of  multiples  in  Grand  Victoria’s  peer  group.  As  a  result  of  the  analysis,  the  Company  determined  that  it  was  necessary  to  record  an  other-than-temporary
impairment charge of $17 million at December 31, 2015, based on an estimated fair value of $123 million for the Company’s 50% interest. The Company performed a
sensitivity analysis surrounding its long-term growth rate assumption and noted that if a long-term growth rate of 1.5% had been used, the resulting estimated fair value of
the Company’s 50% interest in Grand Victoria would have been approximately $120 million. The Company intends to, and believes it will be able to, retain its investment
in  Grand  Victoria;  however,  due  to  the  extent  of  the  shortfall  and  the  Company’s  assessment  of  the  uncertainty  of  fully  recovering  its  investment,  the  Company  has
determined that the impairment was other-than-temporary.

At June 30, 2014, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline in operating
results and loss of market share due to the proliferation of video gaming terminals in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the
prior forecast.  The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline  public company method to determine  the estimated  fair value from a market
participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows for capital expenditures, a
long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise value multiples selected
based  on  the  range  of  multiples  in  Grand  Victoria’s  peer  group.  As  a  result  of  the  analysis,  the  Company  determined  that  it  was  necessary  to  record  an  other-than-
temporary impairment charge of $29 million at June 30, 2014, based on an estimated fair value of $140 million for the Company’s 50% interest.

Las
Vegas
Arena
Company,
LLC

Athena
Arena
transaction.
 On  September  1,  2016,  the  Company  and  AEG each  sold  a  7.5%  membership  interest  in  the  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company,  LLC  to

Athena Arena, LLC. As a result of this transaction, the Company received $15 million in proceeds and recorded a $3 million gain in “Property transactions, net”.

Arena
financing.
In September  2014, a subsidiary  of Las Vegas Arena Company entered  into  a senior  secured  credit  facility  to finance  construction  of the T-
Mobile Arena. In connection with this senior credit facility, MGM Resorts International and AEG each entered into a repayment guarantee for the term loan B (which is
subject to increases and decreases in the event of rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities). As of December
31, 2016, the senior secured credit facility consisted of a $150 million term loan A and a $50 million term loan B. The senior secured credit facility matures in September
2019. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the Las Vegas Arena Company, and contains certain financial covenants which became
applicable upon the opening of the T-Mobile Arena in April 2016. I n accordance

85

with the Las Vegas Arena Company’s senio r secured credit facility, the Company and AEG contributed equal amounts totaling $175 million for construction, all of which
had been contributed as of December 31, 2015. See Note 13 for discussion of the Company’s joint and several completion and repayme nt guarantees related to the Las
Vegas Arena Company.

Silver
Legacy

Silver
Legacy
sale.
As discussed in Note 5, the Company closed the sale of its 50% interest in Silver Legacy on November 23, 2015, received proceeds of $58
million, and recorded a gain of $20 million. The Company’s investment in Silver Legacy was not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded
that the sale would not have a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it did not represent a disposal of a major geographic segment or product
line.

Goodwill concerning domestic resorts relates to the acquisition of Mirage Resorts in 2001, the acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group in 2005, and the acquisition
of  Borgata  in  August  2016.  See  Note  4  for  goodwill  recognized  in  connection  with  the  Borgata  transaction.  The  Company  recognized  goodwill  resulting  from  its
acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill by reviewing each of its reporting units, including its MGM
China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair
value resulted from a decrease in forecasted cash flows based on then current market conditions and a sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGM
China reporting unit as well as the multiples of the reporting unit’s peer group.

As a result of the indication of impairment from its step one analysis, the Company performed a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As
such, the Company determined the fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of each
of  the  separately  identifiable  intangible  assets  exceeded  their  respective  carrying  values  by  a  significant  amount,  leading  to  a  lower  implied  fair  value  of  goodwill.
Therefore, the Company recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit to
its implied fair value. The carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit as of December 31, 2015 following the impairment charge was $1.4 billion.

Indefinite-lived
intangible
assets.
 The  Company’s  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  development  rights  in  Detroit,  trademarks  and  license

rights, of which $210 million consists of trademarks and trade names related to the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition and $83 million related to the Borgata trade name.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
gaming
subconcession.
Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos de Macau,
S.A., a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of 15 years
commencing on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms of the agreement;
however, management believes that the gaming subconcession will be extended, given that the Cotai land concession agreement with the government extends significantly
beyond the gaming subconcession. As such, the Company is amortizing the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the term of the Cotai land
concession, ending in January 2038.

MGM
Macau
land
concession.
MGM Grand Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencing from
April 6, 2006. The land use right has an initial term through April 6, 2031, subject to renewal for additional periods. The land concession intangible asset is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining initial contractual term.

Customer
lists.
 The  Company  recognized  an  intangible  asset  related  to  MGM  China’s  customer  lists,  which  was  amortized  on  an  accelerated  basis  over  its

estimated useful life of five years. The MGM China customer list intangible asset became fully amortized

89

in 2016. The Company recognized an intangible asset related to the Borgata customer list, which is amortized on an accelerated basis over its estimated useful life of two
years and five months.

Gaming
licenses.
The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland. The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the license fee of $22
million  is  considered  a  finite-lived  intangible  asset  that  is  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  a  period  of  15  years,  beginning  in  December  2016,  when  the  casino
started operations. The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Massachusetts. The consideration paid to the State of Massachusetts for the license fee of $85
million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casino resort.

Other.
The  Company’s  other  finite–lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  lease  acquisition  costs  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  related  leases,  and  certain

license rights amortized over their contractual life.

Total amortization expense related to intangible assets was $180 million, $199 million and $232 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Estimated future

amortization is as follows:

Debt due within one year of the December 31, 2016 balance sheet was classified as long-term as the Company has both the intent and ability to refinance current
maturities on a long-term basis under its revolving senior credit facilities with the exception that $8 million of MGP’s quarterly amortization payments under its senior
credit facility were classified as current because MGP used cash to make such amortization payments in January 2017. At December 31, 2015, the amount available under
the  Company’s  revolving  senior  credit  facility  was  less  than  current  maturities  related  to  the  Company’s  term  loan  credit  facilities  and  senior  notes.  The  Company
excluded from the December 31, 2015 current portion of long-term debt the amount available for refinancing under its revolving credit facility.

Senior
credit
facility.
In April 2016, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement comprised of a $1.25 billion revolving facility and a
$250 million term loan A facility. The revolving facility and the term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid which
results in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.75%. Both the term loan A facility and the  revolving  facility will mature in April 2021. The term loan A facility is
subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments (commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017), with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal
amount of the term loan A facility to be payable each year. No amounts have been drawn on the revolving credit

91

facility. The Company incurred a loss on early retirement of its prior credit facility of approximately $28 million recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of
operations. At December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan A facility was 3.02%.

The amended and restated credit agreement contains representations and warranties, customary events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants,
including that the Company maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
The Company was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

The  amended  and  restated  credit  agreement  is  secured  by (i)  a  mortgage  on the  real  properties  comprising  the  MGM Grand  Las  Vegas  and the  Bellagio,  (ii)  a
pledge  of  substantially  all  existing  and  future  personal  property  of  the subsidiaries  of the  Company that  own the  MGM Grand  Las Vegas  and the  Bellagio;  and  (iii)  a
pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the entities that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio.

Mandatory  prepayments  of  the  credit  facilities  will  be  required  upon the  occurrence  of  certain  events,  including  sales  of certain  assets,  casualty  events  and  the

incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights.

MGM
Growth
Properties
senior
credit
facility.
In April 2016, the Operating Partnership  entered  into a credit  agreement  comprised  of a $300 million  senior
secured term loan A facility, a $1.85 billion senior secured term loan B facility, and a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term loan B facility was
originally issued at 99.75% to initial lenders. The revolving credit facility and term loan A facility bear interest determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing
grid which results in an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75%. On October 26, 2016 the term loan B facility was re-priced at par and bore interest at LIBOR plus
2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, which represented a 50 basis point reduction compared to the prior rate. In addition, the Operating Partnership received a further
reduction in pricing to LIBOR plus 2.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% as a result of it achieving a minimum corporate family rating of Ba3/BB- in February 2017. All
other principal provisions of the existing credit facility remain unchanged. The revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility will mature in 2021 and the term loan
B facility will mature in 2023.

The term loan facilities are subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments, with 5.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan
A facility and 1.0% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the term loan B facility to be payable each year. The Company permanently repaid $8 million of the term
loan A facility and $9 million of the term loan B facility for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the term loan A facility had an amount outstanding
of $293 million with an interest rate of 3.52% and the term loan B facility had an amount outstanding of $1.84 billion with an interest rate of 3.52%. No amounts were
drawn on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016.

The  credit  agreement  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  and  positive,  negative  and  financial  covenants,  including  that  the
Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, maximum total net debt to adjusted assets ratio and a
minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

MGM
China
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2016, the MGM China credit facility consisted of $1.55 billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit
facility,  which  bear  interest  at  a  fluctuating  rate  per  annum  based  on  HIBOR  plus  a  margin  that  ranges  between  1.375%  and  2.5%  based  on  MGM  China’s  leverage
ratio. The MGM China credit facility matures in April 2019, with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in October 2017. The MGM China credit
facility is secured by MGM Grand Paradise’s interest in the Cotai land use right, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a
security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2016 was comprised of $1.56 billion of term loans and
$374 million drawn on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was 2.73% and the interest rate on the
revolving credit facility was 2.50%.

The MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that
MGM  China  maintains  compliance  with  a  maximum  leverage  ratio  and  a  minimum  interest  coverage  ratio.  MGM  China  was  in  compliance  with  its  credit  facility
covenants at December 31, 2016. In February 2017, the MGM China credit facility was amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio to 6.00 to 1.00 through
December 31, 2017, declining to 5.50 to 1.00 at March 31, 2018, 5.00 to 1.00 at June 30, 2018 and 4.50 to 1.00 at September 30, 2018 and thereafter.

MGM
National
Harbor
credit
agreement.
In January 2016, MGM National Harbor, LLC entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving
credit facility and a $425 million term loan facility. The revolving and term loan facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by MGM National
Harbor, LLC’s total leverage ratio (2.25% as of December 31, 2016). The term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in January 2021 and the term loan
facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening

92

date of MGM National Harbor, initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal
balance on the last day of the twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respec tively. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2016 was comprised of $425 million of
term loans and $25 million drawn on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan was 3.02% and the interest rate on the revolvi
ng credit facility was 2.90%.

The credit  agreement  is secured by a leasehold  mortgage  on MGM National Harbor and substantially  all of the existing and future property of MGM National
Harbor.  Mandatory  prepayments  will  be  required  upon the  occurrence  of certain  events,  including  sales  of  certain  assets,  casualty  events  and  the  incurrence  of  certain
additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In addition, to the extent MGM National Harbor generates excess cash flow (as defined in
the credit agreement), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging from 0% to 50% based on a total leverage ratio) will be required to be used to prepay the term loan
facilities commencing with the fiscal year ending 2017.

The credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that MGM
National Harbor, LLC and its restricted  subsidiaries maintain compliance with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. MGM National
Harbor, LLC was in compliance with its credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2016.

Senior
Notes.
On August 19, 2016, the Company issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2026 for net proceeds of $493
million. I n September 2016, t he Company used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem the $743 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its
7.625% senior notes due 2017. T he Company incurred a loss on early retirement of the 7.625% senior notes of approximately $16 million recorded in “Other, net” in the
consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the closing of the IPO, on May 25, 2016 (the “Redemption Date”) the Company redeemed for cash all $1.23
billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and 10% senior notes due 2016 in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture.
The Company incurred a loss on early retirement of such notes of approximately $22 million recorded in “Other, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.

In 2015, the Company repaid its $875 million 6.625% senior notes at maturity. The senior notes are unsecured and otherwise rank equally in right of payment with
the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured obligations, primarily
consisting of its senior credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations.

Bridge
Facilities.
In  connection  with  the  Borgata  transaction  in  August 2016, the  Company  borrowed  $545 million  under  certain  bridge  facilities,  which  were
subsequently contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on its
revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from its offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. In connection with the closing of the IPO, the
Company borrowed $4.0 billion under certain bridge facilities, the proceeds of which were used to repay its outstanding obligations under its prior senior credit facility
and were used to repay its 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and its 10% senior notes due 2016 on the Redemption Date. The bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by the
Operating  Partnership  pursuant  to  the  master  contribution  agreement.  The  Operating  Partnership  repaid  the  bridge  facilities  with  a  combination  of  proceeds  from  its
financing transactions described in Note 1 and the proceeds from the IPO.

 On  August  12,  2016,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  MGP  Finance  Co-Issuer,  Inc.  issued  $500  million  in  aggregate
principal amount of 4.5% senior notes due 2026 for net proceeds of $492 million. On April 20, 2016, a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership issued $1.05 billion in
aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2024 and on April 25, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered  into a supplemental  indenture through which it
assumed the obligations under the notes from such subsidiary (which merged into the Operating Partnership on such date) .

Convertible
senior
notes.
In April 2015, holders of substantially all of the $1.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes elected to
convert the notes into approximately 78 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The notes were converted at 53.83 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal
amount,  which  is  equivalent  to  a  conversion  price  of  approximately  $18.58  per  share.  In  addition,  the  Company  settled  the  capped  call  transactions  entered  into  in
connection with the initial issuance of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of notes and received approximately 6 million shares from such financial institutions. Such
shares received in connection with the capped call transactions were subsequently retired.

DERIVATIVES
AND
HEDGING
ACTIVITIES

The Operating Partnership uses derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility inherent in its variable rate debt, which could unfavorably

impact its future earnings and forecasted cash flows. The Operating Partnership does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

In December 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B
facility. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and have a notional value of $500 million and mature on November 30, 2021. The weighted average
fixed rate paid is 1.825%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%.

The following table summarizes the fair value and the presentation in the Company’s balance sheet:

As of December  31, 2016, all of the interest  rate swaps were valued in net unrealized  gain positions and recognized  as asset balances  within “Other long-term
assets, net.” For the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount recorded in other comprehensive income related to the gain on derivative instruments was $2 million. For
the year ended December  31, 2016, there  was no ineffective  portion  of the change  in fair  value derivatives.  During the fourth  quarter  of 2016, the Company recorded
interest expense of $0.4 million related to the swap agreements.

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our

variable-rate debt. During the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017, the Company estimates that $4 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

In January 2017, the Operating Partnership entered into additional interest rate swap agreements through November 2021 with a total $700 million notional amount
to pay a fixed rate of 1.964%, and the variable rate received resets monthly to the one-month LIBOR, subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%, in order to mitigate the interest
rate risk inherent in its senior secured term loan B facility.

Income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  which  is  owned  by  MGM  China,  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax,
pursuant to approval from the Macau government. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $25 million
in 2016, and “Net loss attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have increased by $25 million in 2015 and net income per share (diluted) would have decreased
by $0.04 in 2016 and net loss per share (diluted) would have increased by $0.04 in 2015.

Non-gaming operations remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. MGM Grand Paradise had at December 31, 2016 a complementary tax net operating loss

carryforward of $593 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2017 through 2019.

MGM Grand Paradise’s exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGM
China.  However,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  has  an  agreement  with  the  Macau  government  to  settle  the  12%  complementary  tax  that  would  otherwise  be  due  by  its
shareholder,  MGM  China,  on  distributions  of  its  gaming  profits  by  paying  a  flat  annual  payment  (“annual  fee  arrangement”)  regardless  of  the  amount  of  distributable
dividends. Such annual fee arrangement was effective until December 31, 2016. MGM China was not subject to the complementary tax on distributions it received during
the  covered  period  as  a  result  of  the  annual  fee  arrangement.  Annual  payments  of  $2  million  were  required  under  the  annual  fee  arrangement.  The  $2  million  annual
payments  for  2016  and  2015  were  accrued  and  a  corresponding  provision  for  income  taxes  was  recorded  in  each  year.  MGM  Grand  Paradise  intends  to  file  for  an
extension of this agreement in the first quarter of 2017.

96

However, no assurance can be given that an extension will be granted or that the terms if granted will not be less favorable than the prior ag reement.

The  Company  repatriated  $53  million  and  $304  million  of  foreign  earnings  and  profits  in  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2016,  there  were
approximately $363 million of unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits, all of which the Company anticipates will be repatriated without the incurrence of additional
U.S. income tax expense due to creditable foreign taxes associated with such earnings and profits. Such foreign taxes consist of the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which the
Company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. income taxes. Accordingly, no deferred tax liability had been recorded for
those earnings. The Company had foreign tax credit carryovers of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 which will expire as follows: $731 million in 2022; $976 million
in 2023; $786 million in 2024; and $331 million in 2025. The foreign tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below.

For state income tax purposes, the Company had Illinois, New Jersey, and Michigan net operating loss carryforwards of $93 million, $166 million, and $77 million
at December 31, 2016, respectively, which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance, of $5 million, $3 million, and $3 million,
respectively. The Illinois net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2026. The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if
not utilized by 2029 through 2036. The Michigan net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2022 through 2024.

The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $2.5 billion against the $2.8 billion foreign tax credit deferred tax asset at December 31, 2016. In addition, there
was a $3 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $71 million on certain Macau deferred tax
assets, and a valuation allowance of $2 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not”
criteria for recognition.

The foreign tax credits are attributable  to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is
presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid
in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. On September 7, 2016, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an additional extension of the complementary tax
exemption through March 31, 2020, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. A competitor of MGM Grand Paradise subsequently received
an additional extension of its exemption through March 31, 2020, which also runs concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming concession. Based upon these
developments and the uncertainty concerning taxation after the concession renewal process, the Company has concluded that it can no longer assume that MGM Grand
Paradise will be entitled to additional exemption periods beyond the end of the extension recently granted. Thus, for all periods beyond March 31, 2020, the Company has
assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the Macau Special Gaming Tax in
such years, and has factored that assumption into the assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset. This change resulted in a reduction in the
valuation allowance against the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset in the amount of $169 million with a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes in
2016.

Due to improvements in its U.S. operations, the Company has generated U.S. operating profits for the past eight consecutive quarters and as of June 30, 2016 no
longer  had  cumulative  U.S.  losses  in  recent  years.  Consequently,  during  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016  the  Company  began  to  rely  on  future  U.S.  source  operating
income  in  assessing  future  foreign  tax  credit  realization  during  the  10-year  foreign  tax  credit  carryover  period.  This  change  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuation
allowance and a corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes of $85 million in 2016.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $9 million and $8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015,

respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company accrued less than $1 million in
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015. No amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date. Income tax expense for the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes interest benefit and expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as follows: less than $1 million expense in 2016, $4
million benefit in 2015, and $13 million benefit in 2014.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid
in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2016, the Company is no longer subject to examination of its U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns
filed for years ended prior to 2010. During 2016, the IRS opened an examination of the Company’s 2014 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return and notified the
Company that it would open an examination of the 2014 income tax return of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for income tax
purposes. During 2015, the Company received final approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of the 2009 tax year and agreed
to all IRS adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC. The Company received a refund of $16 million of taxes and associated interest in
connection  with  the  settlement  of  these  examinations,  which  are  now  considered  settled  for  financial  accounting  purposes.  During  2014,  the  Company  received  final
approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of its consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years;
the 2007 through 2008 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC; the 2008 through 2009 tax years of MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, a subsidiary treated as a partnership for
income tax purposes; and the 2005 through 2009 tax years of Marina District Development Holding Company, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as a partnership for
income tax purposes during such years. These examinations are now considered settled for financial reporting purposes. The Company previously deposited $30 million
with the IRS to cover the expected cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for these examinations.

As of December 31, 2016, other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the Company was no longer subject to examination
of  its  various  state  and  local  tax  returns  filed  for  years  ended  prior  to  2012.  During  2015,  the  state  of  New  Jersey  completed  its  examination  of  Marina  District
Development  Holding  Company,  LLC  for  the  2003  through  2009  tax  years.  All  adjustments  were  agreed  to  by  the  members  of  Marina  District  Development  Holding
Company, LLC and the examination is now considered settled for financial accounting purposes. The Company made a $1 million payment of tax and associated interest
as a result of this settlement. No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

The Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 will change materially within the next twelve months.

Leases.
The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide

for escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals.

At December 31, 2016, the Company was obligated under non-cancellable operating leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

The table above excludes the Company’s future lease obligations to a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership pursuant to the master lease agreement discussed in
Note 19. The Company owns 76.3% of the Operating Partnership units as of December 31, 2016. The current obligations of $9 million under capital leases due within one
year  are  included  in  “Other  accrued  liabilities”  and  the  long-term  obligations  of  $5  million  under  capital  leases  due  after  one  year  are  included  in  “Other  long-term
obligations”. Rental expense for operating leases was $80 million, $74 million and $65 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amounts included short term rentals
charged to rent expense. Rental expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014 includes $7 million related to the Cotai land concession. The

98

Company accounts for the Cotai land concession contract as an operating lease for which the required upfront payments are amortized over the initial 25-year contract
term. Rent recognized for the Cotai land concession is included in “P reopening and start-up expenses” prior to opening.

In August 2016, in connection with the Borgata transaction, the Company has assumed the liability of a series of ground leases for a total of approximately 11
acres  of  land  on  which  the  Borgata  employee  parking  garage,  public  space  expansion,  rooms  expansion,  and  modified  surface  parking  lot.  The  Company  recorded  an
unfavorable lease liability for the excess contractual lease obligations over the market value of the leases, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease contracts through December 2070. The ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease with rental expense of $2 million for the year ended December 31,
2016.

In April 2013, the Company entered into a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23 acre parcel of land in connection with the MGM National Harbor project.
The ground lease has an initial term of 25 years and the right to extend for up to 13 additional six year periods with the first 7 of those additional periods considered to be
reasonably assured. The Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight line basis over a 67 year term. The ground lease is accounted for as an operating lease with
rental expense of $16 million, $19 million and $13 million recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rent recognized for the ground
lease was included in "Preopening and start-up expenses" prior to opening .

Borgata
property
tax
reimbursement
agreement.
On February 15, 2017, Borgata, the Department of Community Affairs of the State of New Jersey and Atlantic
City entered into an agreement wherein Borgata will be reimbursed $72 million as settlement for property tax refunds subject to certain terms and conditions. The payment
of the settlement amount is in satisfaction of existing New Jersey Tax Court and Superior Court judgments totaling approximately $106 million, plus interest for the 2009-
2012 tax years and the settlement of pending tax appeals for the tax years 2013-2015. Those pending tax appeals could potentially have resulted in Borgata being awarded
additional  refunds  due  amounting  to  approximately  $65  million.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Atlantic  City  will  pay  Borgata  the  reimbursement  amount  of  $72
million in up to two installments, with the first installment of $52 million due on or before July 31, 2017 and the second installment for the remaining balance of $20
million due on or before October 1, 2017. In order to finance the reimbursement, Atlantic City and the State of New Jersey have agreed to use their best efforts to issue and
sell bonds to pay the reimbursement. Should Atlantic City fail to pay either of the installment payments or petition for relief from creditors under state or federal law, or
should any other event occur that would cause termination of the agreement, Borgata will be entitled to enforce a consent judgment that is being entered into as part of the
settlement for the 2009-2015 tax years in an amount totaling $158 million.

As part of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay Boyd Gaming half of any net amount received by the Company as it relates to the property
tax refund owed to Borgata. The Company will recognize the amounts received pursuant to the reimbursement agreement and amounts paid to Boyd Gaming in current
earnings in the periods in which payments are received and paid.

NV
Energy.
In July 2016, the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchase energy, capacity, and/or ancillary
services from a provider other than NV Energy. The Company elected to pay the upfront impact payment of $83 million, including $14 million related to CityCenter. The
upfront payments were made in September 2016. The Company and CityCenter are required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy for non-bypassable rate charges
which primarily relate to each entity’s share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extend through 2040 and each entity’s share of the costs of
decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. As of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an estimate of such liability on a discounted
basis of $8 million in “Other accrued liabilities” and $63 million in “Other long-term obligations.” The expense recognized related to the upfront payment and the initial
accrual  for  the  non-bypassable  charges  liability  has  been  recognized  within  “NV  Energy  exit  expense”  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.
Subsequent accretion of the liability and changes in estimates will be recognized within general and administrative expenses.

Grand
Paradise
Macau
deferred
cash
payment.
On September 1, 2016, the Company purchased 188.1 million common shares of its MGM China subsidiary
from Grand Paradise Macau (“GPM”), an entity controlled by Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms. Ho”). As part of the consideration for the purchase, the Company
agreed to pay GPM a deferred cash payment of $50 million, which will be paid in amounts equal to the ordinary dividends received on such shares, with a final lump sum
payment due on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction if any portion of the deferred cash payment remains unpaid at that time. As of December 31,
2016, the Company recorded a liability on a discounted basis of $43 million in “Other long-term obligations.”

Cotai
land
concession
contract.
MGM Grand Paradise’s land concession contract for an approximate 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau became effective on
January 9, 2013 and has an initial  term  of 25 years. The total land premium  payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract  is $161 million and is
composed  of  a  down  payment  and  eight  additional  semi-annual  payments.  As  of  December  31,  2016,  MGM  China  had  paid  $159  million  of  the  contract’s  premium,
including interest due on the semi-annual installments, and the amount paid is recorded within “Other long-term assets, net.” In January 2017, MGM China paid

99

the final semi-annual installment of $15 million under the contract . Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to build and open
MGM Cotai by January 2018.

T-Mobile
Arena.
In conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company entering a senior secured credit facility in 2014, the Company and AEG each entered joint
and  several  completion  guarantees  for  the  project,  as  well  as  a  repayment  guarantee  for  term  loan  B  (which  is  subject  to  increases  and  decreases  in  the  event  of  a
rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities). As of December 31, 2016, term loan A was $150 million and term
loan B was $50 million. The completion guarantees were terminated in February 2017.

Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issued
by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $250 million, MGP’s senior credit facility limits
the amount to $75 million, MGM China’s credit facility limits the amount to $100 million, and MGM National Harbor’s credit facility limits the amount to $30 million. At
December 31, 2016, the Company had $15 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Company’s senior credit facility and $39 million in letters of credit outstanding
under MGM China’s credit  facility.  No amounts were outstanding under the MGP senior credit  facility  and the MGM National Harbor credit  facility  at December  31,
2016. The amount of available borrowings under each of the credit facilities is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.

Other
litigation.
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not

believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

IPO.
The Company adjusted the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests to reflect MGP’s Class A shareholders’ 26.7% initial
ownership interest in the consolidated net assets of MGP related to the IPO and related transactions discussed in Note 1, with an offsetting adjustment to additional paid in
capital.

Borgata
transaction.
The Company has adjusted the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests as a result of the Borgata transaction to adjust for the change in

common
stock
acquisition.
In September 2016, the Company acquired 188.1 million ordinary shares of MGM China from GPM. As a result of the

transaction.  As  consideration  for  the  MGM  China  shares,  the  Company  issued  7,060,492  shares  of  its  common  stock  and  paid  $100  million  to  GPM.  In  addition,  the
Company agreed to pay GPM a deferred cash payment of $50 million. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the deferred cash payment. The Company adjusted
the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and accumulated other comprehensive income to reflect the change in MGM China’s noncontrolling ownership interest
resulting  from  the  transaction.  The  difference  between  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  paid  and  the  aforementioned  adjustments  was  recognized  as  a  reduction  to
additional paid in capital.

MGM
Resorts
2005
Omnibus
Incentive
Plan.
The Company’s omnibus incentive plan, as amended (the “Omnibus Plan”), allows it to grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”) and other stock-based awards to eligible directors, officers and employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Omnibus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors. The Committee has
discretion under the Omnibus Plan regarding which type of awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise price and other conditions, in all cases subject
to certain limits, including:

•
•

As amended, the Omnibus Plan allows for the issuance of up to 45 million shares or share-based awards; and
For stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the maximum
term of such an award is 10 years.

SARs granted under the Omnibus Plan generally have terms of seven years, and in most cases vest in four equal annual installments. RSUs granted vest ratably
over  four  years,  a  portion  of  which  are  subject  to  achievement  of  a  performance  target  based  on  operational  results  compared  to  budget  in  order  for  such  RSUs  to  be
eligible  to  vest.  Expense  is  recognized  primarily  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards,  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  Estimated  forfeitures  are
updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

PSUs granted vest subject to a market condition, in which a percentage of the target award granted vests based on the performance of the Company’s stock price in
relation to the target price at the end of a three year performance period. Specifically, the ending average stock price must equal the target price, which is defined as 125%
of the beginning average stock price, in order for the target award to vest. No shares are issued unless the ending average stock price is at least 60% of the target price, and
the maximum payout is capped at 160% of the target award. If the ending average stock price is at least 60% or more of the target price, then the amount of units granted
in the target award is multiplied by the stock performance multiplier. The stock performance multiplier equals the ending average stock price divided by the target price.
For this purpose, the target and ending prices are based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 60 calendar day periods ending on the grant
date  and  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date,  respectively.  Expense  is  recognized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  performance  period  beginning  on  the  date  of  grant.
Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

101

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of approximately 21 million shares of common stock available for grant as share-based awards under the

Omnibus Plan. A summary of activity under the Company’s share-based payment plans for the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented below:

The Company grants PSUs for a portion of any calculated bonus for a Section 16 officer of the Company that is in excess of such officer’s base salary (the “Bonus
PSU Policy”). Awards granted under the Bonus PSU Policy have the same terms as the other PSUs granted under the Omnibus Plan with the exception that as of the grant
date the awards will not be subject to forfeiture in the event of the officer’s termination. In March 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company granted 0.3 million, 0.2 million and
0.3 million PSUs pursuant to the Bonus PSU Policy with a target price of $23.87, $25.91 and $31.72, respectively. Additionally, the Company granted PSUs for certain
employees of the Company in connection with the Profit Growth Plan (“Profit  Growth Plan PSUs”). Profit Growth Plan PSUs have the same terms as the other PSUs
granted under the Omnibus Plan with the exception of an additional service and performance condition tied to the results of the Profit Growth Plan which must be achieved
for  the  awards  to  vest.  In  October  2015,  the  Company  granted  0.3  million  Profit  Growth  Plan  PSUs  with  a  target  price  of  $25.76.  As  of  December  31,  2016,  the
performance condition associated with the Profit Growth Plan PSUs has been met. Awards granted under the Bonus PSU Policy and in connection with the Profit Growth
Plan are excluded from the table above.

2016
Omnibus
Incentive
Plan.
 The  Company’s  subsidiary,  MGP,  adopted  an  omnibus  incentive  plan  in  2016  for  grants  of  share-
based awards to eligible directors, officers and employees of MGP and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the Company (“MGP Omnibus Plan”). The MGP Omnibus
Plan is administered by MGP’s Board of Directors, which has the discretion to determine the type of awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise price
and other conditions, in all cases subject to certain limits, including:

•
•

The MGP Omnibus Plan allows for the issuance of up to 2.5 million shares; and
Limits the maximum amount of shares to be granted, in the aggregate, to any individual participant within any fiscal year as well as limits the maximum
aggregate grant date value (regardless of type(s) of award granted) in any fiscal year to any non-employee director of MGP.

The  majority  of  RSUs  granted  under  the  MGP  Omnibus  Plan  vest  ratably  over  four  years  with  the  exception  of  RSUs  issued  to  MGM  Resorts  International
employees  in  connection  with  the  IPO,  which  vest  ratably  over  one  year.  Expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards,  net  of
estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. The RSUs are
granted together with dividend equivalent rights that are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the underlying RSUs.

Outstanding  PSUs granted  under  the  MGP Omnibus  Plan  vest  subject  to  a  market  condition,  in  which  a  percentage  of  the  target  award  granted  vests  based  on
MGP’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to a select group of peer companies at the end of a three year performance period. Depending on MGP’s relative TSR at
the end of the performance period, anywhere from 0% to 160% of the target award may vest. Should MGP’s TSR be negative during the performance period, then the
maximum portion of the target award eligible for vesting is capped at 100%. Expense is recognized on a graded basis over the performance period beginning on the date of
grant. Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate. The PSUs are granted together
with dividend equivalent rights that are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture terms as the underlying PSUs.

As of December 31, 2016, MGP had an aggregate of 2 million shares of common stock available for grant as share-based awards under the MGP Omnibus Plan. A

MGM
China
Share
Option
Plan.
The Company’s subsidiary, MGM China, adopted an equity award plan in 2011 for grants of stock options to purchase ordinary
shares  of  MGM  China  to  eligible  directors,  employees  and  non-employees  of  MGM  China  and  its  subsidiaries  (“MGM  China  Plan”).  The  MGM  China  Plan  is
administered by MGM China’s Board of Directors, which has the discretion to determine the exercise price and term of the award, as well as other conditions, in all cases
subject to certain limits, including:

•

•

The maximum number of shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options to be granted under the MGM China Plan shall not in aggregate exceed
10% of the total number of shares in issue as of the date of the shareholders’ approval of the MGM China Plan; and
The exercise price of the award must be the higher of the closing price of the stock on the offer date, or the average of the closing price for the five business
days immediately preceding the offer date, and the maximum term of the award must not exceed ten years.

Stock  options  currently  granted  under  the  MGM  China  Plan  have  a  term  of  ten  years,  and  vest  in  four  equal  annual  installments.  Expense  is  recognized  on  a
straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.  Estimated  forfeitures  are  updated  periodically  with  actual  forfeitures  recognized
currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

As of December 31, 2016, MGM China had an aggregate of approximately 302 million shares of options available for grant as share-based awards. A summary of

activity under the MGM China Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented below:

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT
PLANS

Multi-employer
benefit
plans.
 Employees  of  the  Company  who  are  members  of  various  unions  are  covered  by  union-sponsored,  collectively  bargained,
multiemployer health and welfare and defined benefit pension plans. Of these plans, the Company considers the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Plan
(the “Pension Plan”), under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas for and on behalf of Culinary Workers Union
Local No. 226 and Bartenders Union Local No. 165, to be individually significant. The risk of participating in the Pension Plan differs from single-employer plans in the
following aspects:

a)
b)
c)

d)

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;
If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers;
If  an  entity  chooses  to  stop  participating  in  some  of  its  multiemployer  plans,  the  entity  may  be  required  to  pay  those  plans  an  amount  based  on  the
underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability; and
If the Pension Plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liability
payments, employers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference.

Pursuant to its collective  bargaining agreements referenced  above, the Company also contributes to UNITE HERE Health (the “Health Fund”), which provides

healthcare benefits to its active and retired members. The Company’s participation in the Pension Plan is outlined in the table below.

In 2014, the trustees of the Pension Plan elected to apply the extended amortization and the special ten-year asset smoothing rules under the Pension Relief
Act of 2010.
The Company is party to ten collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the Pension Plan. The agreements between CityCenter Hotel
Casino, LLC, Bellagio, Mandalay Corp., MGM Grand Hotel, LLC and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas are the most significant because more
than half of the Company’s employee participants in the Pension Plan are covered by those four agreements.

Pension Plan contributions in 2016 increased when compared to 2015 due to the contribution rate to the Pension Plan increasing in mid-2016 as defined under the
collective bargaining agreements, which was partially offset by a 3% decrease in hours worked in 2016 compared to 2015. During 2014 an amendment to the collective
bargaining agreements to temporarily divert contributions from the Pension Plan to the Health Fund was in effect. As a result, contributions to the Pension Plan increased
in 2015 compared to 2014 as the amendment ended in June of 2014. Bellagio, Aria, Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas were listed in the Pension Plan’s Forms
5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. At the date the financial statements were issued, Form
5500 was not available for the plan year ending in 2016. No surcharges were imposed on the Company’s contributions to any of the plans.

Borgata.
 The  above  disclosures  exclude  multi-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans  under  terms  of  collective-bargaining  agreements  that  cover  union-
represented employees at Borgata (acquired on August 1, 2016). These unions cover certain of its culinary, hotel and other trade workers. Borgata is obligated to make
defined contributions  under these plans and is also subject to the risks outlined  above for the Company’s other multi-employer  pension plans. Contributions,  based on
wages paid to covered employees, totaled $4 million, for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2016. Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the
National Retirement Fund, Former HEREIU and Local 54 (the “The Local 54 Pension Plan”), which has been listed in “critical status” (which means it is generally less
than 65% funded) and a rehabilitation plan has been adopted. As a result, the Company is responsible for the payment of surcharges in addition to the contribution rate
specified in the collective bargaining agreement. The Company estimates Borgata’s share of unfunded vested liabilities related to certain multi-employer pension plans is
approximately  $288  million  as  of  January  1,  2016,  which  amount  primarily  relates  to  The  Local  54  Pension  Plan,  and  which  amount  is  subject  to  change  each  year
depending on the applicable plan ’ s employer contributions, investment performance and other factors. Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans,
which withdrawal could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary
based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal.

Self-insurance.
The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability for health care
claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported was $30 million and $22 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The workers compensation
liability for claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported was $53 million and $43 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Both liabilities
are included in “Other accrued liabilities.”

Retirement
savings
plans.
 The  Company  has  retirement  savings  plans  under  Section  401(k)  of  the  IRC for  eligible  employees.  The  plans  allow  employees  to
defer, within prescribed limits, up to 75% of their income on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis through contributions to the plans. The Company matches 50% of the first 6%
of eligible employee deferrals up to a specified annual maximum dollar amount. The Company recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of $20 million, $16 million and
$17 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of
their salary and bonus and accumulate  tax deferred  earnings,  plus investment  earnings  on the deferred  balances,  as a deferred  tax savings. All employee  deferrals  vest
immediately. The Company does not contribute to the plan.

The  Company  also  maintains  nonqualified  supplemental  executive  retirement  plans  (“SERP”)  for  certain  key  employees.  Until  September  2008,  the  Company
made quarterly contributions intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year average annual salary, up to a
maximum  of  65%.  The  Company  has  indefinitely  suspended  these  contributions.  Employees  do  not  make  contributions  under  these  plans.  A  portion  of  the  Company
contributions and investment

earn ings  thereon  vest  after  three  years  of  SERP  participation  and  the  remaining  portion  vests  after  both  five  years  of  SERP  participation  and  10  years  of  continuous
service.

MGM
China.
 MGM  China  contributes  to  a  retirement  plan  as  part  of  an  employee  benefits  package  for  eligible  employees.  The  Company  recorded  charges

related to contributions in the retirement plan of $7 million, $7 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The  Company’s  management  views  each  of  its  casino  resorts  as  an  operating  segment.  Operating  segments  are  aggregated  based  on  their  similar  economic
characteristics,  types  of  customers,  types  of  services  and  products  provided,  the  regulatory  environments  in  which  they  operate,  and  their  management  and  reporting
structure. The Company’s principal operating activities occur in two geographic regions: the United States and Macau S.A.R. The Company has aggregated its operations
into  two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments:  domestic  resorts  and  MGM  China.  The  Company’s  operations  related  to
investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  certain  other  corporate  operations  and  management  services  have  not  been  identified  as  separate  reportable  segments;
therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

The  Company’s  management  utilizes  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  as  the  primary  profit  measure  for  its  reportable  segments.  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  is  a
measure defined as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the Omnibus Plan and the MGP Omnibus Plan, which are not
allocated to the reportable segments or each operating segment, as applicable. MGM China recognizes stock compensation expense related to the MGM China Plan which
is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income
(expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges,
and property transactions, net.

MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd. (together with its subsidiary MGM Development Services, Ltd., “MGM Branding and Development”), an entity
included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in which Ms. Ho indirectly holds a noncontrolling interest, is party to a brand license agreement with MGM
China. MGM China pays a license fee to MGM Branding and Development equal to 1.75% of MGM Macau’s consolidated net revenue, subject to an annual cap of $62
million in 2016 with a

110

20% increase per annum for each subsequent calendar year during the term of the agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, MGM China
incurred total license fees of $34 million, $39 million and $43 million, respectively. Such amounts have been elimi nated in consolidation.

MGM  China  is  party  to  a  development  services  agreement  with  MGM  Branding  and  Development  to  provide  certain  development  services  to  MGM  China  in
connection with future expansion of existing projects and development of future resort gaming projects. Such services are subject to a development fee which is calculated
separately for each casino resort property upon commencement of development. For each such property, the fee is 2.625% of project costs, to be paid in installments as
certain benchmarks are achieved. Project costs are the total costs incurred for the design, development and construction of the casino, casino hotel, integrated resort and
other  related  sites  associated  with  each  project,  including  costs  of  construction,  fixtures  and  fittings,  signage,  gaming  and  other  supplies  and  equipment  and  all  costs
associated with the opening of the business to be conducted at each project but excluding the cost of land and gaming concessions and financing costs. The development
fee  is  subject  to  an  annual  cap  of  $29  million  in  2016,  which  will  increase  by  10%  per  annum  for  each  year  during  the  term  of  the  agreement.  For  the  years  ended
December  31,  2016  and  2015,  MGM  China  incurred  $12  million  and  $10  million  of  fees,  respectively,  to  MGM  Branding  and  Development  related  to  development
services. Such amount is eliminated in consolidation. No fee was paid for the year ended December 31, 2014.

An  entity  owned  by  Ms.  Ho  received  distributions  of  $15  million,  $15  million  and  $13  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2016,  2015  and  2014,

respectively, in connection with the ownership of a noncontrolling interest in MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd.

MGP

Pursuant to a master lease agreement by and between a subsidiary of the Company (the “Tenant”) and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “Landlord”),
the Tenant has leased the contributed real estate assets from the Landlord. The master lease has an initial lease term of ten years with the potential to extend the term for
four additional five-year terms thereafter at the option of the Tenant. The master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estate under the
master  lease  at the time of the extension. The master  lease  has a triple-net  structure,  which requires  the Tenant  to pay substantially  all costs associated  with the lease,
including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides the Landlord with a right of
first offer with respect to MGM National Harbor and the Company’s development property located in Springfield, Massachusetts, which the Landlord may exercise should
the Company elect to sell these properties in the future.

Subsequent to the Company completing its acquisition of Borgata on August 1, 2016, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of the Company in
exchange  for  MGP’s  assumption  of  $545  million  of  indebtedness  and  the  issuance  of  27.4  million  Operating  Partnership  units  to  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company.  In
connection with this transaction, the Tenant and Landlord entered into an amendment to the master lease to include the Borgata real property.

The annual rent payments due under the master lease were $550 million prior to MGP’s acquisition of Borgata’s real property on August 1, 2016. Subsequent to
the acquisition, annual rent payments under the master lease increased to $650 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata transaction. Rent
under the master lease consists of a “base rent” component and a “percentage rent” component. For the first year, the base rent will represent 90% of the initial total rent
payments due under the master lease and the percentage rent will represent 10% of the initial total rent payments due under the master lease. The base rent includes a fixed
annual rent escalator of 2.0% for the second through the sixth lease years (as defined in the master lease). Thereafter, the annual escalator of 2.0% will be subject to the
Tenant and, without duplication, the operating subsidiary sublessees of the Tenant, collectively meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio of 6.25:1.00 based on their net
revenue from the leased properties subject to the master lease (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, adjusted to exclude net revenue
attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Company’s option, reimbursed cost revenue). The percentage rent will initially be a fixed amount for approximately
the  first  six  years  and  will  then  be  adjusted  every  five  years  based  on  the  average  actual  annual  net  revenues  of  the  Tenant  and,  without  duplication,  the  operating
subsidiary sublessees of the Tenant, from the leased properties subject to the master lease at such time for the trailing five calendar-year period (calculated by multiplying
the average annual net revenues, excluding net revenue attributable to certain scheduled subleases and, at the Landlord’s option, reimbursed cost revenue, for the trailing
five calendar-year period by 1.4%). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made rent payments to the Landlord in the amount of $418 million.

Pursuant to the master lease, upon an event of default the Landlord may, at its option (i) terminate the master lease, repossess any leased property, relet any leased
property to a third party and require that the Tenant pay damages; (ii) require that the Tenant pay to the Landlord rent and other sums payable with interest calculated at
the overdue rate provided for in the master lease or terminate the Tenant’s right to possession of the leased property and seek damages; and/or (iii) seek any and all other
rights and remedies

111

available under law or in equity. An event of default will b e deemed to occur upon certain events, including: (1) the failure by the Tenant to pay rent or other additional
charges when due; (2) failure by the Tenant to comply with the covenants set forth in the master lease; (3) certain events of bankruptcy or inso lvency with respect to a
Tenant or the guarantor; (4) the occurrence of a default under the guaranty of the master lease; (5) the loss or suspension of a material license that causes cessation of
gaming activity that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Tenant, the facilities  or the leased properties taken as a whole; and (6) the
failure  of  the  Company,  on  a  consolidated  basis  with  Tenant,  to  maintain  an  EBITDAR  to  rent  ratio  (as  described  in  the  master  lease)  of  at  least  1.  10:1.00  for  two
consecutive test periods, beginning with the test periods ending December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as
of December 31, 2016.

Pursuant  to  a  corporate  services  agreement,  the  Company  provides  MGP  and  its  subsidiaries  with  financial,  administrative  and  operational  support  services,
including  accounting  and  finance  support,  human  resources  support,  legal  and  regulatory  compliance  support,  insurance  advisory  services,  internal  audit  services,
governmental  affairs  monitoring  and  reporting  services,  information  technology  support,  construction  services,  and  various  other  support  services.  The  Company  is
reimbursed for all costs it incurs directly related to providing the services thereunder.

All  intercompany  transactions,  including  transactions  under  the  corporate  services  agreement  and  master  lease,  have  been  eliminated  in  the  Company’s

consolidation of MGP. The public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized as non-controlling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

T-Mobile
Arena

The Las Vegas Arena Company leases the land underlying the T-Mobile Arena from the Company under a 50 year operating lease, which commenced upon the
opening  of  the  Arena.  In  conjunction  with  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company  obtaining  financing  and  beginning  construction  in  2014,  the  Company  began  accruing  rental
income. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded income of $3 million, $3 million and $1 million, respectively, for the T-Mobile
Arena ground lease. The Company leases the MGM Grand Garden Arena to Las Vegas Arena Company. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded
income of $2 million.

CONSOLIDATING
CONDENSED
FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

As of December 31, 2016, all of the Company’s principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of its material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGP and the
Operating  Partnership,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  LLC,  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  Blue  Tarp  reDevelopment,  LLC  (the  company  that  will  own  and  operate  the
Company’s proposed casino in Springfield, Massachusetts), and each of their respective subsidiaries. The Company’s international subsidiaries, including MGM China
and its subsidiaries, are not guarantors of such indebtedness. Separate condensed financial statement information for the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, are presented below. Within the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash
Flows  for  the  periods  ending  December  31,  2016 and  2015,  the  Company  has  presented  net  changes  in  intercompany  accounts  as  investing  activities  if  the  applicable
entities have a net asset in intercompany accounts and as a financing activity if the applicable entities have a net intercompany liability balance.

Certain  of  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  (“OPCOs”)  collectively  own  76.3%  of  the  Operating  Partnership  units  as  of  December  31,  2016,  and  each  subsidiary
accounts  for  its  respective  investment  under  the  equity  method  within  the  condensed  consolidating  financial  information  presented  below.  At  these  subsidiaries,  such
investment constitutes continuing involvement, and accordingly, the contribution and leaseback of the real estate assets do not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. The
real  estate  assets  that  were  contributed  to  and  owned by the  Operating  Partnership  in  connection  with  the IPO, along  with  the  related  transactions,  are  reflected  in  the
balance  sheets  of  the  MGM  subsidiaries  that  contributed  such  assets.  In  addition,  such  subsidiaries  recognized  finance  liabilities  within  “Other  long-term  obligations”
related to rent payments due under the Master Lease and recognized the related interest expense component of such payments. These real estate assets are also reflected on
the balance sheet of the MGP subsidiary that received such assets in connection with the contribution. The condensed consolidating financial information presented below
therefore includes the accounting for such activity within the respective columns presented and in the elimination column. For all periods prior to the commencement of
the Master Lease arrangement, the condensed consolidating financial information set forth herein has been retrospectively adjusted to conform prior periods to the current
presentation,  as  the  transactions  occurred  between  entities,  which  are  considered  businesses  under  common  control.  Accordingly,  the  real  estate  assets  and  associated
operations in all periods prior to the IPO date were reclassified to conform to the current organizational structure, and are reflected in the MGP subsidiary that currently
has legal title to such assets.

Beltway  Parcel  outside  the  Premises  be  used  for  any  of  the  prohibited  uses  described  in  Section  7.1(e)  of  the  Amended,  Restated  and
Replaced National Harbor Community Declaration, recorded in the land records of Prince George's County, Maryland on October 25, 2006

the date hereof, other than (i) car washes as part of a service station, (ii) a single gourmet or specialty grocery store, and (iii) auto specialty
stores or boutiques. Landlord shall, or shall cause the declarant or founder under the National Harbor Declaration, to grant Tenant the non-
exclusive right to enforce the terms of the National Harbor Declaration against other owners or occupants who violate the prohibited uses

resubmit  such  Review  Materials  to  Landlord  for  Landlord’s  review  and  approval  as  provided  herein.    Landlord  and  Tenant  shall  work

(f)  Use  of  Premises  Prior  to  Construction  .    The  parties  agree  that  prior  to  the  Tenant  commencing  construction  of  the
Tenant  Improvements,  Landlord,  its  Affiliates,  employees,  agents,  guests  and  invitees  shall  have  the  right  to  utilize  the  Premises  for
parking and other temporary uses.  In no event shall such use involve constructing any permanent improvements upon the Premises, or any
other improvements whether permanent or temporary in nature, or performing any alterations to the existing condition of the Premises, in
each  case  which  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  impair  the  condition  of  the  Premises  and/or  Tenant’s  ability  to  construct  the  Hotel  &
Casino thereon as a result thereof; provided, however, that erecting tents on the Premises shall not constitute a violation of this Section
3.01(f). Landlord covenants and agrees to promptly notify Tenant of any temporary uses (other than parking) for which Landlord desires to
utilize the Premises. Tenant agrees to provide Landlord sixty (60) days advance written notice prior to the commencement of construction
at which time Landlord shall no longer permit such parties to utilize the Premises for parking or such other temporary uses.  Landlord shall
indemnify  and  save  the  Tenant,  harmless  against  and  from  all  liabilities,  obligations,  damages,  penalties,  claims,  costs,  charges  and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ and other consultants’ fees, which may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by or asserted
against the Tenant by reason of the use of the Premises for parking by Landlord, its Affiliates, employees, agents, guests and invitees in
accordance with the terms of this Section 3.01(f), except to the extent resulting from Tenant’s negligence or willful misconduct.

(g)  Licenses  and  Permits  .    Tenant  shall  diligently  pursue  all  approvals,  licenses  and  permits  required  for  Tenant  to
complete the Tenant Improvements in accordance with the terms of this Lease and with applicable law.  Tenant shall provide to Landlord,
for Landlord’s review, Tenant’s preliminary proposed response to the RFP for issuance of the Gaming License on or before the date which
is twenty (20) days prior to the date the RFP response is due for submission.  The sole purpose of Landlord’s review of the RFP response
shall  be  to  provide  input  as  to  anything  in  the  response  that  Landlord  believes  would  better  position  Tenant's  response  to  the  RFP  for
success based on its local experience, to confirm factual data or information about the Premises, the Beltway Parcel or Landlord, and to
confirm that nothing set forth therein shall violate the terms of this Lease and not adversely affect the obligations of the Landlord or the
Premises, and such review shall not constitute an approval right with respect to the RFP response.  Tenant shall submit the approved RFP
to the appropriate  authority  on or before the final response date set forth in the RFP.  Tenant shall keep Landlord informed of the RFP
process  and  shall  provide  copies  of  all  substantive  and  material  correspondence  sent  or  received  regarding  the  RFP,  excluding  any
correspondence involving personal or confidential information with regard to the Tenant and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates or their
officers, directors or principals.  Tenant covenants to diligently pursue the issuance of the Gaming License and to promptly respond to any
inquiries  or  questions  relating  to  the  RFP.    It  is  understood  that  agencies  of  the  State  of  Maryland  (the  "  State  ")  will  conduct  a
comprehensive  confidential  investigation  of Tenant  and related  parties  in connection  with its application  for the Gaming  License  which
will  include  numerous  meetings,  interviews,  inspections  and  telephone  calls.    Tenant  covenants  to  promptly  provide  reasonable  and
customary  cooperation  with  respect  to  requests  from  appropriate  State  officials  in  connection  with  its  application  for  the  Gaming
License.  To the extent practicable, and to the extent that State officials agree to permit such participation, Tenant shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to notify Landlord, in writing when possible, of any planned visits to the Premises in connection with the investigation

visits.  Tenant shall provide Landlord with periodic written reports, not less frequently than monthly, generally describing the status of the
State's investigation and identifying issues raised by the State that are of significant concern and could jeopardize Tenant's standing to be
found suitable to be awarded the Gaming License.  Should Tenant learn of any material concern raised by State officials which is likely to
lead to an objection to a finding of suitability of Tenant or the Premises to receive the Gaming License, Tenant shall notify Landlord of this
occurrence within forty-eight (48) hours of discovery and shall reasonably apprise Landlord of the facts and circumstances related to any
such issue.  Upon written request from Landlord for a meeting with appropriate State officials, Tenant shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to  facilitate  a  meeting  between  Landlord  and  the  appropriate  State  officials  to  permit  them  to  discuss  the  issues  concerning  the
State's investigation of Tenant and related parties and the potential impact areas of concern on Tenant's suitability.  All reports, written or
verbal,  provided  by  Tenant  to  Landlord  and  meetings  facilitated  by  Tenant  concerning  this  investigation  process  shall  be  held  strictly
confidential by Landlord and be afforded all protections afforded to confidential information pursuant to Section 18.22 herein.

satisfactory to the Landlord to assure payment of contested items (unless Tenant provides evidence to Landlord that Tenant has provided
payment or other security to the court in connection with such proceedings, in which event no security shall be provided to Landlord);

(b)

Tenant  shall  immediately  pay  such  contested  item  or  items  if  the  protection  of  the  Premises  or  of  the  Landlord’s
interest therein from any lien or claim shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Landlord, require such payment (unless Tenant provides

contested items;

(b)  Tenant  shall  immediately  pay  such  contested  item  or  items  if  required  in  order  to  proceed  with  such  contest  or  if  the

require such payment; and

(c)  The  Landlord  shall  not  be  required  to  join  in  any  proceedings  referred  to  herein  unless  the  provisions  of  any  law,  rule
or regulation at the time in effect shall require that such proceedings be brought by or in the name of the Landlord.  The Landlord shall not
be  subjected  to  any  liability  for  the  payment  of  any  costs  or  expenses  in  connection  with  any  such  proceedings,  and  Tenant  shall
indemnify, defend and save harmless the Landlord from any such costs and expenses.

Subject to the foregoing, and without cost to it, the Landlord shall execute and deliver any appropriate papers which may be necessary to

Impositions to become due with respect to the Premises between one (1) and thirteen (13) months after the date of such deposit; provided
that  in  the  case  of  the  first  such  deposit,  Tenant  shall  deposit  in  addition,  an  amount  which,  when  added  to  the  aggregate  amount  of
monthly deposits to be made here under with respect to Impositions to become due within thirteen (13) months after such first deposit, will
provide (without interest) sufficient funds to pay such Impositions, one (1) month prior to the date when they are due.  The amounts of
such  deposits  (herein  generally  called  "  Imposition  Deposits  ")  shall  be  based  upon  Landlord's  estimate  of  the  amount  of
Impositions.  Tenant shall promptly upon the demand of Landlord make additional Imposition Deposits as Landlord, or Landlord’s lender
may from time to time require due to (i) failure of Tenant to make, Imposition Deposits in previous months, (ii) underestimation of the
amounts of Impositions, due dates and amounts of Imposition, or (iii) application of the Imposition Deposits pursuant to Section 5.04(c).

(b)  Landlord  shall,  out  of  the  Imposition  Deposits,  upon  receipt  by  Landlord  of  the  bills  therefor,  pay  the  Impositions  or
shall  upon  the  presentation  of  receipted  bills  therefor,  reimburse  Tenant  for  such  payments  made  by  Tenant.    If  the  total  Imposition
Deposits on hand shall not be sufficient to pay all of the Impositions when the same shall become due, then Tenant shall immediately pay
to Landlord on demand the amount necessary to make up the deficiency.

(c)  Upon  an  Event  of  Default,  Landlord  may,  at  its  option,  apply  any  Imposition  Deposits  on  hand  to  the  obligations
under  this  Lease.    All  Imposition  Deposits  are  hereby  pledged  as  additional  security  for  the  Lease,  and  shall  be  held  by  Landlord
irrevocably to be

subrogation is contained in this Lease, and each party shall endeavor to cause each such insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the
insurance  company  waives  all  right  of  recovery  by  way  of  subrogation  against  either  the  Landlord  or  Tenant  in  connection  with  any

either Landlord or Tenant violates the restriction set forth in Section 8.03(a) and that money damages would be inadequate to compensate
the non-breaching party for such harm.  Consequently, the parties agree that the non-breaching party, in addition to all of its rights and
remedies contained herein, shall have the right to apply for, seek and demand injunctive relief to compel the cure of such violation.

the  operation,  maintenance  and  management  of,  the  Hotel  &  Casino  as  a  first-class  hotel  and  casino  in  accordance  with  the  Brand
Standards and the terms and provisions of this Lease.  As used herein, the term “ Brand Standards ” shall mean the standards in effect from
time to time of (a) design, construction, furnishing, equipping, maintenance and repairing of the Hotel & Casino, and (b) operating, guest
service  and  marketing  of  the  Hotel  &  Casino,  all  of  which  shall  be:  (i)  at  the  first-class  standard  established  from  time  to  time  by  the
Guarantor for the MGM brand (the “ Brand ”), but in no event shall such standard be of lesser quality than the greater of quality of the
MGM Grand Detroit as of the Effective Date and the quality of the Hotel & Casino as of Final Completion; and (ii) in accordance with
policies, procedures, instructions, specifications, manuals and programs in effect from time to time which are applicable to the operation of

agree on a replacement facility for the standard. The Brand Standards include any one or more (as the context requires) of the following
three  categories  of  standards:    (A)  operational  standards  (e.g.,  services  offered  to  guests,  quality  of  food  and  beverages,  cleanliness,
staffing and employee compensation and benefits, centralized services, frequent traveler programs and other similar programs, etc.); (B)
physical  standards  (e.g.,  quality  of  the  improvements,  FF&E  and  supplies,  frequency  of  FF&E  replacements)  and  fire  and  life  safety
standards;  and  (C)  technology  standards  (e.g.,  those  relating  to  software,  hardware,  telecommunications,  high  speed  internet  access,
systems  security  and  information  technology).    Tenant  has  granted  to  Landlord  prior  to  the  Effective  Date  hereof  access  to  an  internet
portal containing the Brand Standards, and shall provide such access to Landlord throughout the Term hereof.

(b)  Application  of  Operation,  Maintenance  and  Management  Standards  .    In  the  event  that  the  Landlord  determines  in  its
discretion that the Hotel & Casino are not operating, being maintained or managed in compliance with the standards required in this Lease,
the  Landlord  shall  give  notice  of  its  specific  objection  and  the  requested  correction.    The  parties  shall  negotiate  in  good  faith  on  a
resolution of the objection.  In the event that a resolution satisfactory to the Landlord is not achieved within fifteen (15) days, the Landlord
may elect to refer the issue to the Dispute Resolution Process for determination of whether there has been a failure to operate, maintain or
manage in compliance with the specified standards.

other  property  installed  or  used  in,  on,  or  about  the  Tenant  Improvements  in  excess  of  $100,000,000.00  (subject  to  Section  18.19)  all
insurance money paid on account of such damage or destruction shall be paid to the Trustee to be appointed pursuant to the provisions of
Section 7.09 hereof, less the reasonable cost, if any, incurred in connection with adjustment of the loss and the collection thereof, and shall
be applied by such Trustee to the payment of the cost of the aforesaid restoration, repairs, replacement, rebuilding or alterations, including
the  cost  of  temporary  repairs  for  the  protection  of  property  pending  the  completion  of  permanent  restoration,  repairs,  replacements,

be reasonable, absent a showing by the Landlord or Tenant that such conditions are not generally consistent with the lending requirements
then  customarily  employed  by  major  Maryland  banks  in  similar  loans.    There  shall  be  withheld  from  payments  on  account  of  work
completed and materials furnished such amounts as are then so customarily being withheld in connection with construction of the size and
complexity  of  the  restoration.    All  payments  shall  be  received  by  Tenant  for  the  purposes  of  paying  the  cost  of  such  restoration  upon
receipt by the Trustee of the written request of Tenant accompanied by suitable documentation including the following:

(a)  Satisfactory  evidence  that  the  insurance  proceeds  remaining  to  be  disbursed  are  sufficient  to  pay  all  anticipated  costs
of completing the restoration.  (If at any time prior to or during the course of restoration the insurance proceeds remaining to be disbursed
are not sufficient to pay the entire cost of completing the restoration, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to the Trustee before requesting the
disbursement of additional proceeds from the Trustee);

(b)  Bills  from  contractors  and  subcontractors  for  work  and  materials  in  place,  describing  in  reasonable  detail  such  work

and materials, and bills for the reasonable fees of any lawyer, architect or engineer for services relating to the restoration;

(c)  A  certificate  signed  by  Tenant  stating  that  the  amount  of  each  such  bill  does  not  exceed  the  cost  of  such  work,
materials,  or  services  described  on  such  bill,  and  that  no  part  of  such  cost  has  previously  been  made  the  basis  of  the  withdrawal  of
insurance proceeds;

(d)  A  certificate  of  the  architect  or  engineer  in  charge  of  the  restoration,  or  of  a  third  party  not  in  the  regular  employ  of
any of the parties hereto, which architect, engineer or third party is reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (and against whom the Landlord
has no reasonable objection), stating that (i) the work, materials or services described in the bills were necessary or appropriate and are in
place  or  have  been  performed,  (ii)  the  amount  specified  in  the  bills  does  not  exceed  the  reasonable  cost  of  such  work,  materials,  or
services, (iii) the work or materials described in each bill, to the knowledge of such architect, engineer or third party, has been supplied by
the  contractor  or  subcontractor  submitting  such  bill  or  by  a  person  who  has  supplied  materials  to  such  contractor  or  subcontractor,  and
(iv) to the knowledge of such architect, engineer or third party, the additional amount, if any, is required to complete the restoration;

(e)  A  title  search  by  a  title  company  or  licensed  abstractor  or  other  evidence  satisfactory  to  the  Trustee  that  there  has  not
been filed with respect to Tenant Improvements or the Premises any mechanic’s or other lien or instrument for the retention of title with
respect to any part of the work performed which has not been discharged of record, except liens which will be discharged by payment of
the amount then requested or liens with respect to which Tenant has furnished a satisfactory bond;

(f)  If  applicable,  satisfactory  evidence  that  any  license  or  franchise  agreement  approved  by  the  Landlord  in  accordance
with Section 8.05 remains in full force and effect notwithstanding the damage or destruction, and that the respective licensor or franchisor

(g)  For  any  payment  after  the  restoration  has  been  substantially  completed,  a  copy  of  any  certificate  required  by  law  to

Upon receipt by such Trustee of satisfactory evidence that the restoration has been completed and paid for in full and that there
are  no  liens  of  the  character  referred  to  above,  any  balance  at  the  time  held  by  such  Trustee  shall  be  paid  to  Tenant.    If  this  Lease  is
terminated by the Landlord following an Event of Default by reason of Tenant’s failure to repair or restore as provided in this Lease or for
any  other  reason,  any  balance  at  the  time  held  by  such  Trustee  shall  be  paid  to  the  Landlord  (subject  always  to  the  rights  of  Permitted

FF&E or other property installed or used in, on or about Tenant Improvements, by fire or any other casualty, whether or not insured, shall
permit Tenant to surrender this Lease or shall relieve Tenant from its liability to pay the full Rent and other charges payable under this
Lease or from any of its other obligations under this Lease, and Tenant waives any rights now or hereafter conferred upon it by statute or
otherwise to quit or surrender this Lease or the Premises, or any part thereof, or to any suspension, diminution, abatement or reduction of
rent on account of any such destruction or damage.

Section

casualty to the Tenant  Improvements  shall occur at a time when the remainder  of the then-existing  Term plus any remaining  Extension
Periods (collectively, "Remaining Term"), is equal to or less than (10) Lease Years, and the cost of restoring the Tenant Improvements
shall  exceed  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  the  replacement  cost  of  the  entire  Tenant  Improvements  (or  thirty  percent  during  the  five  (5)  Lease
Years prior to the end of the Remaining Term), then Tenant shall be granted as many additional Extension Periods as may be required to
cause the Remaining  Term to have not fewer than twenty  (20) Lease Years remaining  as of the estimated  date that Tenant's  restoration
work would be complete.  Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of the occurrence of damage or casualty that meets the criteria of this
Section 9.04 within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of the damage or casualty, and the parties shall promptly thereafter enter into an

hereunder.  Each party so participating shall pay its own expenses therein .

Section
10.02
Termination
.  If at any time during the Term of this Lease there shall be a Taking of the whole or substantially
all of the Premises, this Lease shall terminate and expire on the date of such Taking and the Rent hereunder shall be paid to the date of
such Taking.  For the purpose of this Article, “ substantially all of the Premises ” shall be deemed to have been taken if the untaken part of
the Premises shall be insufficient for the restoration of the Hotel & Casino such as to allow the economic and feasible operation thereof by
Tenant.  If there is a Taking resulting in the termination of this Lease as above provided, the rights of the Landlord and Tenant with respect
to the award shall be as follows:

(a)  First,  to  the  payment  of  the  reasonable  costs,  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  Landlord  and  Tenant  in  connection

with the collection of the award;

(b)  Second,  the  Landlord  shall  receive  any  separate  award  made  by  the  Taking  authority  for  the  consequential  damages
to the Landlord  on account  of any diminution  in value  of the portion  of the Land  and  other  adjacent  land  of the Landlord  which  is not
taken;

(c) Third, Tenant shall receive any separate award made by the Taking authority for Tenant’s relocation;

(d)  Fourth,  the  Landlord  shall  receive  an  amount  (the  “  Landlord’s  Award  ”)  equal  to  the  value  of  Landlord’s  interests  in
the Premises taken as burdened and benefited by this Lease, and the Tenant shall receive an amount (the “ Tenant’s Award ”) equal to the
value of the leasehold interest taken as burdened and benefited by this Lease; and if the proceeds are insufficient for both such Awards,
then the proceeds shall be shared in a manner agreed to by Landlord and Tenant that fairly allocates the proceeds to each of them for their
respective  interests  taken.    If  the  parties  cannot  agree  upon  such  allocation,  either  party  may  seek  a  determination  by  a  Mediator  in
accordance with Article XVII; and

(e)  Fifth,  if  the  then  highest  and  best  use  is  other  than  a  Permitted  Use  resulting  in  the  fair  market  value  of  the  Land
taken, considered without regard to the burdens and benefits of the Lease, being greater than the combined value of the Landlord’s Award
and the Tenant’s Award, then such excess in fair market value shall be paid to the Landlord.

No such termination of this Lease under this Section 10.02 shall release Tenant from any obligation hereunder for Rent accrued
or payable for or during any period prior to the effective  date of such termination,  and any prepaid  rent, taxes and insurance  premiums
beyond the effective date of such termination shall be adjusted.

Section
10.03
Restoration
.  In the event of a Taking which does not result in the termination of this Lease pursuant to Section

10.02:

(a) Tenant shall continue to pay all Rent due to Landlord, and there shall be no reduction or abatement of Rent.

(c) The Landlord shall be entitled to the Landlord’s Award.

(d)  Tenant  shall  be  entitled  to  the  Tenant’s  Award  and  all  remaining  proceeds  (the    “  Remaining  Proceeds  ”)  and  shall
apply the same to the cost of restoration required by paragraph (b) hereof (which sum is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “ cost of
restoration ”).  The Tenant’s Award and the Remaining Proceeds shall be paid to Tenant in progress payments as the work progresses in
the same manner as provided in Section 7.09 hereof with respect to the application of insurance proceeds.  If the Tenant’s Award and the
Remaining Proceeds shall be insufficient to defray the cost of restoration, Tenant shall pay any deficiency.

(e)  After  restoration,  any  portion  of  the  Tenant’s  Award  and  the  Remaining  Proceeds  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  restoration
shall be divided between the Landlord and Tenant such that the Tenant receives the remaining portion, if any, of the Tenant’s Award and
Landlord receives the Remaining Proceeds.

Temporary
Taking

Lease  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  Tenant  shall  continue  to  pay  in  full  the  Rent  payable  by  Tenant  hereunder  without  reduction  or
abatement, and Tenant shall be entitled to receive any award so made for the period of the temporary Taking which is within the Term.  If
such  temporary  Taking  shall  extend  beyond  the  expiration  or  earlier  termination  of  this  Lease,  the  Landlord  shall  be  entitled  to  such
portion of such award.

Section
10.05

ARTICLE X.

Section
10.06

Years prior to the end of the Remaining Term), then Tenant shall be granted as many additional Extension Periods as may be required to
cause the Remaining  Term to have not fewer than twenty  (20) Lease Years remaining  as of the estimated  date that Tenant's  restoration
work would be complete.  Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of the occurrence of Taking that meets the criteria of this Section 10.06

Landlord’s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the
Opening Date, Tenant may assign this Lease and its leasehold interests therein without Landlord’s prior written consent provided that (i)
the assignee is a nationally-recognized operator of first class luxury hotels and casinos not less than the level of quality and service as the
Tenant  Improvements  and  Brand  Standards,  and  (ii)  the  assignee  has  sufficient  financial  resources  and  liquidity  to  meet  the  ongoing
financial  obligations  of  the  Tenant  under  this  Lease  and  to  maintain  and  operate  the  Hotel  &  Casino  in  accordance  with  the  Brand
Standards.  Prior to the Opening Date of the Tenant Improvements, Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under the Guaranty in
connection  with  any  assignment,  so  long  as  the  new  tenant  has  financial  resources  and  liquidity  acceptable  to  Landlord  in  its  sole  and
absolute  discretion  or  a  replacement  guarantor  with  financial  resources  and  liquidity  acceptable  to  Landlord  in  its  sole  and  absolute
discretion provides a replacement guaranty acceptable to Landlord.  After the Opening Date of the Tenant Improvements, Guarantor shall
be released from its obligations under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment, so long as the new tenant has financial resources
and  liquidity  acceptable  to  Landlord  in  its  reasonable  discretion  or  a  replacement  guarantor  with  financial  resources  and  liquidity
acceptable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion provides a replacement guaranty acceptable to Landlord.  Tenant may not convert the
Premises  or  any  portion  thereof  to  a  leasehold  condominium  or  a  leasehold  cooperative  timeshare  or  to  any  use  that  is  not  a  Permitted
Use.  In conjunction with any assignment or proposed assignment pursuant to this Section 11.01, Tenant shall provide the Landlord with
banking  and  financial  information  with  respect  to  the  proposed  assignee  reasonably  sufficient  to  enable  the  Landlord  to  determine  the
financial  responsibility  of  the  proposed  assignee  and  such  other  additional  information  as  the  Landlord  shall  reasonably  request  in
connection with its evaluation of the proposed assignee.  In furtherance but not in limitation of the foregoing, it shall be reasonable for the
Landlord to withhold its consent if the proposed assignee is a Disqualified Person or not qualified to obtain/hold the Gaming License.

Upon making an assignment in accordance with this Section 11.01, Tenant shall furnish the Landlord promptly with an executed
copy of the instrument of assignment and with an agreement in proper form for recording, executed by the assignee, in a form approved by
the  Landlord,  in  which  such  assignee  assumes  and  agrees  for  the  benefit  of  the  Landlord,  to  observe  and  perform  all  of  the  covenants,
conditions  and  agreements  in  this  Lease  on  the  part  of  Tenant  to  be  observed  or  performed.    Upon  the  execution  and  delivery  of  such
assumption agreement consistent with the conditions contained herein, Tenant and Guarantor shall be relieved from all further liabilities
and obligations hereunder arising from and after the date of the assignment.

The foregoing provisions concerning assignments and transfers shall apply to voluntary and involuntary and direct and indirect
assignments  and  transfers,  and  to  assignments  and  transfers  by  operation  of  law.    Notwithstanding  the  provisions  contained  in  the  first
paragraph of this Section 11.01, Tenant shall not be required to obtain the consent of the Landlord to an assignment in connection with (i) a
foreclosure  by  a  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  (or  deed  or  assignment  in  lieu  thereof),  including,  without  limitation,  a  purchase  of
Tenant’s interest in a foreclosure sale or from a foreclosing Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee, (ii) a transfer by reason of death or incapacity
of an individual holding an Equity Interest in Tenant, (iii) transfers of the publicly traded stock in Tenant or in any direct or indirect owner
of Tenant, (iv) transfers of any Equity Interest in Tenant provided that not more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the Equity

Interests  in  Tenant  have  been  transferred  in  any  single  or  related  series  of  transactions,  in  the  aggregate,  or  (v)  an  assignment  to  any
Affiliate of Tenant (provided that with respect to this clause (v) the assignor shall not be released and shall remain liable for any breaches
or Events of Default by such Affiliate under this Lease).  Tenant shall provide written notice to the Landlord of any and all changes or
transfers  in  the  holders  of  the  Equity  Interests  in  Tenant  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  such  change  or  transfer,  regardless  of  whether  the
Landlord’s consent is required under this  Section 11.01.

Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section shall be void.

Section
11.02
Subleases
.    Tenant  may  sublet  portions  of  the  Premises  for  hotel-related  business  purposes  including  but  not
limited  to  as  barber  and  beauty  shops,  airline  ticket  counters,  car  rental  agencies,  newsstands,  restaurants,  lounges,  bars,  gift  shops  and
health  clubs  or  spas,  in  each  case  which  constitute  a  Permitted  Use  and  do  not  constitute  a  Prohibited  Use  and  so  long  as  Tenant  shall
remain primarily liable for all of the obligations under this Lease.  Landlord's consent to any sublease shall not be required unless such
sublease constitutes a sublease for all or substantially all of the Premises.

Any such sublease shall be subordinate to this Lease and shall recognize the Landlord’s option to terminate such sublease in the
event this Lease is terminated following an Event of Default.  If Tenant delivers a sublease to the Landlord and requests that the Landlord
enter  into  a  non-disturbance  and  attornment  agreement  with  the  subtenant,  the  Landlord  will  not  refuse  to  execute  such  an  agreement,
provided that (i) at the time of the granting of such non-disturbance agreement no Event of Default is continuing, (ii) the sublease complies
with all other requirements of this Section 11.02, and (iii) the form is reasonably acceptable to Landlord in form and substance.

Section
11.03
Leasehold
Mortgages
.  Tenant shall have the right to mortgage, pledge or conditionally assign this Lease to a
Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  Section  and  ARTICLE  XII,  and  the  payment  to  the  Landlord  of  any
amounts due, if any on account thereof, under ARTICLE IV above.  In no event shall the fee interest in the Premises or, unless specifically
set  forth  herein  or  in  any  instrument  given  by  the  Landlord  in  connection  therewith,  any  Rent  be  subordinate  to  any  leasehold
mortgage.  Regardless of whether any such leasehold mortgage requires the Landlord’s consent, Tenant shall provide the Landlord with
written notice of any such leasehold mortgage at least thirty (30) days prior to the closing of any such transaction.

The making of a mortgage under the prior paragraph shall not be deemed to constitute an assignment, nor shall any mortgagee
under  such  a  mortgage  not  in  actual  possession  of  the  Premises  be  deemed  an  assignee  of  the  leasehold  estate  created  hereby,  so  as  to
require such mortgagee to assume the obligations of Tenant hereunder. However, a mortgagee in actual possession and the purchaser at
any  sale  of  the  leasehold  estate  created  hereby  upon  foreclosure  of  a  mortgage  given  in  accordance  with  the  prior  paragraph,  or  the
assignee of Tenant’s interest under this Lease pursuant to an assignment in lieu of such foreclosure, shall be deemed to be an assignee of
Tenant (but no consent by the Landlord to such assignment or transfer shall be required) and subject to the terms and conditions of Section
12.02 hereof, shall be deemed to

have  assumed  the  obligations  of  Tenant  hereunder  arising  from  and  after  the  date  of  taking  actual  possession  or  of  such  purchase  or
assignment.  Prior to taking possession of the Premises following a foreclosure by any mortgagee, such mortgagee shall cure all monetary
defaults and non-monetary defaults that are not Incurable Lease Defaults.  If a mortgagee (or nominee) who has so assumed the obligations
of  Tenant  hereunder  thereafter  assigns  its  interests  in  this  Lease  to  an  assignee  who  assumes  the  obligations  of  Tenant  hereunder,  such
mortgagee (or nominee), upon compliance by such assignee with Maryland laws, shall be relieved of the obligations of Tenant arising after
such assignment and assumption.  A conditional assignment of Tenant’s interest in this Lease to a mortgagee as security for a mortgage
granted  in  accordance  with  the  prior  paragraph  shall  not  constitute  an  assumption  of  liability  by  the  mortgagee  of  Tenant’s  obligations
hereunder  until  the  date  of  such  mortgagee’s  taking  of  actual  possession  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  its  rights  under  such  conditional
assignment;  provided,  however,  that  such  mortgagee  shall  cure  all  monetary  defaults  and  non-monetary  defaults  that  are  not  Incurable
Lease Defaults in existence as of the time of such foreclosure.

Section
11.04
Prohibited
Transfers
.  Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary, Tenant shall not
knowingly, after making reasonable inquiry, assign, sublease or otherwise transfer any of Tenant’s interest in the Hotel & Casino or other
Tenant Improvements or any of Tenant’s interest in the leasehold created hereby (collectively, “ Tenant’s Interest in the Premises ”) or any
Equity Interest in Tenant  to any Disqualified Person.  The term “ Disqualified Person ” shall mean:

(a)  Any  Person  (or  any  Person  whose  operations  are  directed  or  controlled  by  a  Person)  that  has  been  convicted  of  or  has
pleaded  guilty  in  a  criminal  proceeding  for  a  felony  or  that  is  an  on-going  target  of  a  grand  jury  investigation  convened  pursuant  to
applicable Requirements concerning organized crime; or

(b)  Any  Person  organized  in  or  controlled  from  a  country,  the  effects  of  the  activities  with  respect  to  which  are  regulated
or controlled pursuant to the following United States laws and the regulations or executive orders promulgated thereunder: (x) the Trading
with the Enemy Act of 1917, 50 U.S.C. App. §1, et seq., as amended; (y) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1976, 50
U.S.C. § 1701, et seq., as amended; and (z) the Anti-Terrorism and Arms Export Amendments Act of 1989, codified at Section 6(j) of the
Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. App. § 2405, as amended; or

(c)  Any  Person  with  whom  the  Landlord  is  restricted  from  doing  business  under  the  regulations  of  the  Office  of  Foreign
Asset Control of The Department of the Treasury of the United States of America (“ OFAC ”) (including, those Persons named on OFAC’s

Blocking  Property  and  Prohibiting  Transactions  with  Persons  Who  Commit,  Threaten  to  Commit,  or  Support  Terrorism),  or  other

Section

Assignment
of

License
.  Tenant shall not assign, grant, or otherwise transfer or encumber the Gaming

License, except as set forth herein.

Section
11.06
Transfers
That
May
Jeopardize
Gaming
License
.  Landlord  acknowledges that Tenant, its Parent and their
respective  Affiliates  are  engaged  in  businesses  that  are  or  may  be  subject  to  and  exist  because  of  privileged  licenses  issued  by
governmental authorities, including under applicable laws with respect to gaming (“ Gaming Laws ”).  If (A) Tenant, its Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates is directed to cease doing business with Landlord by any such authority, or (B) if Tenant determines, in Tenant’s
sole  and  exclusive  judgment,  that  (i)  because  of  the  relationship  with  Landlord,  the  continued  operation  of  the  Hotel  &  Casino  could
subject Tenant, its Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to the loss of the Gaming License or any approvals under any Gaming Laws
in any jurisdiction then held or proposed by Tenant, its Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, or (ii) Landlord or any of its Affiliates,
or  any  of  their  respective  officers,  directors,  key  employees,  agents  or  representatives,  (a)  is  or  might  be  engaged  in,  or  is  about  to  be
engaged  in,  any  activity  or  (b)  was  or  is  involved  in  any  relationship,  either  of  which  could  or  does  jeopardize  such  approvals  or
applications for such approvals, or (c) was or is a Disqualified Person, or if any such approval is threatened to be or is denied, suspended or
revoked,  then  Tenant  shall  deliver  notice  to  Landlord  of  such  issue  and  permit  Landlord  one  hundred  twenty  (120)  days  to  cure  the
violation or potential violation of Gaming Laws due to any matter under Section 11.06(ii) immediately above, and if Landlord is diligently
pursuing  such  cure  such  longer  time  as  may  be  reasonably  necessary  to  cure.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  cure  right  shall  be
afforded in the event Tenant, its Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is directed to immediately cease doing business with Landlord
by any governmental authorities with jurisdiction over the Gaming License or any approvals under any Gaming Laws in any jurisdiction
then held or proposed by Tenant, its Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.  If Landlord is unable or unwilling to cure the issue, Tenant
may (y) terminate this Lease without liability to either party except for such liabilities that expressly survive termination, or (z) elect to
purchase Landlord's fee interest in the Premises (the “ Purchase Option ”) by so notifying Landlord in writing.  In the event Tenant elects
the  Purchase  Option,  the  parties  shall  negotiate  for  a  period  of  thirty  (30)  days  to  determine  the  purchase  price,  which  shall  be  the  fair
market value of the fee simple interest in the Premises, including the value of the Tenant Improvements as of the expiration of the Term,
and taking into account the value of the future Rent payments under this Lease.  If the parties cannot agree upon the fair market value, the
purchase price shall be determined by the appraisal process set forth in Section 11.07 below.

Section
11.07
Appraisal
Process
.  Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint an appraiser within twenty (20) days following the
expiration  of  the  thirty  (30)  day  negotiation  period  (the  “  Appointment  Deadline  ”).  All  appraisers  shall  be  members  of  the  Appraisal
Institute or any successor organization thereto, and give notice of such appointment to the other party.  If either party fails to appoint its
appraiser  before  the  Appointment  Deadline,  then  the  one  appraiser  appointed  shall  proceed  to  make  his/her  appraisal  of  the  of  the  fair
market value of the Premises, and the purchase price shall be the amount determined by such appraiser. If each party timely appoints its
appraiser then each appraiser shall make an independent written appraisal within

thirty (30) days of the Appointment Deadline, the expenses of such appraisals shall be borne by the party selecting the appraiser. If the two
appraisers so appointed agree on the purchase price then the purchase price shall be the amount determined by them.  If the two appraisers
so appointed do not agree on the purchase price, and if the difference between the purchase price determined by each appraiser is not more
than five  percent  (5%) of the lower  of the two appraisals,  then the purchase  price shall be an amount  equal  to the quotient  obtained  by
dividing (A) the sum of the purchase prices by each appraiser, by (B) two.  If the two appraisers so appointed do not agree on the purchase
price, and if the difference between the Appraised Values determined by each appraiser is more than five percent (5%) of the lower of the
two appraisals, then the two appraisers shall jointly appoint a third appraiser, the expense of any third appraisal shall be divided equally
between the parties.  If the first two appraisers so appointed shall be unable to agree on the appointment of a third appraiser within ten (10)
days after their respective determinations of the purchase price, then they shall give written notice of such failure to agree to the parties.  If
the parties fail to agree on the selection of a third appraiser within ten (10) days after the first two appraisers give such notice, then within
fifteen (15) days thereafter any party, upon written notice to the other party, may request such appointment by the then-existing President
of the Appraisal Institute (or any other organization successor thereto), or in his/her failure to act, may apply for such appointment to the
United States District Court for Maryland.  If a third appraiser is appointed as provided herein, he/she shall make his/her determination of
the  purchase  price  within  fifteen  (15)  days  after  his/her  appointment  and  the  purchase  price  shall  be  the  purchase  price  determined  by
whichever of the first two appraisers is (in the opinion of the third appraiser) closest in amount to the purchase price as determined by the
third appraiser.  Each appraiser appointed pursuant to this Section shall be a disinterested person of nationally recognized competence who
has  had  a  minimum  of  ten  (10)  years’  experience,  ending  on  the  date  of  appointment,  in  appraising  full-service  hotel  and  casino
properties.  Each appraiser shall determine the purchase price on the basis of all relevant factors affecting fair market value of the Premises
with  reference  to  the  value  of  the  Tenant  Improvements  as  of  the  expiration  of  the  Term  and  including  the  value  of  the  future  Rent
payments under this Lease.  The party appointing each appraiser shall be obligated, promptly after receipt of the valuation report prepared
by the appraiser appointed by such party, to deliver a copy of such valuation report to the other party in the manner provided in Section
18.04.  If a third appraiser is appointed, the third appraiser shall be directed, at the time of his/her appointment, to deliver copies of his/her
valuation report, promptly after its completion, to all parties in the manner provided in Section 18.04.

Section
11.08
Purchase
Option
Closing
.

(a)  Within  one  (1)  business  days  after  determination  of  the  purchase  price,  Tenant  shall  deposit  in  cash  an  amount  equal
to ten percent (10%) of the purchase price (the “ Earnest Money ”) in a strict joint order escrow with a nationally recognized title insurance
company  selected  by  the  Landlord,  pursuant  to  the  standard  form  of  strict  joint  order  escrow  trust  instructions  for  such  title  insurance
company, with any modifications thereto which are necessary to conform such instructions to the terms of this Lease.  The Earnest Money
shall be deposited in a federally insured interest-bearing account reasonably acceptable to the parties, and all interest earned thereon shall
be deemed additional Earnest Money.

(b)  The  sale  of  the  Preemies  from  Landlord  to  Tenant  (the  “  Closing  ”)  shall  take  place  on  the  date  which  is  fifteen  days
(15) days after the deposit of the Earnest Money (the “ Closing Date ”).  The conveyance of the Premises shall be on an AS-IS WHERE-

Tenant a quitclaim deed along with any documentation required to record the deed.  Tenant shall pay all transfer taxes, recording fees or
other fees in connection with the exercise of the Purchase Option. Tenant may designate an Affiliate to purchase all or any portion of the
Premises; provided, however, that Tenant shall remain liable for its obligations under this Lease.  If Tenant fails to close for any reason,
Landlord  shall retain the Earnest  Money as liquidated  damages and Tenant’s  right to exercise the Purchase Option under Section 11.06
above shall be null and void.

(c)  If  Landlord  cures  the  event  that  permitted  tenant  to  exercise  the  Purchase  Option  under  Section  11.06  above,  prior  to
the Closing, the parties agree that the Purchase Option shall cease, the Earnest Money shall be returned to Tenant, and Landlord shall no
longer have the obligation to sell, and Tenant shall no longer have the right to purchase the Premises as a result of such event.

empowered to make loans or issue bonds or certificates or any other lender or syndicate of lenders or investors engaged in the
making of loans or equity investments or, to the extent not meeting the above criteria, otherwise approved by the Landlord in

The Landlord shall have the right to reasonably approve such evidence as is reasonably necessary for it to determine that the Permitted
Leasehold Mortgage and the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee satisfy the requirements of this Article.  Any Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee
may request in connection with the granting of any such Mortgage or from time to time, that the Landlord acknowledge such status; and
upon receiving reasonable documentation of the aforesaid clauses (i) through (vi), the Landlord shall so acknowledge such status in form
reasonably satisfactory to such Mortgagee.

Permitted
Leasehold
Mortgagee

accept performance on the part of the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee as though it had been done or performed by Tenant.  No payment
made  to  the  Landlord  by  the  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  shall  constitute  agreement  that  such  payment  was,  in  fact,  due  under  the
terms of this Lease.

(c)  Time  to  Obtain  Possession  .    The  Landlord  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  a  non-monetary  default  which  cannot  be  cured

other than the then Tenant which has defaulted (“ Incurable Lease Defaults ”), the Landlord’s right to terminate this Lease shall be waived
with respect to the matters which have been cured by the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee and with respect to the Incurable Lease Defaults.

(d)  New  Lease  .    If  this  Lease  (a)  is  terminated  as  a  result  of  a  default  on  the  part  of  Tenant,  (b)  rejected  by  a  trustee  or
debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving Tenant (such proceeding, a “ Bankruptcy Proceeding ”), or (c)
terminated  as  a  result  of  any  Bankruptcy  Proceeding  and,  if  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  such  rejection  or  termination,  the  Permitted
Leasehold Mortgagee or its nominee(s) shall request and certify in writing to Landlord that it intends to perform the obligations of Tenant
as and to the extent required hereunder, the Landlord shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions provided below, on written request
of the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee made at any time within sixty (60) days after the Landlord has given notice of such termination to
the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default), enter into a new lease of the Premises with
the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or nominee) within sixty (60) days after receipt of such request.  Until the expiration of such period,
Landlord shall not enter into any new lease, license or occupancy or operation agreement with any Person which would conflict with the
rights  afforded  the Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  hereunder.   Any such new lease for a Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  (or nominee)
shall be effective as of the date of termination of this Lease, and, except as provided below, shall be upon all the same terms and conditions
of this Lease which would have been in effect had the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or nominee) taken an assignment of the leasehold
estate under this Lease from Tenant, including any rights of renewal.  The initial term of any such lease shall be the remainder of the then
current Term of this Lease.  The Landlord shall not be obligated to enter into such a new lease with the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or
nominee) unless (i) the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or nominee) shall, contemporaneously with the delivery of such request for a new
lease, pay to the Landlord all Rent and other charges owed by Tenant to the Landlord which then remain unpaid and the Rent and other
charges for the period after termination of this Lease and until commencement of the new lease which would have become due under this
Lease  (less  any  Rent  or  other  charges  for  such  periods  actually  collected  by  the  Landlord  from  subtenants  or  other  occupants  of  the
Premises), together with all expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the Landlord in connection with the termination of
this  Lease  and  the  execution  and  delivery  of  such  new  lease,  and  (ii)  the  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  (or  nominee)  shall  have
performed  all  unfulfilled  covenants  and  agreements  required  to  be  performed  by  Tenant  under  this  Lease  other  than  Incurable  Lease
Defaults. The Landlord shall have no obligation to deliver physical possession of the Premises to the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or
nominee) at the time of entering into such new lease unless the Landlord, at the time of execution and delivery of such

granted the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee (or nominee) pursuant to this Section 11.02(d) shall enjoy the same priority as this Lease over
any lien, encumbrance, or other interest created by the Landlord prior to the execution of such new lease.  The provisions of this Section
11.02(d) shall survive the termination of this Lease. References herein as to this "Lease" shall be deemed also to refer to such new ground
lease.

(e)  Effect  of  Assumption  on  Assuming  Party  .    In  the  event  that  the  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  or  its  nominees,  or
any  permitted  purchaser,  transferee,  grantee  or  assignee  of  the  interests  of  the  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  (any  such  person,  an  “
Assuming Party ”), assumes any liability hereunder, liability and recourse in respect of any and all obligations of any such Assuming Party
hereunder shall be limited solely to such Assuming Party's interest in this Lease (and no officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent
thereof shall have any liability with respect thereto).

(a)  Notices  .    Simultaneously  with  the  giving  to  Tenant  of  any  process  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  for
foreclosure of a Permitted Leasehold Mortgage or any notice of (i) default or acceleration under a Permitted Leasehold Mortgage, (ii) a
matter  on  which  such a default  or acceleration  may  be predicated  or claimed,  (iii)  a foreclosure  of a Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgage,  or
(iv)  a  condition  which  if  continued  may  lead  to  such  foreclosure,  the  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgagee  will  endeavor  to  give  duplicate
copies thereof to the Landlord by registered mail, return receipt requested; however; failure to so to give such notice shall never affect the
rights of such Mortgagee.

(b)  Right  to  Cure  .    The  Landlord,  may,  during  the  same  period  as  is  given  Tenant  for  remedying  the  default,  cure  for  and
on  behalf  of  Tenant  plus  (a)  an  additional  fifteen  (15)  days  for  a  monetary  default,  and  (b)  an  additional  thirty  (30)  days  for  any  non-
monetary default.  The Permitted  Leasehold Mortgagee  agrees to accept performance  on the part of the Landlord  as though it had been
done or performed by Tenant.  No payment made to the Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee by the Landlord shall constitute agreement that
such payment was, in fact, due under the terms of the Permitted Leasehold Mortgage.

(c)  Amendment  .    The  Permitted  Leasehold  Mortgage  shall  not  be  amended  in  any  manner  that  would  cause  it  to  no

longer qualify as a Permitted Leasehold Mortgage without the prior written consent of the Landlord.

an Affiliate of Tenant, then such replacement manager shall be subject to the prior written approval of Landlord, which approval shall be
made in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion.   No manager may take over the management of the Hotel & Casino unless such manager

the operating, management and financial reporting functions required under this Agreement, consistent with the Brand Standards, (ii) itself

withheld, conditioned or delayed.

THE
LANDLORD’S
SECURITY
INTEREST

Section
14.01
Waiver
of
Security
Interest
.  Solely for the purpose of securing Tenant’s obligations to perform its obligations
under this Lease, Tenant hereby grants to the Landlord a security interest in all Building Equipment, FF&E and other personal property of
Tenant  with  respect  to  the  Hotel  &  Casino  and  in  all  products  and  proceeds  thereof;  provided,  however,  that  the  Landlord’s  security
interest  shall  be  automatically  fully  subordinate  and  subject  to  any  purchase  money  financing  permitted  hereunder  and  the  Permitted
Leasehold Mortgagees’ security interest in the assets of the Tenant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the assets pledged to Landlord shall
not include any license, permit, or authorization issued by any of the gaming authorities, or any other governmental authority or any other
assets solely to the extent a security interest therein is prohibited under gaming laws, or other applicable law, or under the terms of any
such license, permit, or authorization, or which would require a finding of suitability or other similar approval or procedure by any of the
gaming authorities, or any other governmental authority prior to being pledged, hypothecated, or given as collateral security (to the extent
such  finding  or  approval  has  not  been  obtained)  other  than  to  the  extent  that  any  such  term  would  be  rendered  ineffective  pursuant  to
Sections  9-406,  9-407,  9-408  or  9-409  of  the  UCC  (or  any  successor  provision  or  provisions)  of  any  relevant  jurisdiction  or  any  other
applicable  law  (including  any  Debtor  Relief  Law)  or  principles  of  equity  (the  “Excluded  Assets”).    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  all
proceeds of the Excluded Assets shall constitute assets and shall be included within the property and assets over which a security interest is
granted pursuant to this Lease.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, the Landlord shall be entitled to all of the rights,
remedies,  powers  and  privileges  available  to  a  secured  party  under  (and  subject  to  the  provisions  of)  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code
enacted by the State of Maryland.  Tenant shall execute and deliver all such instruments and take all such action as the Landlord, from time
to time, may reasonably request in order to obtain the full benefits of the security interest described in this Section and of the rights and
powers herein created and to maintain and perfect the security interest granted above.  To the extent permitted by

foregoing  collateral  without  the  signature  of  Tenant.    The  Landlord  shall  execute  and  deliver  all  such  instruments  as  the  Permitted
Leasehold  Mortgagee(s)  shall  reasonably  require  in  order  to  confirm  the  Landlord’s  subordination  of  its  security  interest  as
aforesaid.  Tenant may, during the Term, remove, replace and otherwise deal with the FF&E in the ordinary course of the operation of the
Hotel & Casino.  The Landlord hereby waives any statutory lien for rent provided to the Landlord pursuant to applicable law.

TERMINATION
AND
DEFAULT

Section
15.01
Surrender
.  Tenant  shall on the last day  of the Term,  or upon  any earlier  termination  of this Lease,  quit  and
peacefully surrender and deliver up the Premises, including the Tenant Improvements and all other improvements to the Premises, to the
possession and use of the Landlord without delay and in good order, condition and repair (excepting only reasonable wear and tear and
damage  from  a Taking  or  from  a  fire  or  other  casualty  after  the  last  repair,  replacement,  restoration  or  renewal  required  to  be  made  by
Tenant, all as provided under this Lease) and in accordance with the Brand Standards.  The Premises shall at that time be free and clear of
all leases and occupancies, except as may be permitted under this Lease.  The Premises shall be surrendered free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances other than those existing at the commencement of the Term, or created or suffered by the Landlord or permitted hereunder
and shall be surrendered without any payment by the Landlord on account of Tenant Improvements or any other improvements which may
be on the Premises.  Upon or at any time after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, subject to the rights of any subtenant or
other occupant under a non-disturbance and attornment agreement executed by the Landlord and such subtenant or occupant pursuant to
Section 11.02, the Landlord may, without further notice, enter upon and re-enter the Premises and possess and repossess itself thereof, by
force, summary proceedings,  ejectment or otherwise, and may dispossess Tenant and remove Tenant and all other persons and property
from the Premises, and may have, hold and enjoy the Premises and the right to receive all income from the same.

Upon termination of this Lease, whether at the end of the Term or upon any earlier termination, all Building Equipment, and the
portion  of  the  FF&E  located  on  the  Hotel  portion  of  the  Premises  and  other  personal  property  then  located  on  the  Hotel  portion  of  the
Premises  shall  be  surrendered  to  and  become  the  property  of  the  Landlord.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  upon  the  expiration  of  the
Term or upon an earlier termination of the Lease for any reason other than an Event of Default, FF&E in the Casino and other movable
personal property and trade fixtures installed at the expense of Tenant or any sublessee, but excluding any Building Equipment or Hotel
Property, may be removed by Tenant or such sublessee, and shall not be deemed to be attached to the freehold nor the property of, nor
surrendered to, Landlord, provided that the removal of any such property does not structurally injure the Tenant Improvements, necessitate
changes in the Tenant Improvements or render the Tenant Improvements or any part thereof unfit for use and occupancy.  Tenant shall pay
the cost of repairing any damage to the Premises or Tenant Improvements arising from the removal of such property, and such obligation
shall survive the Term.  All such property not so removed by the expiration or earlier

of in such manner as Landlord sees fit with the right to retain any proceeds therefrom as its own. Within one (1) year prior to the end of the
Term. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a list of FF&E and other movable personal property and trade fixtures that Tenant intends to
remove upon expiration or earlier termination of this Lease for any reason other than an Event of Default.

For  purposes  of  this  Lease,  “  Building Equipment ”  shall  mean  all  installations  incorporated  in,
located  at or  attached  to  and used  or usable  in the  operation  of,  or in  connection  with,  the Premises  and
shall  include,  but  shall  not  be  limited  to,  machinery,  apparatus,  devices,  motors,  engines,  generators,

however, any personal property which is owned by Subtenants, licensees, concessionaires or contractors.  “
Hotel Property ” shall mean all personal property, inventory, movable furniture, and fixtures located in or
used in the Hotel, but excluding any Hotel Property branded with the MGM brand.

Upon  termination  of  this  Lease,  whether  at  the  end  of  the  Term  or  upon  any  earlier  termination,  Tenant  shall  reasonably
cooperate with Landlord in connection with the transition of the gaming license to the new operator of the Hotel & Casino (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Landlord in a smooth transition of the Premises so that
operation  of  the  Hotel  &  Casino  is  not  interrupted;  provided,  however,  in  no  event  shall  Tenant  be  required  to  share  confidential  or
proprietary information of Tenant with either Landlord or the new operator of the Hotel & Casino.

Section
15.02
Events
of
Default
.  If any one or more of the following events (herein called “ Events of Default ”) shall happen:

(a)  If  default  shall  be  made  in  the  due  and  punctual  payment  of  any  Base  Rent  or  Additional  Rent  when  and  as  the  same
shall  become  due  and  payable,  and  such  default  shall  continue  for  a  period  of  five  (5)  days  after  notice  from  the  Landlord  to  Tenant
specifying the items in default (provided that such notice need not be given on more than two (2) occasions in any twelve (12) consecutive
months); or

(b)  If  default  shall  be  made  in  the  due  and  punctual  payment  of  any  other  Rent  or  sums  payable  under  this  Lease  or  any

notice from the Landlord to Tenant specifying the items in default; or

(d)  If  Tenant  loses  its  right  to  the  Gaming  License  or  any  other  licenses,  permits  or  approvals  necessary  for  the  operation

of the Hotel & Casino in accordance with the terms of this Lease, beyond any applicable appeals, as a result of Misconduct by Tenant; or

(e)  If  the  Premises  shall  be  abandoned,  deserted,  or  vacated  by  Tenant,  it  being  understood  that  the  Premises  shall  be
deemed abandoned, deserted, or vacated if, after the Opening Date, a hotel and casino is not operated on the Premises in accordance with
Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days for any reason other than (i) the process of restoration following
a casualty or taking (which restoration requires more than thirty (30) days to be completed) or (ii) renovations which require more than
thirty (30) days to complete; or

(f)  If  default  shall  be  made  by  Tenant  in  the  performance  of  or  compliance  with  any  of  the  agreements,  terms,  covenants
or conditions in this Lease, other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) - (c) of this Section, for a period of thirty (30) days after notice
from the Landlord to Tenant specifying the items in default and Tenant fails to proceed within such thirty (30) day period to commence to
cure  the  same  and  thereafter  to  prosecute  the  curing  of  such  default  with  diligence  (it  being  intended  in  connection  with  a  default  not
reasonably susceptible of being cured with diligence within such thirty (30) day period that the time of Tenant within which to cure the
same  shall  be  extended  for  such  period  not  to  exceed  ninety  (90)  days  as  may  be  necessary  to  complete  the  same  with  all  diligence),
provided, however, if any such default under this clause (f) is of a nature that is not susceptible of being cured and, in the sole and absolute
judgment of Landlord, the existence of such default would not (i) have a material adverse effect on the value of the Premises or Tenant’s
ability to operate the Hotel & Casino in accordance with the Brand Standards, (ii) have an adverse effect on Tenant’s obligations to pay
Rent under this Lease, and (iii) constitute a default under any loan documents evidencing Approved Debt, then Tenant shall not be deemed
to be in default under this lease; or

(g) If a default on the part of Tenant occurs under the Declaration beyond all applicable grace and cure periods; or

(h)  If  Tenant  shall  initiate  the  appointment  of  a  receiver  to  take  possession  of  all  or  any  portion  of  the  Premises  or
Tenant’s  leasehold  estate  for  whatever  reason,  or  Tenant  shall  make  a  general  assignment  for  the  benefit  of  creditors,  or  Tenant  shall
initiate voluntary proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or law for the relief of debtors; or if there shall be initiated against
Tenant any such proceedings which are not dismissed within ninety (90) days;

then this Lease and the Term hereby demised shall expire and terminate on the date set forth in such Event of Default notice, and Tenant
shall remain liable as hereinafter provided and the Hotel & Casino and improvements located on the Premises shall become the property of
the Landlord without the necessity of any deed or conveyance from Tenant to the Landlord.  Tenant agrees upon request of the Landlord to
immediately execute and deliver to the Landlord any deeds, releases or other documents deemed necessary by the Landlord to evidence the
vesting in the Landlord of the ownership of all structures, alterations, additions, improvements, licenses and permits.

Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  including,  without  limitation,  Tenant’s  right  to  dispute  certain  alleged  defaults  under
subjection (i) above, and without limiting any of Landlord’s other rights and remedies hereunder, if Tenant is in default under this Lease
and the Landlord  has given any notice of such default hereunder,  and Tenant has failed to cure such default within any applicable  cure
period, then the Landlord may cure such default for the account of and at the cost and expense of Tenant, and the sums so expended by the
Landlord, including reasonable legal fees, shall be deemed to be payable by Tenant as Additional Rent.

Nothing  contained  herein  shall  affect  Tenant’s  right,  following  Tenant’s  payment  of  any  Rent  claimed  to  be  due  and  payable  by  the
Landlord,  to  dispute,  the  validity  of  the  Landlord’s  claim  with  respect  to  such  Rent.    Any  such  dispute  shall  be  subject  to  the  Dispute
Resolution Process.

Section
15.03
Relet
.   At any time or from time to time after any such expiration or termination, but subject to any rights of any
Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee hereunder who cures any Event of Default, the Landlord may relet the Premises or any part thereof for
such term or terms (which may be greater or less than the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term of this
Lease), on such conditions (which may include concessions or free rent and alterations of the Premises) and for such uses as the Landlord,
in its good faith discretion, may determine, and may collect and receive the rents therefor.  The Landlord shall in no way be responsible or
liable for any failure to relet the Premises or any part thereof, or for any failure to collect any rent due upon any such reletting.

Section
15.04
Remedies
.  No such expiration or termination of this Lease shall relieve Tenant of its liability and obligations
under this Lease, and such liability and obligations shall survive any such expiration or termination.  In the event of any such expiration or
termination, whether or not the Premises or any part thereof shall have been relet, Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the Rent and all other
charges required to be paid by Tenant up to the time of such expiration or termination of this Lease. Thereafter, Tenant, until the end of
what would have been the Term of this Lease in the absence of such expiration or termination, shall be liable to the Landlord for, and shall
pay to the Landlord, as and for liquidated and agreed current damages for Tenant’s default, the equivalent of the amount of the Rent and
charges which would be payable under this Lease taking into account all future Extension Periods (even if such Extension Periods have not
yet been exercised, but expressly taking into account any termination fee that would otherwise be payable for Tenant's failure to extend the
Term)  of  the  Term  by  Tenant  if  this  Lease  were  still  in  effect,  less  the  net  proceeds  of  any  reletting  after  deducting  all  the  Landlord’s
expenses  incurred  in  good  faith  in  connection  with  such  reletting,  including,  without  limitation,  all  repossession  costs,  brokerage  and
management commissions, operating expenses, legal expenses, reasonable attorney’s fees, alteration costs, and expenses of preparation for
such reletting, and less the value of any FF&E, Building Equipment and other personal property that is surrendered to and becomes the
property of Landlord pursuant to the terms of Section 15.01.

Tenant shall pay such current damages (herein called “ deficiency ”) to the Landlord on the date(s) on which the Rent would
have  been  payable  under  this  Lease  if  this  Lease  were  still  in  effect,  and  the  Landlord  shall  be  entitled  to  recover  from  Tenant  each
deficiency as the same shall arise.

At any time after such expiration or termination, in lieu of collecting any further deficiencies as aforesaid, the Landlord shall be
entitled  to  recover  from  Tenant  and  Tenant  shall  pay  to  the  Landlord,  on  demand,  as  and  for  liquidated  and  agreed  final  damages  for
Tenant’s default, an amount equal to the present value of the excess of the Rent reserved hereunder for the unexpired portion of the Term
over the then fair and reasonable rental value of the Premises for the same period, minus any such deficiencies for such period previously
recovered from Tenant.

If  at  any  time,  Tenant  receives  a  notice  of  default  from  Landlord  relating  to  Tenant’s  failure  to  comply  with  the  Brand
Standards,  Tenant  shall  deposit  two  percent  (2%)  of  gross  revenue  generated  from  the  Hotel  &  Casino  into  a  separate  interest-bearing
account established in Tenant’s name and for the benefit of Tenant (the “ Capital Reserve Account ”) solely for the purpose of funding
expenditures  for  capital  improvements  (but  not  including  the  initial  cost  of  constructing  the  Tenant  Improvements)  and  replacements  in
accordance with the terms of this Lease from and after the date of such notice.  Tenant shall deposit the amounts required to be deposited
into the Capital Reserve Account within thirty (30) days after the end of each month from and after receiving such notice for the remaining
Term of the Lease; provided, however, if no default by Tenant in complying with the Brand Standards shall occur for a five (5) year period
after the establishment of the Capital Reserve Account, Tenant shall be permitted to cease funding the Capital Reserve Account.  In the
event the use of the Capital Reserve Account has been triggered more than two (2) times during the Term hereof, then thereafter Tenant
shall not have the right to cease funding the Capital Reserve Account after a five (5) year period without defaults.  Tenant hereby grants to
the Landlord a security interest in the Capital Reserve Account, and all profits and proceeds thereof, in order to secure Tenant’s obligations
under  this    Section  15.04  (provided  that  such  security  interest  shall  be  automatically  subordinated  to  any  security  interest  granted  to  a
Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee provided such Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee shall obtain the Landlord’s prior written consent to apply

DISPUTE
RESOLUTION
PROCESS

Section
17.01
Dispute
Resolution
Process
.  The procedures in this Section are the “ Dispute Resolution Process. ”

(a)  The  parties  will  attempt  in  good  faith  to  resolve  any  controversy  with  respect  to  (i)  approvals  of  the  Approved  Master
Plan  and any additions  or modifications  of the Approved  Master  Plan;  (ii) disputes  as to the operating  standards  established  by Section
8.04; (iii) disputes regarding the reasonableness of either party’s actions, provided such party agreed to act reasonably in this Lease; (iv)
disputes  regarding  whether  a  Force  Majeure  Event  has  occurred  and  the  delays  attributable  to  a  Force  Majeure  Event;  (v)  disputes
regarding payment of Rent, but only if Tenant has paid the amount of disputed Rent to the Landlord and is not otherwise in default under
this Lease beyond any applicable cure period; and (vi) matters referred to and made subject to this Dispute Resolution Process, all of which
are specifically made subject to this Dispute Resolution Process.  The Dispute Resolution Process is as follows:

(b)  The  disputing  party  shall  give  the  other  party  written  notice  of  the  dispute  requesting  resolution  under  this  Section,
submitting  a  concise  written  statement  of  such  party’s  position  with  such  notice.    Within  ten  (10)  days  after  receipt  of  said  notice,  the
receiving party shall submit to the disputing party a concise written statement of the receiving party’s position.  Each party shall authorize
a senior officer to negotiate the dispute on behalf of that party, and in its notice shall identify such party by name and title and specifically
confirm that such identified party has full authority to negotiate and settle such dispute.  The senior officer designated by the Landlord and
Tenant are referred to hereinafter as the “ Principals ”.  The Principals shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within fifteen
(15) days of the date of the disputing party’s notice to attempt to resolve the dispute.  If the matter has not been resolved within thirty (30)
days of the disputing party’s notice, then any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled as set forth below.

(c)  If  the  parties  are  unable  to  resolve  a  dispute  by  meeting  as  described  in  Section  17.01(b)  above  within  such  thirty  (30)
day period, or such longer time period as may be agreed by the parties, the parties shall then attempt to resolve such dispute through a
process of mediation administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“ JAMS ”) or its successors.  If, at the time such
a dispute arises and is not resolved by Section 17.01(b) above, JAMS does not exist or is unable to administer the mediation of the dispute
in accordance with the terms of this Section 17.01(c), and the parties cannot agree on the identity of a substitute service provider, then the
complaining party shall petition to a court of competent jurisdiction located in Maryland to identify a substitute service provider, who will
administer the dispute resolution process in accordance with the terms of this Section.  The service provider identified in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 17.01(c) shall be referred to as the “ Mediator ”.

(d)  The  parties  shall  attempt  to  settle  any  dispute  by  participating  in  at  least  ten  (10)  hours  of  nonbinding  mediation  at  the
offices of the Mediator.  The complaining party must notify the other party that a dispute that cannot be resolved by Section 17.01(a) above
exists and then

contact the Mediator to schedule the mediation conference.  A designated individual mediator will then be selected in accordance with the
rules  of  the  Mediator  to  conduct  the  mediation;  provided , however ,  that  such  Mediator  must  have  experience  in  the  hotel  and  casino
industry (or in the event of a dispute with respect to a Taking, must have experience in condemnation proceedings) and must not have any
conflict of interest.  The mediation will be a nonbinding conference between the parties conducted in accordance with the applicable rules
and  procedures  of  the  Mediator.    Neither  party  may  initiate  litigation  or  arbitration  proceedings  with  respect  to  any  dispute  until  the
mediation  of  such  dispute  is  complete  with  the  sole  exception  of  seeking  emergency  relief  from  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  as
described  below.   Any  mediation  will  be considered  complete:  (i) if the parties  enter  into  an agreement  to resolve  the dispute;  (ii) with
respect  to  the  party  submitting  the  dispute  to  mediation,  if  the  other  party  fails  to  appear  at  or  participate  in  a  reasonably  scheduled
mediation conference; or (iii) if the dispute is not resolved within seven (7) days after the mediation is commenced.

(e)  If  any  dispute  remains  between  the  parties  after  the  mediation  is  complete,  then  either  party  shall  have  the  right  to

commence litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to any claims.

(f)  Any  litigation  of  a  dispute  must  be  initiated  within  one  (1)  year  from  the  date  on  which  either  party  first  gave  written
notice to the other of the existence of such dispute, and any party who fails to commence litigation within such one‑year period shall be
deemed to have waived any of its affirmative rights and claims in connection with such dispute and shall be barred from asserting such
rights and claims at any time thereafter.

market rent for the Premises as determined by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion.  Tenant shall be liable for all damages incurred
by the Landlord as a result of such holding over.  Such a holding over, even if with the consent of the Landlord, shall not constitute an
extension or renewal of this Lease.

GUARANTY

GUARANTY
OF
LEASE

THIS
GUARANTY
OF
LEASE
 (this  “  Guaranty
 ”)  is  made  as  of  ___________________,  2013  by  MGM  Resorts
International, a Delaware corporation (“ Guarantor
”), to and for the benefit of National Harbor Beltway L.C. , a Virginia limited liability
company (“ Landlord
”).

BACKGROUND:

WHEREAS
 ,  Landlord  is  “Landlord”  under  that  certain  Hotel  and  Casino  Ground  Lease  made  effective  as  of
______________________  (as  the  same  may  be  amended,  modified  or  supplemented  from  time  to  time,  the  “  Lease
”) naming MGM
National Harbor, LLC as “Tenant” (“ Tenant
”) with respect to a portion of the Beltway Parcel located in Prince George County in the
State of Maryland; and

WHEREAS
, Guarantor is a direct or indirect owner of Tenant and shall directly benefit from the execution of the Lease by

Tenant; and

WHEREAS
 ,  Guarantor  acknowledges  and  confirms  that:  (a)  the  Lease  by  Landlord  constitutes  valuable  consideration  to

Guarantor, and (c) this Guaranty is intended to be an inducement to Landlord to consent to the transactions described above.

NOW,
THEREFORE
, in consideration of the foregoing and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and as an inducement for Landlord to consent to the transactions contemplated above,
the Guarantor, intending to be legally bound hereby, agrees as follows:

1. All capitalized terms in this Guaranty and not defined herein shall have the defined meanings provided in the Lease.  Whenever
the context so requires, each reference to gender includes the masculine and feminine, the singular number includes the plural
and vice versa.   The  words  “hereof”  “herein”  and “hereunder”  and  words of similar  import  when  used in this Guaranty  shall
refer to this Guaranty as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Guaranty, and references to section, article, annex,
schedule, exhibit and like references are references to this Guaranty unless otherwise specified.  A Default or Event of Default
shall  “continue”  or  be  “continuing”  until  such  Default  or  Event  of  Default  has  been  cured  by  Tenant  or  waived  by
Landlord.  References in this Guaranty to any Person shall include such Person and its successors and permitted assigns.

2. Guarantor  irrevocably,  unconditionally  and  absolutely  guarantees  the  punctual  payment  when  due  of  all  Rent  or  any  other

present terms thereof or pursuant to any extension of time or to any change in the terms, covenants, agreements and conditions
thereof now or at any time hereafter made or granted pursuant to a signed agreement between Landlord and Tenant and (ii) all
costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) that may be incurred or
advanced by Landlord in the enforcement of this Guaranty as the result of any violation of Guarantor’s obligations hereunder
(collectively, the “ Payment
Obligations
”).

3. Guarantor  unconditionally  and  absolutely  guarantees  the  completion  of  the  Tenant  Improvements,  and  the  performance  by
Tenant of all the terms and provisions of the Lease pertaining to Tenant’s obligations with respect to the lien free completion of
the  Tenant  Improvements.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  Guarantor  guarantees  that:  (a)  the  Tenant
Improvements shall be completed no later than the Outside Completion Date; (b) the Tenant Improvements shall be completed
in  accordance  with  the  Approved  Master  Plan,  the  plans  and  specifications  (and,  to  the  extent  necessary,  Guarantor  shall  use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any construction agreements and related warranties), the Brand Standards, applicable
laws, and the other provisions of the Lease, without substantial deviation therefrom unless approved by Landlord in writing or as
otherwise permitted under the Lease (collectively, the “ Completion
Obligations
”).

4. Guarantor unconditionally and absolutely guarantees all other obligations and performance of Tenant under the Lease that are
not  Payment  Obligations  or  Completion  Obligations  until  the  last  date  that  any  of  Guarantor’s  obligations  expire  under  any
guaranty  provided  in  connection  with  the  Gaming  License  (collectively,  the  “ Performance
Obligations
 ”, together with the
Completion  Obligations  and  Payment  Obligations,  the  “  Guaranteed
Obligations
 ”).  In  no  event  shall  this  Guaranty  cover
consequential, unforeseeable or punitive damages of Landlord unless such damages are brought in connection with a third-party
claim for which Tenant or Guarantor is obligated to indemnify Landlord.

5.

This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection.  If any Guaranteed Obligation is not satisfied when
due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the Guarantor shall forthwith satisfy such Guaranteed Obligation, upon demand, and
no  such  satisfaction  shall  discharge  the  obligations  of  the  Guarantor  hereunder  until  all  Guaranteed  Obligations  have  been
indefeasibly paid in cash and performed and satisfied in full except to the extent provided in Section 25 hereof.  The liability of
Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary and direct and not conditional or contingent upon the solvency of Tenant or any
other  Person,  any  obligation  or  circumstance  which  might  otherwise  constitute  a  legal  or  equitable  discharge  or  defense  of  a
surety  or  guaranty  or  the  pursuit  by  Landlord  of  any  remedies  it  may  have  against  Tenant  or  any  other  guarantor  of  the
Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person.  The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall not in any way be affected by any
lawful action taken or not taken by Landlord or by the partial or complete unenforceability or invalidity of any other guaranty or
surety agreement, pledge, assignment, lien or other security interest or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations or of the
value, genuineness, validity or

obligations under the Lease; (e) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety

AMENDMENT
TO

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO HOTEL AND CASINO GROUND LEASE (the “ First Amendment ”) is made this 23rd day
of July, 2014 (the “ Effective Date ”) by and between NATIONAL

, a Virginia limited liability company
(the “ Landlord ”) and MGM
NATIONAL

LLC,
a Nevada limited liability company (the “ Tenant ”), with reference to the
following:

Exhibit
10.4(4)

RECITALS :

WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant entered into that certain Hotel and Casino Ground Lease  dated April 26, 2013 (the “ Lease

”), for the lease of certain real property more particularly described in the Lease (the “ Premises ”); and

WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the terms of the Lease as set forth herein.

NOW,  THEREFORE,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is  hereby  acknowledged,

Landlord and Tenant agree as follows:

1.  Recitals.    The  Recitals  set  forth  above  are  incorporated  herein  and  made  a  part  hereof  by  this  reference  as  if  fully  set

forth herein.

2.  Defined  Terms  .    All  capitalized  terms  used  herein,  unless  specifically  defined  herein,  shall  have  the  same  meanings

and definitions as used in the Lease.

3.  Final  Parcel  Determination  .    Landlord  and  Tenant  acknowledge  and  agree  that  they  have  agreed  upon  a  revised  lease
line on the Easterly border of the Premises as shown on Exhibit
A
attached hereto.  As a result, Exhibit “A” attached to the Lease shall be
deleted  and  replaced  by  Exhibit
A
 attached  hereto.      Exhibit
A
 shall  be  further  amended  and  replaced  by  Landlord  and  Tenant  in  a
mutually acceptable future amendment to the Lease once the process with the Maryland State Highway Administration (the “ MSHA ”)
has  been  completed  with  respect  to  (i)  the  dedication  by  Landlord  of  certain  easements/rights-of-way/areas  (the  “  Dedication  Areas  ”)
affecting the Premises as needed in connection with the roadways adjacent to the Premises, (ii) the abandonment of certain storm water
management easements (the “ Abandonment Areas ”), and (iii) the creation by MSHA of permanent easements for the benefit of Landlord,

Rent  Calculation  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit
H
 .  Upon  Landlord’s  written  request,  Tenant  shall  withhold  the  payment  of  Base  Rent  to
Landlord  for  a  period  of  time  designated  by  Landlord  and  instead  provide  to  Landlord  a  credit  against  amounts  owed  to  Tenant  by
Landlord under the Circle Road Declaration (as hereinafter defined) equal to the amount of Base Rent withheld by Tenant.

4.  Detailed  Site  Plan  .    Landlord  has  agreed  to  allow  Tenant  to  act  as  the  applicant  for  modifications  needed  to  the
Beltway  Parcel  Detailed  Site  Plan  07073  (the  “  Beltway  Parcel  DSP  ”)  to  allow  Tenant  to  construct  the  Tenant  Improvements  on  the
Premises.  Tenant  is  currently  processing  certain  modifications  known  as  DSP  07073-01  (“  Tenant’s  DSP  Modification  ”).    No
modifications to the Beltway Parcel DSP (including without limitation any future modifications or conditions proposed to Tenant’s DSP
Modification) shall be made by Tenant without Landlord’s consent (which consent may be given or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion,
but Landlord shall act in a commercially reasonable manner in exercising its sole discretion) that will: (i) have an adverse effect (which
shall include an adverse impact on traffic or trips) on the development of the portion of the Beltway Parcel that is not the Premises (the “
Remaining  Beltway  Parcel  ”),  (ii)  impose  additional  obligations  (other  than  those  of  a  de  minimis  nature)  on  the  Remaining  Beltway
Parcel,  the Landlord  or the owner  of the Remaining  Beltway  Parcel, or (iii) increase  the cost to develop  the Remaining  Beltway  Parcel
(unless Tenant agrees in writing to pay all such costs); provided , however , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may undertake any
modifications of the Beltway Parcel DSP, without Landlord’s consent, to the extent such modifications are consistent with the expansion
rights granted to Tenant (or are otherwise contemplated or permitted) under the Lease (the “ Permitted DSP Modifications ”). As a result,
and except for the Permitted DSP Modifications, Tenant shall submit all of Tenant’s proposed modifications to the Beltway Parcel DSP
and/or  Tenant’s  DSP  Modification  and/or  the  conditions  proposed  in  connection  with  such  modifications  to  Landlord  at  least  five  (5)
business days prior to submitting the same for approval by the applicable governmental authorities. For those modifications that require
Landlord’s  approval,  Landlord  agrees  to  respond  in  writing  to  any  written  request  from  Tenant  for  approval  (which  request  shall
specifically state the desired modification and the reason for such modification) no later than five (5) business days after Landlord’s receipt
of Tenant’s written request for approval, and to provide Tenant with a reasonably-detailed explanation for any Landlord disapproval.  Any
failure of Landlord to respond within such 5-day period shall be deemed to be Landlord’s approval of the same.

5.  License  for  Staging  Area  and  Parking  Area.         Landlord  represents  and  warrants  to  Tenant  that  Landlord  is  the  owner
of the land comprising  the Staging  Area and the Parking Area and the holder of the RGP. Landlord  does hereby grant to Tenant (at no
charge or cost to Tenant, except as otherwise set forth herein) a license to use and utilize those portions of the Beltway Parcel that are not
included  within  the  Premises  (which  areas  are  identified  as  the  Parcel  “B”  Staging  Area  containing  approximately  7.479  acres  (the  “
Staging Area ”) and as the Parcel “C” Parking Area containing approximately 5.99 acres (the “ Parking Area ”) on Exhibit
C
attached to
this  First  Amendment).    The  Staging  Area  may  be  used  as  a  construction  staging  area  for  Tenant’s  construction  staging  and  for  other
related construction purposes, including, without limitation, transport and storage of equipment, goods and materials, parking (including
overnight parking) of temporary construction trailers and vehicles, including passenger vehicles for

motorcycles, SUVs, pick-up trucks, and other similar vehicles, and for the placement of no more than four (4) construction office trailers
and temporary utilities to serve such trailers in the area measuring 100 feet by 100 feet as shown on Exhibit

, provided that no storage
trailers or outside storage of materials  shall be permitted  on the Parking Area.   Tenant agrees to accommodate  (which accommodation
shall not effect a termination  of this license) any request by Landlord for Tenant to temporarily  reduce or cease parking on the Parking
Area  to  allow  overflow  parking  on  the  Parking  Area  for  customers  and  employees  of  the  nearby  Tanger  Outlet  Center  (“  Tanger
Customers”) (i) during the seasonal peak shopping periods described below and (ii) upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice
from  Landlord  (which  notice  period  shall  be  reduced  to  ten  (10)  days  if  Landlord  can  provide  an  alternative  parking  area  within  the
National Harbor development at no cost to Tenant) on up to five additional periods per year (which additional periods shall not exceed a
total  of  15  days  per  year).  For  purposes  hereof,  the  seasonal  peak  shopping  periods  are  as  follows:    Thanksgiving  day  through  and
including January 3; Saturdays and Sundays during the month of August; and Maryland Tax-Free dates. Tenant shall not be responsible or
liable for that portion of the Parking Area that is in use by the customers or employees or others of the Tanger Outlet Center, including any
events, occurrences, injuries, deaths, damages, losses or other matters arising from, or in connection with, the use of the Parking Area by
invitees, employees or customers of the Tanger Outlet Center.  In addition, upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice from
Landlord, Landlord shall have the right to suspend for a reasonable period of time Tenant’s right to use the Parking Area for up to five (5)
business days in order for Landlord to install certain improvements to the parking facilities on the Parking Area, provided that Landlord’s
right to suspend Tenant’s use right shall not be exercised more than two (2) times in any 12-month period. The parties recognize that the
Parcel “B” portion of the Staging Area surrounds the Addison Family Cemetery Historic Site, as shown on Exhibit
C
.  Landlord and TPC
(as  defined  below)  agree  to  promptly  and  timely  address  and  resolve  (at  no  cost  to  Tenant)  any  issues  relating  to  the  Addison  Family
Cemetery Historic Site (including access to the site and installation of “Jersey barriers”) that are required or necessary to be resolved in
order to permit Tenant and its contractors, subcontractors, employees and designees to use the Staging Area for the purposes permitted
under this First Amendment. Tenant’s right to use the Staging Area and the Parking Area shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
terminate  on  the  date  which  is  eighteen  (18)  months  after  the  Effective  Date  if  not  sooner  terminated  pursuant  to  the  terms  hereof.    If
Landlord  needs  any  portion  of  the  Staging  Area  or  the  Parking  Area  to  begin  development  or  construction  on  a portion  of  the  Beltway
Parcel that is not part of the Premises, Landlord may terminate the license (as to that portion of the Staging Area or the Parking Area that is
needed by Landlord to begin development or construction) effective any time after the date which is twelve (12) months after the Effective
Date by providing Tenant at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of the termination.  Tenant may install (at Tenant’s cost) temporary
improvements, including, but not limited to, trailers, fencing and gravel parking on the Staging Area and Parking Area.  Tenant’s use of the
Staging Area and the Parking Area must be in compliance at all times with (i) the Staging Area and Parking Area Requirements attached

affiliates  harmless  against  any  and  all  claims,  actions,  liabilities,  damages,  losses,  costs  and  expenses,  including  without  limitation,

otherwise set forth herein) to use and utilize Landlord’s Beltway Parcel Rough Grading Permit (Permit #31822-2011-00), as the same is or
may be modified, amended and or upgraded from time to time (the “ RGP ”).  Landlord shall promptly deliver to Tenant a copy of any
notice of violation from the issuer of the RGP, including any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, received by Landlord or its
affiliates, that relate to the RGP.  As of the date of this First Amendment, the RGP shall be deemed available for use and utilization by
Tenant (the “ Permit Use Date ”), and Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant, at Tenant’s request, to take such commercially  reasonable
steps as may be necessary or appropriate for the RGP to be available for Tenant’s use and utilization as of the Permit Use Date.  Landlord
shall notify Tenant promptly in the event it becomes aware of any additional governmental costs associated with ensuring that the RGP is
available for Tenant’s use.  Unless Tenant notifies Landlord that it no longer desires to utilize the RGP, the additional governmental costs
shall be paid by Tenant, unless Landlord is utilizing the RGP at such time in which case such costs shall be allocated equitably between
Landlord and Tenant in a manner to be determined by Landlord in its reasonable discretion.

Landlord  hereby  grants  permission  to  Tenant  to  use  and  utilize  the  RGP  for  any  and  all  activities  undertaken  on  or  at  the

governmental  authorities  for  approval.    Landlord  shall  approve,  disapprove  or  request  additional  information  regarding  such  proposed
amendment, revision, modification or other change within ten (10) days of receipt of the same from Tenant. Landlord’s consent shall not
be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  or  delayed,  and  may  be  withheld  if  such  amendment,  revision,  modification  or  change  has  a
detrimental effect on Landlord or the other property covered by the RGP or there is an additional cost to Landlord or its affiliates for which

ending  on  the  Permit  Termination  Date,  Tenant  agrees  to  reimburse  Landlord  (or  TPC,  as  the  case  may  be)  for  73.44%  of  the  fees,
premiums or other costs paid by Landlord (or TPC, as the case may be) to maintain the Bonds that correspond to the RGP.  Landlord (or
TPC,  as  the  case  may  be)  shall  deliver  an  invoice  to  Tenant  setting  forth  Tenant’s  73.44%  share  of  the  fees,  premiums  or  other
costs.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord (or TPC, as the case may be) Tenant’s share of the fees within fifteen (15) days after Tenant’s receipt
of such invoice.  Any amounts remaining unpaid after the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period shall bear interest at the rate of 10%
per annum, and Landlord (or TPC, as the case may be) may, in addition, and without notice, impose on Tenant a late charge equal to 10%
of the unpaid amount, which Tenant agrees to promptly pay. In the event Landlord and or TPC seek to obtain the release or reduction of
the Bonds while Tenant is entitled to utilize the RGP, Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord (at no cost to Tenant) in a timely manner
to obtain such release or reduction, but in no event shall Landlord and or TPC undertake any release or reduction that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on Tenant’s work under the RGP.

8.  Reporting  and  Compliance.     Tenant  shall  timely  file  all  reports,  if  any,  required  by  the  Maryland  Department  of  the
Environment National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES General Permit #09 PG0077, as may be modified, amended and or
upgraded from time to time (the “ NPDES Permit ”) in connection with Tenant’s construction activities on the Premises, the Staging Area,
and the Parking Area.  Tenant shall deliver a copy of all such reports to Landlord within one day after Tenant’s filing of such reports.  Any
violations  of  the  NPDES  Permit  by  Tenant  or  its  contractors,  agents,  employees  or  representatives,  or  any  fines  or  fees  imposed  or
remedial work required to be performed, as a result of activities on the Premises, the Staging Area or the Parking Area by Tenant or its
contractors, agents, employees or representatives shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant, and Tenant shall comply with such obligations
in  the  time  frame  required  by  the  applicable  governmental  authorities,  subject  to  Tenant’s  right  to  reasonably  contest  or  appeal  any
governmental orders, so long as such contest or appeal (i) does not impose any costs on Landlord or its affiliates and (ii) cannot reasonably
be expected to jeopardize the good standing status of the RGP or otherwise have a detrimental effect on Landlord or the properties subject
to the RGP.

Tenant shall comply with all rules, regulations, requirements and conditions of the applicable governmental authorities issuing
the  RGP  and  the  NPDES  Permit  (the  RGP  and  NPDES  Permit  are  sometimes  collectively  referred  to  herein  as  the  “  Permits ”).  Any
violations  arising  under  the  RGP  or  the  NPDES  Permit  resulting  from  Tenant’s  use  of  the  Permits  shall  be  addressed  and  corrected
immediately by Tenant, subject to Tenant’s right to reasonably contest or appeal any alleged violations, so long as such contest or appeal
(i) does not impose any costs on Landlord or its affiliates (unless Tenant agrees in writing to pay such costs), (ii) cannot reasonably be
expected to jeopardize the good standing status of the RGP or the NPDES Permit, or (iii) does not otherwise have a detrimental effect on
the ability of Landlord or its affiliates to develop the properties subject to the RGP or the NPDES Permit.   In the event Tenant fails to
remedy any violation (or pay any fine) within the time frame imposed by governmental regulations or authorities, but subject to Tenant’s
right to reasonably contest or appeal any alleged violations (so long as such contest or appeal does not impose any costs on Landlord or its

construction  on  the  Beltway  Parcel  prior  to  completion  of  construction  by  Tenant  and  such  construction  activities  contribute  to  the
decrease in volume of the Pond, then Landlord shall share in a portion of the costs to clean out the Pond which amount shall be agreed
upon by Landlord and Tenant in their reasonable discretion.  After inspection of the Pond by Landlord and Tenant, if Landlord believes in
its  reasonable  discretion  that  there  are  other  damages  to  the  Pond  or  its  surroundings  caused  solely  by  Tenant’s  construction  activities,
Landlord  shall  notify  Tenant  in  writing,  which  writing  shall  specifically  explain  and  describe  any  such  other  damages  to  the  Pond,  and
Tenant  shall  commence  any  necessary  remediation  or  repairs  to  the  Pond  or  other  affected  areas  within  fifteen  (15)  days  of  the  date  of
Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s written notice.  In the event Tenant fails to commence such repairs within the applicable fifteen (15) day
period or thereafter fails to diligently pursue completion of the repairs, Landlord may, at its option, following written notice to Tenant and
the expiration of a period of ten (10) days after such notice, as Tenant’s opportunity to cure, proceed to repair the damages to the Pond or
other  affected  areas.    Landlord  shall  deliver  an  invoice  to  Tenant  for  reimbursement  of  all  reasonable  costs  paid  by  Landlord  for  such
repairs including without limitation reasonable attorney’s fees and costs (the “ Repair Costs ”).  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within
fifteen (15) days after the date of such invoice. The Repair Costs shall constitute Additional Rent under the Lease, subject to late charges
as set forth in Section 4.07 of the Lease.

If,  prior  to  the  completion  of  Tenant’s  construction  activities  on  the  Premises,  Landlord  or  its  affiliates  receive  a  notice  of
violation regarding the Pond or are otherwise required by the applicable governmental authorities to clean out the Pond or perform other
work  to  the  Pond  as  a  result  of  Tenant’s  construction  activities,  Landlord  shall  provide  written  notice  to  Tenant  and  Tenant  shall
commence any necessary remediation or repairs to the Pond or other affected areas within fifteen (15) days of the date of Tenant’s receipt
of Landlord’s written notice.  In the event Tenant fails to commence such work or repairs within the applicable fifteen (15) day period or
thereafter  fails  to  diligently  pursue  completion  of  the  repairs,  Landlord  may,  at  its  option,  following  written  notice  to  Tenant  and  the
expiration of a period of ten (10) days after such notice, as Tenant’s opportunity to cure, proceed to repair the damages to the Pond or other
affected areas.  Landlord shall deliver an invoice to Tenant for reimbursement of all reasonable costs paid by Landlord for such repairs (the
“  Pond  Remediation  Costs  ”).    Tenant  shall  reimburse  Landlord  within  fifteen  (15)  days  after  the  date  of  such  invoice.    The  Pond
Remediation Costs shall constitute Additional Rent under the Lease, subject to late charges as set forth in Section 4.07 of the Lease.

With the cooperation of Landlord and TPC, Tenant agrees to consult and coordinate with TPC’s affiliate, who has responsibility
for  maintaining  the  Pond,  any  of  Tenant’s  work  on  the  Pond.    TPC’s  affiliate  may  not  charge  Tenant  for  such  consultation  and  or
coordination.

Tenant  shall  indemnify,  defend  and  hold  Landlord  and  its  affiliates  harmless  against  any  and  all  Claims  or  Losses,  resulting

from Tenant’s use of the Pond, entry onto the Pond and the land adjacent thereto and Tenant’s performance of work thereon.

10.  Pre-Approval  Fee;  Construction  Commencement  Side  Letter.     Commencing  on  July  23,  2014,  and  continuing  on  the
first day of each month thereafter until such time as the Base Rent Commencement Date (as defined in the Lease) occurs, Tenant shall pay
to Landlord or Landlord’s designee a fee (the “ Pre-Approval Fee ”) in the amount of [***] (such Pre-Approval Fee to be prorated for any
partial  month).  The  Pre-Approval  Fee  shall  be  due  in  advance  on  the  first  day  of  each  month  until  the  Base  Rent  Commencement
Date.  Upon the occurrence of the Base Rent Commencement Date, the Pre-Approval Fee shall terminate.  In the event Tenant is required
by  the  applicable  governmental  authorities  to  stop  construction  on  the  Premises  as  a  result  of  Landlord’s  failure  to  perform  Landlord’s
Matters  (as that  term  is defined  below),  the obligation  of Tenant  to pay the Pre-Approval  Fee  shall  cease  until  such  date  that  Tenant  is
permitted  and  able  to  recommence  construction  activities  on  the  Premises.    In  lieu  of  the  payment  of  the  Pre-Approval  Fee  by  Tenant,
Landlord  may  request  in  writing  that  Tenant  provide  to  Landlord  a  credit  equal  to  the  total  Pre-Approval  Fee  due  hereunder  against
amounts owed to Tenant by Landlord under the Circle Road Declaration (as hereinafter defined). The parties acknowledge that Landlord
and Tenant entered into a 2-page construction commencement side letter agreement on TPC letterhead dated June 4, 2014, as amended by
letter agreement dated June 20, 2014, and as further amended by letter agreement dated June 27, 2014, and as further amended by letter
agreement dated July 17, 2014 (collectively, the “ Construction Commencement Side Letter ”).  Upon execution of this First Amendment
by Landlord and Tenant, the Construction Commencement Side Letter shall be deemed terminated, and shall be superseded in its entirety
by the terms in this First Amendment.

11.  Approval

 Date;

 Landlord  Matters.

 Under

 the  Lease  Landlord  agreed  to  pursue  the  Land  Use

Entitlements.    However,  Tenant  has  elected  to  assume  responsibility  for  Tenant’s  DSP  Modification  and  Landlord  agrees  to  such
assumption of responsibility subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  As a result, Tenant’s right to terminate the Lease as set
forth  in  Section  3.03  of  the  Lease  is  hereby  waived  by  Tenant.    As  of  the  Effective  Date,  the  remaining  Land  Use  Entitlements  to  be
satisfied by Landlord are the following:  (i) the creation of the Permanent Easement Areas, the Dedication  Areas, and the Abandonment
Areas which the Landlord is pursuing as set forth in Paragraph 3 above, as depicted on the MSHA Site Plan, to be resolved by and with
MSHA relative to the Premises in such a manner as to allow Tenant the unconditional right to construct the Tenant Improvements and to
operate Tenant’s business activities within the Tenant’s Improvements on such property during the Term of the Lease, including providing
Tenant with immediate and full access, entry and construction rights until such resolutions have occurred, or such other  resolution of the
MSHA  easement  and  right  of  way  areas  as  Landlord  shall  reasonably  determine  so  long  as  such  resolution  provides  to  Tenant  the
unconditional,  perpetual  right  to  construct  the  Tenant  Improvements,  to  operate  Tenant’s  business  activities  within  the  Tenant’s
Improvements, and to fully access the Premises in such a manner as to permit Tenant’s title company to insure Tenant’s perpetual rights
under Tenant’s title insurance policy; (ii) any and all Archaeological and or Historical Preservation issues and matters associated with or
related to The Addison Family Cemetery Historic Site located on the Remaining Beltway Parcel, including the satisfaction of condition no.
12 of Tenant’s Detailed Site Plan, which requires that evidence be provided that the six interpretive plaques required by Stipulation II.C of
the  Memorandum  of  Agreement  executed  between  the  Maryland  Department  of  the  Environment,  the  Maryland  Historic  Trust  and  the
Peterson Companies, and by Condition No. 30 of SP-98012, have been installed by the end of 2014; and (iii) any and all TCP II (aka tree
mitigation/preservation/conservation)  issues  and  matters.    Upon  completion  and  satisfaction  by  Landlord  of  the  foregoing  Land  Use
Entitlements,  and  provided  that  no  other  matters  remain  outstanding  or  unfulfilled  that  (y)  constitute  Land  Use  Entitlements  under  the
Lease and (z) are not associated with Tenant’s DSP Modification or any future modifications or any other commitments made by Tenant,
the “Approval Date,” as that term is defined and used in the Lease, shall be deemed to have occurred.

In addition, Landlord also agrees to be responsible for the following obligations (collectively referred to, along with the Land Use

Entitlements, as the “ Landlord Matters ”):

a.

b.

c.

any and all issues and matters relating in any manner to sidewalks and walkways on the Remaining Beltway Parcel as
required by the applicable governmental authorities as more particularly set forth in Section 15 hereof (excluding any
sidewalks and walkways on the Premises, any other sidewalk or walkways required by governmental authorities for Tenant
to open the Tenant Improvements, and any sidewalks or walkways requiring repair or replacement as a result of Tenant’s
construction activities);
any and all issues and matters relating in any manner to directional or wayfinding signs and signage on and throughout the
Beltway Parcel that are Landlord’s obligation as set forth in Section 16 hereof; and
any and all other duties and obligations of Landlord (and TPC, as the case may be) with regard to the Bonds and the RGP
as set forth herein.

Landlord agrees to promptly and diligently pursue the resolution, performance and satisfaction of all of the Landlord Matters (at
Landlord’s cost) in compliance with all Laws.  Landlord agrees to keep Tenant informed on a regular basis (at least monthly or more often
if requested by Tenant) of Landlord’s efforts to resolve, perform and satisfy the Landlord Matters.

In the event that Landlord fails to perform any of its obligations that relate to the Landlord Matters, and such failure could

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Tenant’s construction or the opening of the Tenant Improvements to the public
or Tenant’s ongoing operations (to be determined in Tenant’s reasonable judgment), Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing, which writing
shall specifically explain and describe such failures by Landlord and the material adverse effect that such failure will have on Tenant’s
construction or the opening of the Tenant Improvements to the public or ongoing operations, and Landlord shall commence to cure the
failure within fifteen (15) days of the date of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s written notice.  In the event Landlord fails to commence such
cure within the applicable fifteen (15) day period or thereafter fails to diligently pursue completion of the cure, Tenant may, at its option,
following written notice to Landlord and the expiration of a period of ten (10) days after such notice, as Landlord’s opportunity to cure,
proceed to perform such obligations on Landlord’s behalf.  Tenant shall deliver an invoice to Landlord for reimbursement of all reasonable
costs paid by Tenant in connection with such performance or performance attempted in good faith, including reasonable attorneys’ fees
and court costs, if any.  Landlord shall reimburse Tenant within fifteen (15) days after the date of such invoice.  Any amounts remaining
unpaid after the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum.

12. Street Naming .  Landlord and Tenant shall, in good faith, from time to time, mutually agree upon the names of all of

the roads, roadways and streets located within the overall development for the Beltway Parcel that are major access roads to the Beltway
Parcel, including those immediately adjacent to or fronting the Premises (including the road that Landlord and Tenant tentatively refer to
as Circle Road), or any portion thereof, and any changes thereto and shall work together to obtain MSHA approval of such names.  The
parties shall execute and deliver any appropriate papers that may be necessary and shall further cooperate as necessary in connection
thereto.  The parties further agree on the following names:

a) Harborview Boulevard shall be named, known as, and identified at all times as “MGM Boulevard” or if “MGM

Boulevard” is not acceptable to the governmental authorities another name containing the letters “MGM” to be agreed
upon by Landlord and Tenant;

b) North Road shall be named, known as, and identified at all times as “Monument Boulevard”; and
c) West Road shall be named, known as, and identified at all times as “Vista Way”.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, if the name Vista Way is not available, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually

agree upon an alternative name.

13. Circle Road Declaration.   From and after the Effective Date, Landlord and Tenant shall diligently and in good faith negotiate and

cause to be executed and recorded a Declaration of Easements, Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (the “ Circle Road Declaration ”)
that addresses the construction and maintenance of the Circle Road to be constructed by Tenant on the easterly boundary of the Premises
and the westerly boundary of the property adjacent to the Premises.

14. Road Improvements.   Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that certain improvements must be made to:

a) West Road (“West Road Improvements”);
b)

that portion of existing Oxon Hill Road south of Bald Eagle Road and north of Harborview Avenue which
improvements  have been conceptually approved by MSHA and are currently under design by Soltesz and do not include
any improvements required as a result of Tenant’s detailed site plan (the “Oxon Hill Road Improvements”);
the traffic signalization at the intersection of Oxon Hill Road and National Avenue (“Traffic Signal Improvements”); and
the National Avenue/Harbor View one-way reconfiguration (“One-Way Reconfiguration”). (The West Road
Improvements, the Oxon Hill Road Improvements, the Traffic Signal Improvements and the One-Way Reconfiguration are
sometimes referred to herein collectively as the “ Road Improvements ”).

c)
d)

Landlord and Tenant agree to work together in good faith, and to coordinate  the timing, for the construction,  completion  and
opening of the Road Improvements to the public on or before the scheduled opening to the public of the Tenant Improvements (it being the
intent  and  agreement  of  the  parties  to  coordinate  the  timing  of  the  construction  of  the  Road  Improvements  in  order  to  avoid  the  early
completion  of  Road  Improvements  so  that  Tenant  does  not  risk  damaging  the  Road  Improvements  during  the  construction  of  Tenant’s
Improvements).

The cost of the design and construction of the West Road Improvements shall be shared equally between Landlord and Tenant.
The design and construction of the Oxon Hill Road Improvements shall be at the sole cost and expense of Landlord or TPC provided that
any improvements to Oxon Hill Road required as a result of Tenant’s detailed site plan shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant. The cost
of Traffic  Signal  Improvements  (if required  by governmental  authorities  in connection  with the opening  of Tenant’s  Hotel & Casino  (“
Tenant’s  Opening  Date  ”))  and  the  One-Way  Reconfiguration  including  design,  construction  and  installation  shall  be  the  sole  cost  and
expense of Tenant.  If the Traffic Signal Improvements are not required prior to Tenant’s Opening Date but are required within five (5)
years after Tenant’s Opening Date, then Tenant shall pay one-half of the cost of the Traffic Signal Improvements.  Tenant shall design the
West  Road  Improvements  and  shall  obtain  the  approval  of  Landlord  (which  approval  may  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,  delayed  or
conditioned) for such design prior to submission to the applicable governmental authorities for approval.  Tenant shall provide Landlord
with  periodic  updates  (no  less  frequently  than  monthly)  regarding  the  West  Road  Improvements  and  the  design,  approval  and  cost
thereof.  Provided that Landlord has approved

the  design  and  cost  of  the  West  Road  Improvements,  Landlord  shall  provide  the  land  needed  for  the  construction  of  the  West  Road
Improvements.  Landlord and Tenant agree that the West Road Improvements shall be designed to public road standards but the parties’
goal  is  retain  West  Road  as  a  private  road  if  permitted  by  the  applicable  governmental  authorities  and  Landlord  and  Tenant  shall  work
together to achieve such goal.  Landlord and Tenant shall each provide the other with sufficient advance notice of any meetings between
either party or its representatives and the governmental authorities regarding any of the Road Improvements so that the other party may
attend such meetings. Any additional improvements required by governmental authorities as a result of the Traffic Management Plan dated
May 7, 2014, and the Traffic Impact Study (version 6) dated April 30, 2014, to the roadways in and around the Beltway Parcel shall be
made  by  Tenant  at  Tenant’s  sole  cost  and  expense.    Tenant  shall  have  the  right  to  reasonably  contest  or  appeal  any  changes  or
improvements  required  to  be  made  by  governmental  authorities,  so  long  as  such  contest  or  appeal  (i)  does  not  impose  any  costs  on
Landlord  or its affiliates  (unless Tenant agrees in writing to pay such costs), and (ii) cannot reasonably  be expected  to have an adverse
effect on Landlord.

15.  Sidewalks  and  Walkways.     Tenant  agrees  to  pay  for  (i)  the  costs  of  designing,  constructing  and  maintaining  all
sidewalks  and  walkways  on  the  Premises  and  the  Permanent  Easement  Areas  (including  those  required  by  Tenant’s  detailed  site  plan
and/or  by MSHA), and (ii) the costs of designing  and constructing  all sidewalks  and walkways  on the remainder  of the Beltway  Parcel
required by governmental authorities for the opening of the Tenant Improvements to the public, including those required by condition item
no. 1(u) of the Tenant’s Detailed Site Plan DSP-07073-01.  Landlord agrees to pay for the costs of designing, constructing and, in the event
not  designated  as  a  Common  Area  of  Responsibility  (as  hereinafter  defined),  maintaining  all  sidewalks  and  walkways  required  by
applicable governmental authorities on the Remaining Beltway Parcel as required by Landlord’s detailed site plan.  Sidewalks designated
as Common Areas of Responsibility in the Declaration (as hereinafter defined) shall be maintained by the association established as part of
the  Declaration.      Landlord  and  Tenant  agree  to  work  together  in  good  faith,  and  to  coordinate  the  timing,  for  the  construction  and
completion of sidewalks and walkways (it being the intent and agreement of the parties to coordinate the timing of the construction of the
sidewalks and walkways in order to avoid the early completion of the sidewalks and walkways so that Tenant does not risk damaging them
during the construction of Tenant’s Improvements). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any existing sidewalks located on or adjacent to the
Beltway Parcel that are damaged or destroyed by Tenant or its contractors during Tenant’s construction activities shall be expeditiously
repaired and/or replaced by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost.  If Tenant fails to so repair or replace such existing sidewalks, then Landlord shall
have the right, after providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to Tenant regarding Tenant’s failure to repair or replace such existing
sidewalk and Tenant’s failure to commence and diligently pursue such repair or replacement, to repair or replace such sidewalk and send
an  invoice  to  Tenant  for  reimbursement  of  all  reasonable  costs  paid  by  Landlord  to  repair  of  replace  the  sidewalk  including  reasonable
attorneys’ fees and court costs, if any (the “ Sidewalk Costs ”).  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within fifteen (15) days after the date of
such invoice.  The Sidewalk Costs shall constitute Additional Rent under the Lease, subject to late charges as set forth in Section 4.07 of
the Lease.

issues  and  matters  relating  to  directional  and/or  wayfinding  signs  and  signage  on  the  Beltway  Parcel  (including  reasonable  signs  and
signage  to  be  located  on  the  Remaining  Beltway  Parcel  that  relate  directly  to  the  Premises  and  to  Tenant’s  businesses  and  Tenant’s
Improvements,  parking,  and  events),  including  the  cost  and  quality  of  signs  and  signage,  and  in  satisfying  all  applicable  laws  and
requirements relating thereto, and obtaining all necessary or desirable permits, consents and authorizations. Landlord agrees to allow the
placement,  construction,  and  installation  of  signs  and  signage  on  the  remainder  of  the  Beltway  Parcel,  and  the  maintenance,  repair  and
replacement (as reasonably necessary) thereof, of such directional and or wayfinding signs and signage as may be required by applicable
laws  and  as  may  reasonably  be  determined  by  Landlord  and  Tenant,  including  reasonable  signs  and  signage  that  relate  directly  to  the
Premises and to Tenant’s businesses and Tenant’s Improvements, parking, and events.  Landlord and Tenant shall agree upon final design,
materials, location and cost for such signs and signage, and Landlord and Tenant shall work together, in good faith, to determine a cost-
sharing arrangement between Landlord and Tenant for payment of the costs of the signs and signage that relates directly to the Premises on
the remainder of the Beltway Parcel, based on a fair and equitable allocation of such costs provided that all signs and signage to be located
on the Premises shall be at the sole cost and expense of Tenant, and Tenant’s share of the signage that relates directly to the Premises on
the Remaining Beltway Parcel shall be at least 50%.

removal of property in excess of 20% of the Beltway Parcel that is not part of the Premises, in any single event or in the aggregate at any
time, without Tenant’s prior written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (ii) achieving an
allocation of costs under the Declaration to the owner of the Ground Lease Parcel (as defined in the Declaration and intended to be the
same  land  as  the  Premises)  that  is  mutually  acceptable  to  Landlord  and  Tenant;  (iii)  agreement  on  initial  budget  for  first  year  of
construction  activities  of  the  Association  (as  defined  in  the  Declaration)  and  an  initial  budget  of  the  Association  for  the  first  year  of
operations with Tenant having reasonable approval rights in the event of more than a 5% increase year over year; (iv) the establishment of
prior reasonable approval rights for Tenant in the event that Tenant is required to pay for or contribute to costs of services provided by the

G

modified, as necessary, in order to address and accommodate the final Circle Road configuration or other road configuration for the road to
be constructed on the easterly boundary of the Premises and the westerly boundary of the property adjacent to the Premises (or any portion
thereof) and the specific entry and exit street and road locations.  The parties agree to work together in good faith to facilitate and complete

Dear Jon,

Enclosed, please find the Executive Drawing Update Package at 50% DD as well as a Signage Package. The packages are subject to change, but we believe them to be
sufficient to serve as the “Approved Master Plan” referenced in the lease, specifically for the purposes of determining the expansion limitations set forth in Section 3.01(a)
of the lease.

Also, please note that the plans show the Circle Road between the MGM/TPC properties which of course will be subject to agreement on the easement, build-out and
maintenance of the Circle Road.

I plan to be in National Harbor next week and look forward to reviewing these in person with you and your team.

Sincerely,

/s/ Hunter Clayton

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULATION
AND
LICENSING

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject to
extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located.  These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility,
financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations.  Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result
in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

In  addition  to  gaming  regulations,  our  businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  and  local  laws  and  regulations  of  the  countries  and  states  in  which  we
operate.    These  laws  and  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  restrictions  and  conditions  concerning  alcoholic  beverages,  smoking,  environmental  matters,
employment and immigration, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, land use, marketing and advertising, timeshare, lending, privacy, telemarketing,
regulations applicable under the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Such
laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.  Any material changes, new laws or
regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Nevada
Government
Regulation

The ownership and operation of our casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively,  the  “Nevada  Act”),  and  various  local  regulations.    Our  gaming  operations  are  subject  to  the  licensing  and  regulatory  control  of  the  Nevada  Gaming
Commission  (the  “Nevada  Commission”),  the  Nevada  State  Gaming  Control  Board  (the  “Nevada  Board”),  and  various  county  and  city  licensing  agencies  (the  “local
authorities”).  The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

The laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among

other things:

•

•

•

•

•

•

the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices;

the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs
and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;

providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and

providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

Any change in the laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations.

Each of our subsidiaries that currently operate casinos in Nevada (collectively, the “Nevada casino licensees”) is required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming
Authorities.  Each gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable.  MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New York Hotel & Casino,
LLC,  Bellagio,  LLC,  MGM  Resorts  Manufacturing  Corp.,  and  Aria  Resort  &  Casino,  LLC  are  also  licensed  as  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  gaming  devices
(collectively, the “Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees”).  Certain of our subsidiaries have also been licensed or found suitable as shareholders, members, or
general partners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees.  The Nevada casino licensees, Nevada manufacturer
and distributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.”

We,  along  with  Mandalay  Resort  Group,  are  required  to  be  registered  by  the  Nevada  Commission  as  publicly  traded  corporations  (collectively,  the  “Nevada
registered corporations”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodically  to
submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada

Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require.  No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage
of profits from, the Nevada licensed subsidiaries without first registering with (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada
Gaming Authorities.  Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any
corporation controlling a gaming licensee.  The Nevada registered corporations, Mirage Resorts, Incorporated and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries have obtained from the
Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits, and licenses required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.

The  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  may  investigate  any  individual  who  has  a  material  relationship  to,  or  material  involvement  with,  the  Nevada  registered
corporations  or  any  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  to  determine  whether  such  individual  is  suitable  or  should  be  licensed  as  a  business  associate  of  a  gaming
licensee.    Officers,  directors,  and  certain  key  employees  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  must  file  applications  with  the  Nevada  Gaming  Authorities  and  may  be
required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  Officers, directors, and key employees of the Nevada registered corporations who are actively and directly
involved in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  The Nevada
Gaming  Authorities  may  deny  an  application  for  licensing  or  a  finding  of  suitability  for  any  cause  they  deem  reasonable.    A  finding  of  suitability  is  comparable  to
licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation.  The applicant for licensing or a finding of
suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation.  Changes in licensed
positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada
Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the Nevada
registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would have to sever all
relationships with that person.  In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to terminate the
employment  of any person who refuses to file appropriate  applications.   Determinations  of suitability  or of questions pertaining  to licensing  are not subject to judicial
review in Nevada.

The  Nevada  registered  corporations  and  the  Nevada  casino  licensees  are  required  to  submit  detailed  financial  and  operating  reports  to  the  Nevada
Commission.  Substantially all of the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similar financing
transactions must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission.

If the Nevada Commission determined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subject to
compliance  with  certain  statutory  and  regulatory  procedures,  our  gaming  licenses  and  those  of  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries.    In  addition,  the  Nevada  registered
corporations  and  the  Nevada  licensed  subsidiaries  and  the  persons  involved  could  be  subject  to  substantial  fines  for  each  separate  violation  of  the  Nevada  Act  at  the
discretion  of  the  Nevada  Commission.    Further,  a  supervisor  could  be  appointed  by  the  Nevada  Commission  to  operate  the  gaming  establishments  and,  under  certain
circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to the State
of  Nevada.    Limitation,  conditioning,  or  suspension  of  any  gaming  license  or  the  appointment  of  a  supervisor  could  (and  revocation  of  any  gaming  license  would)
materially adversely affect our gaming operations.

Any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her
suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent
with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.  The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such
investigation.

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.  The
Nevada  Act  requires  that  beneficial  owners  of  more  than  10%  of  any  class  of  our  voting  securities  apply  to  the  Nevada  Commission  for  a  finding  of  suitability
within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing.  Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as defined in
the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such
finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may, in
certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.

An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course of
business as an institutional  investor  and not for  the purpose of  causing,  directly  or indirectly,  the election  of  a majority  of the members  of our  board of directors,  any
change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies, or

2

operations,  or  any  of  our  gaming  affiliates,  or  any  other  action  that  the  Nevada  Commission  finds  to  be  inconsistent  with  holding  our  voting  securities  for  investment
purposes only.  Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

•

•

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders;

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in
its management, policies, or operations; and

such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If  the  beneficial  holder  of  voting  securities  who  must  be  found  suitable  is  a  corporation,  partnership,  or  trust,  it  must  submit  detailed  business  and  financial

information including a list of beneficial owners.  The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the
Chairman of the Nevada Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation of its
application,  may  be  found  unsuitable.    The  same  restrictions  apply  to  a  record  owner  if  the  record  owner,  after  request,  fails  to  identify  the  beneficial  owner.    Any
stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the
Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense.  We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder
or to have any other relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries:

•

•

•

•

pays that person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;

allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;

pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchase of
the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of the Nevada registered corporations to file an application, be investigated,
and be found suitable to hold the debt security.  If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act,
the registered corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it:

•

•

•

•

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever;

recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction.

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time.  If any securities are held in
trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  A failure to make
such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable.  We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial
owner.  The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that such securities are subject
to the Nevada Act.  However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations.

The Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or the
proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for
similar purposes.  An approval, if given, does not

3

constitute a finding, recommendation, or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment
merits of the securities.  Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

On July 24, 2014, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years, subject

to certain conditions.

Changes in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any
act or conduct by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.  Entities seeking to acquire control of a
registered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of the registered
corporation.  The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with
the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities, and corporate defensive tactics
affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming.  The
Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to
further Nevada’s policy to:

•

•

•

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the current
market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.  The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization
proposed  by  a  registered  corporation’s  board  of  directors  in  response  to  a  tender  offer  made  directly  to  the  registered  corporation’s  stockholders  for  the  purpose  of
acquiring control of that corporation.

License  fees  and  taxes,  computed  in  various  ways  depending  on  the  type  of  gaming  or  activity  involved,  are  payable  to  the  State  of  Nevada  and  to  the  local

authorities.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either:

•

•

•

a percentage of the gross revenues received;

the number of gaming devices operated; or

the number of table games operated.

The tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%.  A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of live

entertainment are provided.  The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.

Because we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the
amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming.  The revolving fund is subject to increase or
decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act.  We
would be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we:

•

•

knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

4

•

•

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or
tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

employ, contract with, or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the
ground of personal unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

The sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities.  All licenses
are revocable and are not transferable.  The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend, or revoke any such license, and any such disciplinary action
could (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.

Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act (the “Michigan Act”) subjects the owners and operators of casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensing
and regulatory requirements.  The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such local ordinances
regulating casino gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.  We are subject to the Michigan Act through our ownership interest
in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (the “licensed subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit.  Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is held by our wholly-
owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.

The Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than three applicants
who have entered into development agreements with the City of Detroit.  The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct background investigations and
determine the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated companies and persons
or  entities  holding  a  one  percent  or  greater  direct  or  indirect  interest  in  an  applicant  or  affiliated  company.    Institutional  investors  holding  less  than  certain  specified
amounts  of  our  debt  or  equity  securities  are  exempted  from  meeting  the  suitability  requirements  of  the  Michigan  Act  since  we  are  a  publicly  traded  corporation,  and
provided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs.  Any person who supplies goods or
services to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person who supplies other goods or services to the
licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board.  In addition, any individual employed by the licensed
subsidiary or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performed in a restricted area or a gaming area of the
licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license.  The applicant must
establish  its  suitability  as  to  integrity,  moral  character  and  reputation,  business  probity,  financial  ability  and  experience,  responsibility,  and  other  criteria  deemed
appropriate  by  the  Michigan  Board.    A  casino  license  is  valid  for  a  period  of  one  year  and  the  Michigan  Board  may  refuse  to  renew  it  upon  a  determination  that  the
licensee no longer meets the requirements for licensure.

The Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license.  The licensed subsidiary is also subject to fines
or  forfeiture  of  assets  for  violations  of  gaming  or  liquor  control  laws  or  rules.    In  the  event  that  the  licensed  subsidiary’s  license  is  revoked  or  suspended  for  more
than  120  days,  the  Michigan  Act  provides  for  the  appointment  of  a  conservator  who,  among  other  things,  is  required  to  preserve  the  assets  to  ensure  that  they  shall
continue to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person or entity who
meets the requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations.

The  Michigan  Board  has  adopted  administrative  rules  to  implement  the  terms  of  the  Michigan  Act.    Among  other  things,  the  rules  impose  more  detailed

substantive and procedural requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations.

Included are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the Michigan Board,
internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership interests in
licensed casinos.  The rules also establish numerous

5

Michigan Board procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary and other hearings, and similar matters.  The rules have the force of law and are binding on the Michigan
Board as well as on applicants for or holders of casino licenses.

Under rules of the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly traded company
which is the holding company of a Michigan casino licensee must obtain approval of the acquisition from the Michigan Board.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the person
or company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified”  to own the shares.  In addition, if the acquisition is by a
company, “key persons” in the company (generally the officers, directors, managerial employees, and significant owners) must also be determined to be “suitable” and
“qualified.” “Institutional investors” (as that term is defined in the Michigan Act) may generally obtain a waiver from these requirements if the institutional investor has
less  than  15%  ownership  interest  in  the  publicly  traded  company.   Upon attaining  equity  ownership  of  5%  or  more,  or  filing  Schedule  13D  or  13G with  the  SEC, the
Michigan Board must be notified by the investor.  Unless otherwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutional investors acquiring less than 10% equity ownership in the
publicly  traded  company  are  entitled  to  an  exemption  from  the  approval  requirements,  but  are  required  to  file  an  institutional  waiver  application  with  the  Michigan
Board.    Institutional  investors  acquiring  10%  or  more  equity  ownership  must  apply  for  an  institutional  waiver,  supplying  certain  information  delineated  in
Rule 504(3).  Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership must apply to the Michigan Board for approval of the acquisition
within 45 days after it occurs.  The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitability and qualification determinations.

The  term  “institutional  investor”  includes  financial  institutions,  insurance  companies,  pension  funds,  mutual  funds,  etc.    The  shares  held  by  the  institutional
investor must be held for investment purposes only.  The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes:  voting by proxy
furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities; serving as a member of a committee of creditors or security holders
formed  in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;  nominating  a  candidate  for  election  or  appointment  to  the  board  of  directors  in  connection  with  a  debt  restructuring;
accepting appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the
member’s term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purposes and not to cause a change
in its management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent.

The  Michigan  Liquor  Control  Commission  licenses,  controls  and  regulates  the  sale  of  alcoholic  beverages  by  the  licensed  subsidiary  pursuant  to  the  Michigan

Liquor Control Code of 1998.  The Michigan Act also requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Code.

The Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.”  The
ordinance authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which has been approved and
certified  by  the  City  Council  and  is  currently  in  effect,  or  are  acting  on  behalf  of  such  parties.    The  development  agreement  among  the  City  of  Detroit,  MGM  Grand
Detroit, LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect.  Under the ordinance, the
licensed subsidiary is required to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding its compliance with the development agreement or, in
the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply.  The ordinance requires the Mayor of Detroit to monitor each casino
operator’s  compliance  with  its  development  agreement,  to  take  appropriate  enforcement  action  in  the  event  of  default  and  to  notify  the  City  Council  of  defaults  and
enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of such action to the Michigan Board within five
business days along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license.  If a development agreement is terminated, the Michigan
Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit.

The administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization or financial

viability of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino.  Proceeds of the
wagering tax are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit.  In addition to the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annual municipal service
fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment, as adjusted
annually based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount of approximately $8.3 million to be paid to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement and other
casino-related costs.  These payments are in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments customarily paid by business entities situated in Detroit.  The licensed subsidiary is
also obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to Detroit, to be increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in any calendar year in which adjusted gross receipts
exceed $400 million.

Mississippi
Government
Regulation

We conduct our Mississippi gaming operations through two indirect subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., LLC operates Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi, and
MGM  Resorts  Mississippi,  Inc.,  which  operates  the  Gold  Strike  Casino  in  Tunica  County,  Mississippi  (collectively,  the  “casino  licensees”).    The  operation  of  casino
facilities in Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the
Mississippi Department of Revenue.

The Mississippi Gaming Control Act (the “Mississippi Act”) legalized casino gaming in Mississippi.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations in

furtherance of the Mississippi Act.  The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;

maintain effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding of
assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission;

prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;

provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and

ensure that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents.

The  regulations  are  subject  to  amendment  and  interpretation  by  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.    Changes  in  Mississippi  law  or  the  regulations  or  the
Mississippi Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have a material
adverse effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if the
voters in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county.  As of December 31, 2016, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the state
and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties.  Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi law
required that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the waters of the State of
Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the law became effective which
allowed gaming facilities to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities is located more than 800 feet from the
mean high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound.  The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-gaming facilities.  The law permits unlimited
stakes gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the percentage of space which may be utilized
for gaming.  There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi.

The casino licensees are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Gaming licenses require the periodic payment of
fees and taxes and are not transferable.  Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter.  The current license of
Beau Rivage Resorts, LLC is effective through April 20, 2019 and the current license of MGM Resorts Mississippi, Inc. is effective through June 22, 2018.

We are registered by the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees.  As a registered
publicly traded corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodically submit detailed
financial,  operating  and  other  reports  to  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  and  furnish  any  other  information  which  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  may
require.    If  we  are  unable  to  satisfy  the  registration  requirements  of  the  Mississippi  Act,  we  and  our  casino  licensees  cannot  own  or  operate  gaming  facilities  in
Mississippi.  The casino licensees are also required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the
Mississippi Department of Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby.  With certain exceptions, no person may become a stockholder of or receive any
percentage of profits from the casino licensees without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

7

Certain of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We believe that we have applied
for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file
applications for findings of suitability.  In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found suitable, in which case
those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation.  A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personal and financial information
followed by a thorough investigation.  There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be found suitable by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that it deems reasonable.  Findings of suitability
must be periodically renewed.

Changes in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding of
suitability, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to
require us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom
the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities.

Employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to issue a
work permit to a person convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed various misdemeanors or
knowingly violated the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause.

At any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to investigate and require a finding of suitability of any of our record or beneficial stockholders,
regardless  of  the  percentage  of  ownership.    Mississippi  law  requires  any  person  who  acquires  more  than  5%  of  our  voting  securities  to  report  the  acquisition  to  the
Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable.  Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more than 10% of our voting
securities, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  An applicant for finding of
suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation.

The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  generally  exercised  its  discretion  to  require  a  finding  of  suitability  of  any  beneficial  owner  of  more  than  5%  of  a
registered  public  or  private  company’s  voting  securities.    However,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  has  adopted  a  regulation  that  permits  certain  institutional
investors  to  own  beneficially  up  to  15%  and,  under  certain  circumstances,  up  to  19%,  of  a  registered  or  licensed  company’s  voting  securities  without  a  finding  of
suitability.  Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a waiver
of a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of a registered or
licensed company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment
purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly
or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change in the registered or licensed company’s
corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the
Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.

Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

voting,  directly  or  indirectly  through  the  delivery  of  a  proxy furnished  by  the  board  of  directors,  on all  matters  voted  upon by the holders  of  such  voting
securities;

serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring;

nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring;

accepting appointment or election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt
restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term;

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in
management, policies or operations; and

such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

8

If a stockholder  who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership  or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information  including a list of
beneficial owners.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered public
company’s equity interests for any cause it deems reasonable.

We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities.  In addition,
under the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigate the holders, and
require the holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities.

Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found suitable,
the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  retains  the  discretion  to  do  so  for  any  reason,  including  but  not  limited  to  a  default,  or  where  the  holder  of  the  debt  instrument
exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question.  Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of suitability must pay all
investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming Commission
may  be  found  unsuitable.    Any  person  found  unsuitable  and  who  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  beneficial  ownership  of  our  securities  beyond  the  time  that  the
Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.  After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holder of our debt
securities or to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we:

•

•

•

•

•

pay the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or other distribution whatsoever;

recognize the exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person;

pay the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances;

make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of
the securities for cash at a fair market value.

The casino licensees must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity securities and we must maintain in Mississippi a
current list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us.  The ledger and stockholder lists
must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time.  If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record
holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial  owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  A failure to make that disclosure may be grounds for
finding the record holder unsuitable.  We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

The  Mississippi  Act  requires  that  the  certificates  representing  securities  of  a  registered  publicly  traded  corporation  bear  a  legend  to  the  general  effect  that  the
securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted
us a waiver of this legend requirement.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our securities at any
time.

Substantially  all  loans,  leases,  sales  of  securities  and  similar  financing  transactions  by  the  casino  licensees  must  be  reported  to  or  approved  by  the  Mississippi
Gaming Commission.  The licensed subsidiaries may not make a public offering of their securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities with the prior approval of
the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission if any part
of  the  proceeds  of  the  offering  is  to  be  used  to  finance  the  construction,  acquisition  or  operation  of  gaming  facilities  in  Mississippi  or  to  retire  or  extend  obligations
incurred for those purposes.  The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment
merits of the securities subject to the offering.  Effective June 23, 2015, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of the prior approval requirement for our
securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions.  The waiver may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an
interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Under  the  regulations  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission,  the  casino  licensees  may  not  guarantee  a  security  issued  by  us  pursuant  to  a  public  offering,  or
pledge their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission.  Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interests foreclose on
such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by us and agreements
not  to  encumber  such  securities  granted  by  us  are  ineffective  without  the  prior  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.    The  waiver  of  the  prior  approval
requirement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the prior approval requirement for
such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions.

We  cannot  change  our  control  through  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of  assets,  management  or  consulting  agreements  or  any  form  of  takeover  without  the
prior  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.    The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  may  also  require  controlling  stockholders,  officers,  directors,  and  other
persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating
to the transaction.

The Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defensive
tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be injurious to
stable and productive corporate gaming.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these
business practices upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates,
preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form, and promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

We may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess of
the  current  market  price  of  its  common  stock  (commonly  called  “greenmail”)  or  before  we  may  consummate  a  corporate  acquisition  opposed  by  management.    The
regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board of Directors opposing a tender
offer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us.

Neither we nor the casino licensees may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associated
with  the  gaming  license  of  the  casino  licensees  conduct  gaming  operations  outside  of  Mississippi  without  approval  of  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission.    The
Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it have access to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, out-of-state gaming operations.  We believe that we
have applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gaming operations
outside of Mississippi.

If the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that the casino licensees violated  a gaming law or regulation,  the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit,
condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary.  In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each
separate violation.  A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaming license.

Because  of  a  violation,  the  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  could  attempt  to  appoint  a  supervisor  to  operate  the  casino  facilities.    Limitation,  conditioning  or
suspension of the casino licensees’ gaming license or our registration as a publicly traded holding company, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and the revocation
of any gaming license or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations.

The casino licensees must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to the
county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either
monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the number of table
games operated by the casino.

The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gross revenues,” generally defined as cash receipts less cash payouts to customers as winnings,
and generally equals 8% of gross revenue.  These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid.  The gross revenue fee
imposed  by  the  Mississippi  cities  and  counties  in  which  casino  operations  are  located  is  in  addition  to  the  fees  payable  to  the  State  of  Mississippi  and  equals
approximately 4% of gross revenue.

The  Mississippi  Gaming  Commission  adopted  a  regulation  in  1994  requiring  as  a  condition  of  licensure  or  license  renewal  that  a  gaming  establishment’s  plan

include a 500-car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities

10

which will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost.  Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park, golf
course  and  other  similar  facilities.    Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  are  in  compliance  with  this  requirement.    On  January  21,  1999,  the  Mississippi  Gaming
Commission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%; however, the regulation grandfathers
existing licensees and applies only to new casino projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would therefore not apply to Beau
Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica.  In any event, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica would comply with such requirement.  On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission adopted further amendments to this regulation to impose additional requirements on new casino projects.  However, the amended regulation grandfathers any
licensee  who has been licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December  31, 2013; therefore,  the amendments do not apply to Beau Rivage or Gold
Strike Tunica.

Both  the  local  jurisdiction  and  the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Division  of  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Revenue  license,  control  and  regulate  the  sale  of
alcoholic beverages by the casino licensees.  Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located therein to
serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis.  The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ key officers
and  managers  and  all  owners  of  more  than  5%  of  the  casino  licensees’  equity  submit  detailed  personal,  and  in  some  instances,  financial  information  to  the  Alcoholic
Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed.  All such licenses are non-transferable.  The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the full power to limit,
condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions.  Any disciplinary action
could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.

Illinois
Government
Regulation

Our 50% joint venture ownership interest in Grand Victoria Riverboat Casino, located in Elgin, Illinois (“Grand Victoria”) is subject to extensive state regulation

under the Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) and the regulations of the Illinois Gaming Board (the “Illinois Board”).

In February 1990, the State of Illinois  legalized riverboat  gambling.  The Illinois  Act authorizes the Illinois  Board to issue up to ten riverboat gaming owners’
licenses on any water within the State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Act restricts the
location of certain of the ten owners’ licenses.  Three of the licenses must be located on the Mississippi River.  One license must be at a location on the Illinois River south
of Marshall County and another license must be located on the Des Plaines River in Will County.  The remaining licenses are not restricted as to location.  Currently, all
ten owner’s licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St.  Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island, Des Plaines, and two licenses in Joliet.

The Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations.  It grants the Illinois Board specific powers and
duties, and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of
riverboat gaming.  The Illinois Board has authority over every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in the State
of Illinois.

The  Illinois  Act  requires  the  owner  of  a  riverboat  gaming  operation  to  hold  an  owner’s  license  issued  by the  Illinois  Board.   Each owner’s  license  permits  the
holder to own up to two riverboats as part of its gaming operation; however, gaming participants are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license.  The number of gaming
participants will be determined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time.  Gaming positions are counted as follows:

•

•

•

positions for electronic gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total number of devices available for play;

craps tables will be counted as having ten gaming positions; and

games utilizing live gaming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions.

Each owner’s license initially runs for a period of three years.  Thereafter, the license must be renewed annually.  The Board may renew an owner’s license for up
to four years.  An owner licensee is eligible for renewal upon payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Board that the licensee continues to meet all
of the requirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois Board’s rules.  The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and was renewed for a four-year
period that ends in October 2020.  An ownership interest in an owner’s license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior approval of the Illinois
Board.

11

Pursuant  to  the  Illinois  Act,  the  Illinois  Board  established  certain  rules  to  follow  in  deciding  whether  to  approve  direct  or  indirect  ownership  or  control  of  an
owner’s  license.    The  Illinois  Board  must  consider  the  impact  of  any  economic  concentration  caused  by  the  ownership  or  control.    No  direct  or  indirect  ownership  or
control may be approved which will result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a riverboat gambling operation in Illinois.  The Illinois Act specifies a
number  of  criteria  for  the  Illinois  Board  to  consider  in  determining  whether  the  approval  of  the  issuance,  transfer  or  holding  of  a  license  will  create  undue  economic
concentration.  The application of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for the Grand Victoria or our 50% joint venture interest therein.

The  Illinois  Act  does  not  limit  the  maximum  bet  or  per  patron  loss.    Minimum  and  maximum  wagers  on  games  are  set  by  the  holder  of  the  owner’s
license.  Wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency.  No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers only may be received
from a person present on the riverboat.  With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% or more than 100%.

Illinois imposes a number of taxes on Illinois casinos.  Such taxes are subject to change by the Illinois legislature and have been increased in the past.  The Illinois
legislature  also  may  impose  new  taxes  on  Grand  Victoria’s  activities.    Illinois  currently  imposes  an  admission  tax  of  $2.00  per  person  for  an  owner  licensee  that
admitted 1,000,000 persons or fewer in the 2004 calendar year, and $3.00 per person for all other owner licensees (including Grand Victoria).

Additionally, Illinois imposes a wagering tax on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation.  The owner licensee is required,

on a daily basis, to wire the wagering tax payment to the Illinois Board.  Currently, the wagering tax is:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

15.0% of adjusted gross receipts up to and including $25.0 million;

22.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $25.0 million but not exceeding $50.0 million;

27.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $50.0 million but not exceeding $75.0 million;

32.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $75.0 million but not exceeding $100.0 million;

37.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $100.0 million but not exceeding $150.0 million;

45.0% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $150.0 million but not exceeding $200.0 million; and

50.0% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $200.0 million.

A holder of any gaming license in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act by
the licensee or the licensee’s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois,
or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as the Illinois Board
may determine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owner’s license, without notice or hearing, upon a
determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat’s operation.  The suspension may remain in effect until the Illinois
Board  determines  that  the  cause  for  suspension  has  been  abated  and  it  may  revoke  the  owner’s  license  upon  a  determination  that  the  owner  has  not  made  satisfactory
progress toward abating the hazard.

If the Illinois Board has suspended, revoked or refused to renew an owner’s license or if a riverboat gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarily
surrendering its owner’s license, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver.  The circuit court has
sole jurisdiction over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver.  The Illinois Board specifies the specific powers, duties and limitations of the receiver.

The Illinois Board requires that each “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated and approved
by the Illinois Board.  The Illinois Board determines which positions, individuals or Business Entities are required to be approved by the Board as Key Persons.  Once
approved, such Key Person status must be maintained.  Key Persons include:

•

any Business Entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trust
holding such ownership interest or voting rights;

12

•

•

•

the directors of the licensee or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents;

a  Gaming  Operations  Manager  or  any  other  business  entity  or  individual  who  has  influence  and/or  control  over  the  conduct  of  gaming  or  the  Riverboat
Gaming Operation; and

all other individuals or Business Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Board determines
hold a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Board for the specified
licensee or applicant.

Each owner licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order of
the Illinois Board.  Based upon findings from an investigation into the character, reputation, experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of a Key
Person, the Illinois Board may enter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person.

Applicants for and holders of an owner’s license are required to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval for changes in the following:  (i) Key Persons; (ii) type of
entity; (iii) equity and debt capitalization of the entity; (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) source of funds; (vi) applicant’s economic development plan; (vii) riverboat
capacity or significant design change; (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to the acquisition or disposition
of property (real or personal) of a value greater than $1 million.  Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owner’s license may make distributions to its stockholders
only to the extent that such distributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner.

The Illinois Board requires each holder of an owner’s license to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval prior to issuing a guaranty of any indebtedness.  Accordingly,
we  and  our  subsidiaries  with  a  direct  interest  in  Grand  Victoria  intend  to  petition  the  Illinois  Board  to  allow  those  subsidiaries  to  issue  subsidiary guaranties of any
indebtedness  that  we  incur  in  the  future  to  the  extent  such  guaranties are required  by  our  lenders.    Although  we  and  those subsidiaries believe  the Illinois  Board will
continue  to  approve  our  petitions  and  allow  such  guaranties  of  our  future  indebtedness,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Illinois  Board  will  continue  to  grant  the
necessary approvals.

The  Illinois  Board  requires  that  each  “institutional  investor,”  as  that  term  is  defined  by  Illinois  Board,  that,  individually  or  jointly  with  others,  cumulatively
acquires, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall, within no
less  than  ten  days  after  acquiring  such  securities,  notify  the  Illinois  Board  of  such  ownership  and  shall,  upon  request,  provide  such  additional  information  as  may  be
required by the Illinois Board.  An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of any class of
voting  securities  of  a  publicly-traded  licensee  or  a  licensee’s  publicly-traded  parent  corporation  shall  file  an  “Institutional  Investor  Disclosure  Form,”  provided  by  the
Illinois Board, within 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by the Illinois Board.  Additionally, we
must notify the Illinois Board as soon as possible after we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor.

The Illinois Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public and the

gaming industry.  Also, the Illinois Board may, from time to time, amend or change its rules.

On  January  1,  2008,  Illinois’  statewide  public  smoking  ban  became  effective.    Smoking  is  now  illegal  in  Illinois’  casinos,  bars,  restaurants  and  other  public

establishments.  This may continue to negatively impact the gaming industry in Illinois.

From  time  to  time,  various  proposals  have  been  introduced  in  the  Illinois  legislature  that,  if  enacted,  would  affect  the  taxation,  regulation,  operation  or  other
aspects  of  the  gaming  industry.    The  Illinois  legislature  regularly  considers  proposals  that  would  expand  gaming  opportunities  in  Illinois.    Some  of  this  legislation,  if
enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry.  No assurance can be given whether such or similar legislation will be enacted.

The Illinois legislature continues to discuss the possibility of gaming expansion.  This expansion could include several new casinos (including one in Chicago),
increased gaming positions in existing casinos, as well as gaming positions at Illinois racetracks.  If gaming expansion occurs, Grand Victoria’s operating results could be
adversely impacted by the increased competition.

13

On  July  13,  2009,  Illinois  enacted  the  Video  Gaming  Act,  which  legalizes  the  use  of  up  to  five  video  gaming  terminals  in  most  bars,  restaurants,  fraternal
organizations and veterans’ organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops.  The Illinois Board adopted a set of Regulations and
continues to release new or emergency Regulations, as necessary, to implement and regulate the Video Gaming Act.  Effective October 9, 2012, video gaming in Illinois
became operational.  The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack.   In December 201 6 ,
over 5,700 licensed establishments were operating nearly 2 5 ,000 video gaming terminals.  Grand Victoria’s revenues may be adversely impacted by the availability of
video gaming terminals in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base.

Macau
S.A.R.

Laws
and
Regulations

MGM Grand Paradise is regulated as a gaming operator under applicable Macau law and our ownership interest in MGM Grand Paradise is subject to continuing
regulatory scrutiny.  We are required to be approved by the Macau government (gaming authorities) to own an interest in a gaming operator.  Authorized gaming operators
must pay  periodic  fees  and  taxes,  and gaming  rights  are  not  transferable,  unless  approved  by the  Macau  government.   MGM Grand Paradise  must  periodically  submit
detailed financial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authorities may require.  No person may
acquire any rights over the shares or assets of MGM Grand Paradise without first obtaining the approval of the Macau gaming authorities.  The transfer or creation of
encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating to such shares, and any act involving the granting of
voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons or entities other than the original owners, would require the approval of the Macau government and the subsequent
report of such acts and transactions to the Macau gaming authorities.  The stock of MGM Grand Paradise and its casinos, assets and equipment shall not be subject to any
liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any of the
direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to
or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise.  Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply to securities that are listed
and tradable on a stock market.  Since MGM Grand Paradise’s securities are not listed and tradable on a stock market this approval requirement applies to transfers of
MGM Grand Paradise’s shares.  In addition, this contract requires that the Macau government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or the grant of voting
rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us,
provided that such shares or rights are indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise.  This notice
requirement will not apply, however, to securities listed and tradable on a stock exchange.

MGM Grand Paradise is in no case allowed to delegate the management of gaming operations to a management company, and is in no case allowed to enter into a
management contract by which its managing powers are or might be assumed by a third party.  Any act or contract by which MGM Grand Paradise assigns, transfers,
alienates or creates liens or encumbrances on gaming operations to or in favor of a third party is prohibited, unless previously approved by the Macau government.

The Macau gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, MGM Grand Paradise to determine
whether  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  suitability  and/or  financial  capacity  is  affected  by  that  individual.    MGM  Grand  Paradise  shareholders  with  5%  or  more  of  the  share
capital and directors must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, and accept the persistent
and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macau government.  MGM Grand Paradise is required to immediately notify the Macau government should
MGM Grand Paradise become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% or more of the share capital, or any
director or key employee.  Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities.  The Macau gaming authorities have jurisdiction to
deny an application for a finding of suitability.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macau gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.  Any
stockholder subject to a suitability process who is found unsuitable must transfer their shares to a third party within a term set by the Macau government.  If such transfer
is not consummated, MGM Grand Paradise must acquire those shares.  If any officer, director or key employee is found unsuitable, MGM Grand Paradise must sever all
relationships with that person.  In case of failure to act in accordance thereof, MGM Grand Paradise would become subject to administrative sanctions and penalties.

The Macau government must give their prior approval to changes in control of MGM Grand Paradise through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition,
management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control.  Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered corporation
must satisfy the Macau government concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control.  The Macau gaming authorities may also require controlling
stockholders,

14

officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be considered suitable as part of the
approval process of the transaction.

The Macau gaming authorities also have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their

affiliates.

The  subconcession  contract  requires  the  Macau  gaming  authorities’  prior  approval  of  any  recapitalization  plan,  any  increase  of  the  capital  stock  by  public
subscription, any issue of preferential shares or any creation, issue or transformation of types or series of shares representative of MGM Grand Paradise capital stock, as
well as any change in the constituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise.  The Chief Executive of Macau could also require MGM Grand
Paradise to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary.

MGM  Macau  was  constructed  and  is  operated  under  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  contract.    This  subconcession  excludes  the  following  gaming
activities:    mutual  bets,  gaming  activities  provided  to  the  public,  interactive  gaming  and  games  of  chance  or  other  gaming,  betting  or  gambling  activities  on  ships  or
planes.    MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  subconcession  is  exclusively  governed  by  Macau  law.    MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  subject  to  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  of
Macau in case of any potential dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations and related
equipment in MGM Macau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM Resorts International
will cease to generate any revenues from these operations.  Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession by giving MGM Grand
Paradise at least one year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity.

The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption.

The  Macau  government  also  has  the  right  to  unilaterally  terminate,  without  compensation  to  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  the  subconcession  at  any  time  upon  the
occurrence of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession
contract.  If the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though no specific cure period
for that purpose is provided.

The  subconcession  contract  contains  various  general  covenants  and  obligations  and  other  provisions,  the  compliance  with  which  is  subjective.    MGM  Grand

Paradise has the following obligations under the subconcession contract:

•

•

•

•

ensure the proper operation and conduct of casino games;

employ people with appropriate qualifications;

operate and conduct casino games of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and

safeguard and ensure Macau’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas.

The subconcession contract requires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place.

MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also subject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities.

Under the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R.  an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion
based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated.  The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas (approximately
$3.75 million, based on exchange rates at December 30, 2016).  The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively for certain kinds of
games  or  players,  150,000  patacas  per  gaming  table  not  so  reserved  and  1,000  patacas  per  electrical  or  mechanical  gaming  machine,  including  slot  machines
(approximately  $37,578,  $$18,789  and  $125,  respectively,  based  on  exchange  rates  at  December  30,  2016),  subject  to  a  minimum  of  forty  five  million  patacas
(approximately $5.6 million, based on exchange rates at December 30, 2016).  MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming
revenues  and  applicable  withholding  taxes.    It  must  also  contribute  1.6%  and  2.4%  (a  portion  of  which  must  be  used  for  promotion  of  tourism  in  Macau)  of  its  gross
gaming revenue to a public foundation designated by the Macau S.A.R. government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as special levy.

15

Currently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue.  However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for credit
losses.  As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has to pay taxes on
its winnings from these customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables.

MGM  Grand  Paradise  has  received  a  concession  from  the  Macau  government  to  use  a  10.67  acre  parcel  of  land  for  MGM  Macau  (the  “MGM  Macau  Land

Contract”).  The land concession will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable.

The MGM Macau Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau.  In addition, MGM
Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract.  The rent amount may be revised every five years by the Macau
government, according to the provisions of the Macau Land law.

In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  has  received  a  concession  from  the  Macau  government  to  use  an  approximately  18  acre  site  in  Cotai  Macau  and  develop  a
second resort and casino (the “Cotai Land Contract”).  The land concession contract became effective on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  The total
land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semi-annual
payments.  As of December 31, 2016, MGM China had paid $159 million of the contract premium, including interest due on the semi-annual installments.  In January
2017, MGM China paid the final semi-annual payment of $15 million under the land concession contract.  Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand
Paradise is required to complete the development of the land by January 2018.

MGM Grand Paradise received an exemption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for a period of
five-years starting at January 1, 2007.  In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.  The exemption
runs through December 31, 2016.

Maryland
Government
Regulation

The Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensive state
licensing and regulatory requirements.  We are subject to the Maryland VLT Law and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in MGM
National Harbor, LLC, which owns and operates the MGM National Harbor video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

Under the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lottery and
Gaming Control Agency (“Maryland Agency”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within the State of Maryland, and
to issue video lottery operation licenses to qualified applicants.  The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“Maryland Location Commission”) has the
authority to award up to six video lottery operation licenses within the State of Maryland and is responsible for evaluating competing proposals and awarding the video
lottery  operation  licenses  to  applicants  based  on  business  and  market,  economic  development  and  location  siting  factors.   The  Maryland  Location  Commission  cannot
award a video lottery  operation license  to an applicant  until the Maryland Commission determines  that the applicant  is qualified.   On October 10, 2013, the Maryland
Commission determined that MGM National Harbor, LLC and all applicable principals were qualified, and on December 23, 2013, the Maryland Location Commission
awarded the video lottery operation license in Prince George’s County, Maryland to MGM National Harbor, LLC.  MGM National Harbor, LLC was awarded the sixth
and final video lottery operation license in Maryland.  On December 7, 2016, the Maryland Commission issued a video lottery operation license to MGM National Harbor,
LLC, which license has an initial term of 15 years.

The initial license fee was based on the number of video lottery terminals initially proposed within the video lottery facility.  As 3,600 video lottery terminals were
proposed for MGM National Harbor, our initial license fee was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that MGM National Harbor may have up
to 3,600 terminals.  Within 1 year of the end of the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has a license term of 10
years and a license fee to be established by statute.

At the request of the Company, the Maryland Commission has temporarily  reduced the number of permitted video lottery terminals  to 3,321, which temporary

reduction will become permanent if there are not 3,600 terminals in operation at MGM National Harbor by December 8, 2017.

Under  the  Maryland  VLT Law,  video  lottery  terminals  each  must  have  an  average  payout  percentage  of  at  least  87%.   Video  lottery  facilities  are  permitted  to

operate 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  While alcohol may be offered

16

in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free of charge.  The Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit and
credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within the video lottery facility.

The Maryland Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operation license,
affiliated holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or
greater interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law.

The Maryland VLT Law provides that institutional investors may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements, and an Institutional Investor Waiver Application
may be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors.  The term “institutional investor” generally includes
insurance companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc.  The Maryland Commission’s decision concerning
whether to grant a waiver is discretionary, and based on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the institutional investor’s securities, whether the investor is
substantially involved in the video lottery operations of the licensee, and the investor’s gaming licensure history in other jurisdictions.

After a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the
licensee and its officers, directors, and other designated persons.  The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lottery operation
license, and may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations is expressly deemed a
revocable privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditioned on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meeting reporting requirements
and  continuing  to  provide  any  assistance  and  information  necessary  to  the  Maryland  regulators.    Each  licensee  has  an  affirmative  responsibility  to  provide  an  annual
update  of  applicable  licensing  information  to  the  Maryland  Commission.    Among  other  things,  the  Maryland  Commission  is  also  responsible  for  the  collection  of
application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and
may conduct unannounced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.

The regulations promulgated to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to video lottery licensing and
ongoing  operations.    The  regulations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  provisions  concerning:    licensing  investigations  and  hearings;  marketing  controls  and  standards;
internal  control  standards  related  to  accounting,  finance  and  statistics,  audits,  record  retention,  complimentaries,  surveillance,  security,  cage  and  customer  transactions,
promotions,  and  other  gaming  related  controls;  facility  design  standards;  table  games  surveillance;  gaming  floor  plans;  the  transportation  and  testing  of  video  lottery
terminals  and  table  games  equipment;  the  registration  of  video  lottery  terminals  and  table  games;  voluntary  and  mandatory  patron  exclusion;  responsible  gaming;  and
junket enterprises  and representatives.   Applicants  and licensees  must also meet  requirements  concerning  minority  business participation,  provide health  insurance  and
retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility.

Generally,

 a  video  lottery  operation  license  may  not

 from  the  Maryland
Commission.  Specifically, a licensee cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interests in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission is notified
and determines that the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and regulatory requirements.  If the licensee fails to meet these requirements, the applicable
license will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.  Entities and individuals are also prohibited from owning an interest in more than one video
lottery facility, and any application to the Maryland Location Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting the applicable interest in the
initial  license.    Applicants  seeking  investors  in  an  entity  applying  for  a  video  lottery  operation  license  must  make  serious,  good-faith  efforts  to  solicit  and  interview  a
reasonable  number  of  minority  investors  before  a  license  will  be  awarded  by  the  Maryland  Location  Commission,  and  following  the  award,  must  again  make  serious,
good-faith efforts to interview minority investors in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity awarded the license.

The Maryland Commission retains the authority to recommend or propose changes to the Maryland VLT Law, and may amend or change regulations concerning

the Maryland VLT Law, which, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.

New
Jersey
Government
Regulation

Our  ownership  of  Borgata  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey  subjects  us  to  extensive  state  regulation  under  the  New  Jersey  Casino  Control  Act  and  the  regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations.  The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJ Commission”) and the
New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” and, together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, to varying degrees, empowered to
regulate a wide spectrum

17

of  gaming  and  non-gaming  related  activities  and  to  approve  the  form  of  ownership  and  financial  structure  of  not  only  a  casino  licensee,  but  also  its  holding  and
intermediary companies and entity qualifiers.

The NJ Commission issues casino licenses and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits to conduct
intrastate Internet gaming and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.  The NJ Division also is responsible for investigating all
license applications and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act.

On June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s casino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation of law.  However,
no later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying entities and individuals
must submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification.  In addition, the NJ Commission may reopen the license hearing at
any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division.  In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries were found qualified as holding
companies of Borgata.

Pursuant  to  the  NJ  Act  and  applicable  precedent,  no  entity  may  hold  a  casino  license  unless  each  officer,  director,  person  who  directly  or  indirectly  holds  any
beneficial interest or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect a
majority  of  the  board  of  directors  of  the  licensee  (other  than  a  banking  or  other  licensed  lending  institution  acting  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business)  and  each  of  its
holding, intermediary or subsidiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities.

Persons holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or elect one or
more of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required to individually
qualify.    Equity  securities  are  defined  in  the  NJ  Act  as  any  voting  stock  or  any  other  security  having  a  direct  or  indirect  participation  in  the  profits  of  the
issuer.  Notwithstanding either the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casino licensee
establish  and  maintain  the  qualification  of  certain  holders  of  debt  securities,  the  NJ  Act  provides  for  a  waiver  of  qualification  for  passive  “institutional  investors,”  as
defined by the NJ Act under certain circumstances.

Casino licensees are also required to establish and maintain the qualifications of any financial backer, investor, mortgagee, bondholder, or holder of indentures,
notes or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds 25% or more of
such  financial  instruments  or  other  evidences  of  indebtedness;  provided,  however,  in  circumstances  of  default,  persons  holding  10%  of  such  financial  instruments  or
evidences of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications.  Persons who hold less than these thresholds may be required to establish and
maintain  their  qualifications  in the  discretion  of the  Director  of the  NJ Division.  Banks and licensed  lending  institutions,  however,  are  exempt  from  any qualification
requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business.

The NJ Act imposes certain restrictions upon the issuance, ownership and transfer of securities of a casino licensee and its holding and intermediary companies and
defines the term “security” to include instruments which evidence a direct or indirect beneficial ownership or creditor interest, including stock (common and preferred)
mortgages, debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights.  If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securities is not qualified under the NJ
Act, it has the right to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of such securities.  In the event that
certain disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power to revoke or suspend the casino license or licenses related to the
company  which  issued  the  securities.    It  is  unlawful  for  a  disqualified  holder  (i)  to  exercise,  directly  or  through  any  trustee  or  nominee,  any  right  conferred  by  such
securities  or  (ii)  to receive  any  dividends  or  interest  upon such  securities  or  any  remuneration,  in  any form,  from  its  affiliated  casino  licensee  for  services  rendered  or
otherwise.

The NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified by the
NJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in the company.  Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that a holder of our
securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the NJ Act.  In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we may redeem the
stock of any holder found to be disqualified.

The ability of a lender to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with the NJ Act.  Generally, no person is permitted to
hold an ownership interest in or manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed.  Consequently, any lender who desires to
enforce a security interest must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain interim casino
authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest.  Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or of

18

gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA prior to obtaining any
ownership interest or gaming assets.

Massachusetts
Government
Regulation

The  Massachusetts  Expanded  Gaming  Act  (“Massachusetts  Act”)  subjects  the  owners  and  operators  of  gaming  establishments  to  extensive  state  licensing  and
regulatory  requirements.    We  are  subject  to  the  Massachusetts  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  it  through  our  ownership  interest  in  Blue  Tarp
reDevelopment, LLC (“Blue Tarp”), which is expected to operate a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts, which establishment is currently scheduled for
completion and opening in the third quarter of 2018.

Under the Massachusetts Act, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (“Massachusetts Commission”) is responsible for issuing licenses under the Massachusetts
Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons.  The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (“IEB”), which is a
Bureau  within  the  Massachusetts  Commission,  is  responsible  for  conducting  administrative  investigations  of  applicants  and  licensees,  and  for  generally  enforcing  the
Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts State Police, Attorney General
and  the  Alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Commission  in  order  to  perform  its  duties.    The  Massachusetts  Act  also  establishes  a  Gaming  Enforcement  Division  within  the
Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the Massachusetts Act.  The Massachusetts Commission has
the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slot machines only), within the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to qualified applicants.

On  December  23,  2013,  the  Massachusetts  Commission  determined  that  Blue  Tarp  and  all  applicable  principal  individuals  and  entities  were  qualified,  and  on

November 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Commission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014.

While a Category 1 license has been awarded to Blue Tarp, Blue Tarp may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued by the
Massachusetts Commission, which will be issued upon compliance with applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, receipt of
all required permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Blue Tarp’s Category 1 license, and Blue Tarp continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration,
qualification and other regulatory requirements.  Under the Massachusetts Act, a Category 1 gaming licensee who fails to commence operations within one year from the
opening  date  approved  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  is  subject  to  the  suspension  or  revocation  of  its  license  and,  if  the  Commission  determines  that  the  gaming
licensee acted in bad faith in its application, be assessed a fine of $50,000,000 or less.

The initial license term is 15 years, which will commence upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gaming
establishment.  The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized by the Massachusetts Act,
which amount Blue Tarp has paid.  All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licensees are also subject to additional annual fees under the Massachusetts Act.  Category 1
licensees must generally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amount equal to 3.5 percent of the net gaming
revenues derived from the establishment.

Under the Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  Gaming beverage licenses may be
granted  by  the  Massachusetts  Commission  for  the  sale  and  distribution  of  alcoholic  beverages  at  the  gaming  establishment  except  between  the  hours  of  2  a.m.    and  8
a.m..  The Massachusetts Act and regulations also describe procedures for, and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions
within  the  gaming  establishment.    Certain  regulations  related  to  these  transactions  and  other  casino  internal  controls  are  currently  in  draft  form,  and  subject  to  further
review, revision and final approval.

The  Massachusetts  Commission,  in  particular  the  IEB,  has  extensive  authority  to  conduct  background  investigations  and  to  determine  whether  applicants  for
Category 1 and Category 2 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates, key
gaming  executives  and  employees,  other  gaming  related  employees,  and  other  persons  or  entities  holding  a  five  percent  or  greater  direct  or  indirect  interest  in  the
applicant, are qualified under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission).

After a Category 1 license is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee and
its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons.  The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category 1 license,
or  any  other  license  issued  under  the  Massachusetts  Act,  and  the  IEB  may  levy  civil  penalties  for  regulatory  and  other  violations.    All  licenses  issued  under  the
Massachusetts Act are expressly

19

deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee’s
continuing qualification and suitability .   Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees,
conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment
premises or the licensee’s records and equipment .

The  regulations  promulgated  to  implement  the  Massachusetts  Act  impose  detailed  substantive  and  procedural  requirements  related  to  licensing  and  on-going
operations.  The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees; accounting procedures and internal controls;
surveillance  and  security  requirements;  gaming  equipment,  devices  and  systems,  and  device  registration  and  testing;  self-exclusion;  on-going  reporting  requirements
related to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements related to new or changes in
shareholders,  executives,  and  other  qualifiers;  notification  and/or  approval  of  certain  material  events  and  transactions;  complimentary  services;  on-going  capital
expenditures;  political  contributions;  credit  issuance  and  customer  transactions;  auditing  and  record  retention;  facility  design  and  gaming  floor  plans;  slot  machine
possession and transportation; table game rules and procedures; employee credentials; vendors and junkets; and count room and cage procedures.

Generally,  interests  in  a  gaming  establishment  and  Category  1  licenses  may  not  be  transferred  without  notification  to  and  approval  of  the  Massachusetts
Commission.  The sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and will be
ineffective if disapproved by the Massachusetts Commission.  Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without the notification and
approval of the Massachusetts Commission, and may not operate, invest in or own, in whole or in part, another gaming licensee’s license or gaming establishment.

The  Massachusetts  Commission  retains  the  authority  to  promulgate,  amend  or  repeal  regulations  concerning  the  Massachusetts  Act,  which,  if  enacted,  could
adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Massachusetts.  Further, certain regulations are currently in draft form, and subject to further review,
revision and final approval.

NDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’
REPORT

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  CityCenter  Holdings,  LLC  and  its  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”),  which  comprise  the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’
Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s  internal  control.  Accordingly,  we  express  no  such  opinion.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings, LLC
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2016, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES
TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Organization.
CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the “Company”) is a Delaware limited liability company formed on November 2, 2007. The Company was formed to
acquire, own, develop and operate the CityCenter development (“CityCenter”) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company is a joint venture which is 50%-owned by wholly
owned  subsidiaries  of  MGM  Resorts  International  (together  with  its  subsidiaries,  “MGM  Resorts”),  a  Delaware  corporation,  and  50%-owned  by  Infinity  World
Development  Corp  (“Infinity  World”),  which  is  wholly  owned  by  Dubai  World,  a  Dubai  United  Arab  Emirates  government  decree  entity  (each,  a  “Member”).  The
governing document for the Company is the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement dated December 22, 2015 (the “LLC Agreement”).

Under the LLC Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of six representatives (subject to intermittent vacancies) – three selected by each
Member – and has exclusive power and authority for the overall management of the Company. Compensation for Board of Directors’ duties is borne by the Members. The
Company has no employees and has entered into several agreements with MGM Resorts to provide for the development and day-to-day management of CityCenter and the
Company. See Note 14 for further discussion of such agreements.

Nature
of
Business.
CityCenter is a mixed-use development on the Las Vegas Strip located between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo resorts, both owned by MGM

Resorts. CityCenter consists of the following components:

•

•

•

•

Aria Resort & Casino, a 4,004-room casino resort featuring an approximately 140,000 square-foot casino, approximately 300,000 square feet of conference
and convention space, and numerous world-class restaurants, nightclub and bars, and pool and spa amenities;

The Vdara Hotel and Spa, a luxury condominium-style hotel with 1,495 units;

Mandarin Oriental, Las Vegas, a 392-room non-gaming boutique hotel managed by luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, as well as 225 luxury
residential units (all 225 units were sold and closed as of December 31, 2015); and

The Veer Towers, 669 units in two towers consisting entirely of luxury residential condominium units (all 669 units were sold and closed as of December 31,
2016).

In April 2016, the Company closed the sale of The Shops at Crystals (“Crystals”). See Note 3 for additional information related to the sale.

Substantially  all  of  the  operations  of  CityCenter  commenced  in  December  2009.  See  Note  11  for  discussion  of  the  demolition  of  the  Harmon  Hotel  &  Spa

(“Harmon”).

NOTE
2
—
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis
of
presentation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company does not have a variable
interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected in the future.

Reclassification.
Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses have been reclassified related to discontinued operations. See Note 3 for additional information

related to discontinued operations.

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
 The consolidated  financial  statements  have been prepared  in conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the
United  States  of  America.  Those  principles  require  the  Company’s  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
 Fair  value  measurements  affect  the  Company’s  accounting  for  and  impairment  assessments  of  its  long-lived  assets  and  intangible
assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable
inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

5

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of

acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
 The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  of
December  31,  2016,  approximately  64%  of  the  Company’s  casino  receivables  were  due  from  customers  from  foreign  countries.  Enforceability  issues,  business  or
economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Trade  receivables,  including  casino  and  hotel  receivables,  are  typically  non-interest  bearing  and  are  initially  recorded  at  cost.  Accounts  are  written  off  when
management  deems  the  account  to  be  uncollectible.  Recoveries  of  accounts  previously  written  off  are  recorded  when  received.  An  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is
maintained  to  reduce  the  Company’s  receivables  to  their  estimated  realizable  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.  The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  a  specific
review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2016,
no significant concentrations of credit risk existed.

Inventories.
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is

determined primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.

Residential
real
estate.
As of December 31, 2016, all residential units were sold. In prior periods, residential real estate represented capitalized costs of residential
inventory,  which  consisted  of  completed  condominium  units  available  for  sale  less  impairments  previously  recognized.  Costs  included  land,  direct  and  indirect
construction and development costs, and capitalized property taxes and interest.

Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are
included  in  the  determination  of  income  or  loss.  Maintenance  and  repairs  that  neither  materially  add  to  the  value  of  the  property  nor  appreciably  prolong  its  life  are
charged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

20 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 15 years

Project costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts to the
extent such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value.
Final  costs  of  CityCenter  development  were  determined  in  connection  with  settlement  of  Perini  litigation  in  December  2014  as  discussed  in  Note  11.  The  Company
recorded non-operating expense related to the Perini settlement of $8 million for statutory interest on estimated amounts payable in 2014.

In  December  2015,  the  Company  decided  to  close  the  Zarkana  show  at  the  Aria  Resort  &  Casino  as  part  of  a  plan  to  expand  its  conference  and  convention
space. As a result, the Company shortened the useful lives of the assets related to the Zarkana theatre and recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $82 million and
$20 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fully depreciated assets related to the Zarkana theatre were disposed in April 2016 and
construction of the conference and expansion space began in May 2016.

Capitalized
interest.
    The  interest  costs  associated  with  development  and  construction  projects  are  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  the  project.

Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Impairment
of
long-lived
assets.
The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to be held
and used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
amount  of  the  asset.  If  the  undiscounted  cash  flows  exceed  the  carrying  value,  no  impairment  is  indicated.  If  the  undiscounted  cash  flows  do  not  exceed  the  carrying
amount, then impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model.

Intangible
assets.
 Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain  circumstances.  The

Company performs its annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. See Note 6 for further discussion.

6

Debt
issuance
costs
. The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalized costs

are amortized straight-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt.

Revenue
recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized
for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“casino outstanding chip liability”). Hotel,
food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided. Advance deposits on rooms and
advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer.

Gaming  revenues  are  recognized  net  of  certain  sales  incentives,  including  discounts  and  points  earned  in  point-loyalty  programs.  The  retail  value  of
accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The
estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Real
estate
sales.
 Revenue  for  residential  sales  is  deferred  until  closing  occurs,  which  is  when  title,  possession  and  other  attributes  of  ownership  have  been
transferred to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment must be adequate
to demonstrate a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination.

Residential operating expenses include cost of real estate sold, holding costs, selling costs, indirect selling costs and valuation allowances for residential mortgage
notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrative expense, which
were expensed as incurred.

Loyalty
programs.
Aria participates in the MGM Resorts’ “M life Rewards” loyalty program. Customers may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming
play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M life Rewards front desk at participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on
participating  machines.  The Company records  a liability  based on the points  earned  multiplied  by the redemption  value,  less an estimate  for points not expected  to be
redeemed,  and  records  a  corresponding  reduction  in  casino  revenue.  Customers  also  earn  Express  Comps  based  on  their  gaming  play  which  can  be  redeemed  for
complimentary goods and services, including hotel rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment.  The Company records a liability for the estimated costs of providing
goods and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expected to be redeemed
and records a corresponding expense in the casino department.

Advertising.
 The  Company  expenses  advertising  costs  the  first  time  the  advertising  takes  place.  Advertising  expense  is  included  in  preopening  and  start-up
expenses when related to the preopening and start-up period and in general and administrative expense when related to ongoing operations. Advertising expense was $15
million, $20 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and gains

and losses on the sale of fixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 for details.

Income
taxes.
The Company is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, federal income taxes are the responsibility of the Members. As

a result, no provision for income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented.

Dividends
and
distributions.
 In  March  2016, a  $90  million  dividend  was declared  in  accordance  with  the  Company’s  annual  distribution  policy,  and  in  April

2016, the Company declared a $990 million special distribution in connection with the Crystals sale.

7

Of these dividends and distributions totaling $1.1 billion, $540 million was paid to MGM Resorts in May 2016 and $540 million was paid to Infinity World in July 2016.
In April 2015, the Company declared and paid a special dividend of $400 million. Under the annual distribution policy, the Company intends to distribute up to 35% of
excess cash flow, subject to the approval of the Company’s board of directors.

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
 In  2015  and  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  the  following  Accounting  Standard
Updates (“ASU”) related to revenue recognition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and December 15, 2018, for public entities and nonpublic
entities, respectively, pursuant to ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”:

•

•

•

•

ASU 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU
2014-09  provides  for  a  new  revenue  recognition  model  which  includes  a  five-step  analysis  in  determining  when  and  how  revenue  is  recognized,
including  identification  of  separate  performance  obligations  for  each  contract  with  a  customer.  Additionally,  the  new  model  will  require  revenue
recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive
in exchange for those goods or services;

ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),”
clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-08 provides guidance related to
the assessment an entity is required to perform to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is,
the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent) when another party is
involved in providing goods or services to a customer;

ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” clarifies guidance related to
identifying  performance  obligations  and  licensing  implementation  guidance  as  it  relates  to  ASU  2014-09.  ASU  2016-10  includes  targeted
improvements  based  on  input  the  FASB  received  from  the  Transition  Resource  Group  for  Revenue  Recognition  and  other  stakeholders.  It  seeks  to
proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects
of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis; and

ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” addresses narrow-scope
improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition as it relates to ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-12
also provides for a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes
and other similar taxes collected from customers.

The  Company  is  currently  assessing  the  impact  that  the  adoption  of  the  above  ASUs  related  to  revenue  recognition  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financial
statements  and footnote disclosures.  The Company plans to adopt the above ASUs for the fiscal  year beginning after  December  15, 2017. However, the Company has
identified a few significant impacts. Under the new guidance the Company expects it will no longer be permitted to recognize revenues for goods and services provided to
customers for free as an inducement to gamble as gross revenue with a corresponding offset to promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues as discussed above. The
Company  expects  the  majority  of  such  amounts  will  offset  casino  revenues.  In  addition,  accounting  for  Express  Comps  granted  under  MGM  Resort’s  M  life  Rewards
program as outlined above will also change. Under the new guidance Express Comps earned by customers through past revenue transactions will be identified as separate
performance  obligations  and will be recorded as a reduction in gaming revenues when earned at the retail  value of such benefits owed to the customer  (less estimated
breakage). When customers redeem such benefits and the performance obligation is fulfilled by the Company, revenue will be recognized in the department that provides
the goods or services (i.e. hotel, food and beverage, entertainment).   In addition, given that M life Rewards is an aspirational program with multiple customer tiers which
provide  certain  benefits  to  tier  members,  the  Company  will  need  to  further  assess  if  such  benefits  are  deemed  to  be  separate  performance  obligations  under  the  new
guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance in
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840, “Leases.” ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December
15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance
leases  and  operating  leases  will  result  in  the  lessee  recognizing  a  right-of-use  (“ROU”)  asset  and  a  corresponding  lease  liability.  For  finance  leases  the  lessee  would
recognize  interest  expense  and  amortization  of  the  ROU  asset  and  for  operating  leases  the  lessee  would  recognize  a  straight-line  total  lease  expense.  The  Company  is
currently assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

8

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),” (“ASU 2016-15”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 amends
the guidance of ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the
diversity  in  practice  that  has  resulted  from  the  lack  of  consistent  principles,  specifically  clarifying  the  guidance  on  eight  cash  flow  issues.  The  Company  is  currently
assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent
events.
Management  has  evaluated  subsequent  events  through  February  17,  2017,  the  date  these  consolidated  financial  statements  were  issued.  In
January 2017, the Company repriced its $1.2 billion term loan B senior credit facility and re-priced and extended its $75 million revolving credit facility. See Note 8 for
details.

NOTE
3
—
ASSETS
HELD
FOR
SALE
AND
DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS;

In April 2016, the Company closed the sale of Crystals, a retail, dining and entertainment  district, to a venture led by Invesco Real Estate and Simon Property
Group  for  approximately  $1.1  billion.  The  Company  recognized  a  gain  of  $400  million  on  the  sale  of  Crystals,  which  is  included  within  “Income  from  discontinued
operations,”  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2016.  The  results  of  Crystals  are  classified  as  discontinued  operations  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of

The  majority  of  the  Company’s  intangible  assets  are  assets  that  were  contributed  by  MGM  Resorts  upon  formation  of  the  Company.  Intellectual  property
represents trademarks, domain names, and other intellectual property including the CityCenter,
Aria
and
Vdara
tradenames and Aria.com
domain. There is no contractual
or market-based limit to the use of these intangible assets and therefore they have been classified as indefinite-lived.

The Company performs an annual review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter each year. The asset’s fair value is compared
to its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recorded for any short-fall. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method which discounts cash flows that
would be required to obtain the use of the related intangible asset. Key inputs in the relief-from-royalty analysis include forecasted revenues related to the intangible asset,
market royalty rates, discount rates and terminal year growth rates.

The  aircraft  time  sharing  agreement  intangible  asset  relates  to  an  agreement  between  MGM  Resorts  and  the  Company  whereby  MGM  Resorts  provides  the

Company the use of MGM Resorts’ aircraft in its operations. The Company is charged a rate that is based

10

on  Federal  Aviation  Administration  regulations,  which  provides  for  reimbursement  for  specific  costs  incurred  by  MGM  Resorts  without  any  profit  or  mark-up.
Accordingly,  the  fair  value  of  this  agreement  was  recognized  as  an  intangible  asset,  and  is  being  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  20  years,  and  will  be  fully
amortized in 2029.

Senior
secured
credit
facility.
 At  December  31,  2016,  the  Company’s  senior  secured  credit  facility  consisted  of  a  $75  million  revolving  facility  maturing  in
October 2018, and a $1.2 billion term loan B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility requires the Company to make amortization payments of 0.25%
of the original principal balance at each quarter end. The Company used cash on hand to permanently repay $266 million of the term loan B facility during 2016. In June
2014 the Company completed a repricing of the term loan B facility and used available cash to permanently repay $150 million of the term loan B facility, a portion of
which represents the amortization obligation through the remaining term of the facility.

The loans under the term loan B bear interest, in the case of Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and in the case of base rate
loans, at the base rate plus 2.25%. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.25%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest, in the case of
Eurodollar  loans,  at  LIBOR  plus  3.75%  or  4.00%,  depending  on  the  Company’s  credit  ratings,  and  in  the  case  of  base  rate  loans,  2.75%  or  3.00%,  depending  on  the
Company’s ratings. Additionally, the Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, for the unused

11

portion of the revolving facility. The Company had $63 million of available borrowing capacity under its senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2016.

The senior secured credit facility is a general senior obligation of the Company and ranks equally with the Company’s other existing and future senior obligations,
is  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  on  a  senior  secured  basis  by  the  restricted  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  and  is  secured  by  a  first-priority  perfected  lien  on
substantially all of the Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries.

The senior secured credit facility contains customary positive, negative and financial covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintains a quarterly
minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0 and a maximum quarterly leverage ratio for the trailing four quarters of: 6.00:1.00 for March 31, 2016 through December 31,
2016; and 5.50:1.00 for March 31, 2017 and thereafter.  The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2016.

Pursuant to the senior secured credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayments of principal based on an annual calculation of excess cash
flow, as defined in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal year, with
50% required to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0 and greater than
4.0:1.0, and no payment of excess cash flow is required if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0. During 2016 and as of December 31, 2016, the Company did
not have excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior secured credit agreement for 2016. During 2015 the Company paid $38 million related to its
2015 excess cash flow obligation and recorded $5 million in current portion of long-term debt related to its remaining obligation.

In January 2017, the Company re-priced its $1.2 billion term loan B senior credit facility at par and re-priced and extended its $75 million revolving facility. The
term loan B facility will now bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  The revolving facility was re-priced at LIBOR plus 2.00% and extended
to July 2020.

Fair
value
of
long-term
debt.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.26 billion and

$1.50 billion, respectively, and was determined using estimates based on trading prices of similar liabilities, a Level 2 input.

Maturities

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The  Company  determines  its  segments  based  on  the  nature  of  the  products  and  services  provided.  As  of  December  31,  2016,  the  Company  has  the  following
reportable  segments:  Aria,  Vdara,  Mandarin  Oriental,  and  Residential.  The  Company  has  aggregated  residential  operations  from  Mandarin  Oriental  and  Veer  into  one
reportable segment “Residential” given the similar economic characteristics and business of selling and leasing high-rise condominiums. All other operating segments are
reported  separately.  The  Company’s  operating  segments  do  not  include  the  ongoing  activity  associated  with  closing  out  its  construction  costs  and  certain  corporate
administrative costs. During 2016 the Company sold Crystals which was previously a reportable segment.

The Company analyzes the results of its operating segments’ operations based on Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest and other non-
operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  NV  Energy  exit  expense,  and  property  transactions,  net.  The
Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is 1) a widely used measure of operating performance in the hospitality and gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of
hospitality and gaming companies.

While items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluating the Company’s or its segments’ earnings
performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending
on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, the Company believes excluded items may not relate
specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, write-downs and impairments includes normal recurring disposals and gains and
losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within CityCenter, but also includes impairment charges which may not be comparable period over period.

COMMITMENTS
AND
CONTINGENCIES

NV
Energy.
In July 2016, MGM Resorts, including the Company filed its notice to exit the fully bundled sales system of NV Energy and will purchase energy,
capacity, and/or ancillary services from a provider other than NV Energy. In September 2016, the Company paid an upfront impact payment of $14 million, of which $2
million  was  billed  to  third  party  entities  and  represented  a  reduction  in  the  overall  impact  fee  expense.  Of  this  $2  million  receivable  for  amounts  billed  to  third  party
entities, $1 million is included in Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company is required to make ongoing payments to NV Energy for
non-bypassable rate charges which primarily relate to its share of NV Energy’s portfolio of renewable energy contracts which extend through 2040 and each entity’s share
of the costs of decommissioning and remediation of coal-fired power plants in Nevada. As of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an estimate of such liability on a
discounted basis of $2 million in “Due to MGM Resorts International” and $13 million in “Other long-term obligations.”

Construction
litigation.
In March 2010, Perini, general contractor for CityCenter, filed a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, State of
Nevada,  against  MGM  MIRAGE  Design  Group  (a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  MGM  Resorts  which  was  the  original  party  to  the  Perini  construction  agreement)  and
certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Perini asserted, among other things, that CityCenter was substantially completed, but the defendants failed to pay
Perini approximately $490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and materials expended on CityCenter.

In April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential condominium units (the “Condo
Owner  Defendants”),  added  a  count  for  foreclosure  of  Perini's  recorded  master  mechanic’s  lien  against  the  CityCenter  property  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $491
million, and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the Company, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Company’s lenders in the CityCenter
property.  In November 2012, Perini filed a second amended complaint which, among other things, added claims against the CityCenter defendants of breach of contract
(alleging that CityCenter’s Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) failed to provide adequate project insurance for Perini with broad coverages and high limits),
and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (alleging improper administration by the Company of the OCIP and Builders Risk insurance
programs). Prior to the Final Settlement, as defined below, the Company settled the claims of 219 first-tier Perini subcontractors (including the claims of any lower-tier
subcontractors  that  might  have  claims  through  those  first-tier  subcontractors).  As  a  result  of  these  settlement  agreements  and  the  prior  settlement  agreements  between
Perini and the Company, most but not all of the components of Perini’s non-Harmon-related lien claim against the Company were resolved. On February 24, 2014, Perini
filed a revised lien for $174 million as the amount claimed by Perini and the remaining Harmon-related subcontractors.

During 2013, the Company reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation for
errors or omissions with respect to the CityCenter project, and relevant insurers.  This settlement was approved by the court and the Company received proceeds of $38
million in 2014 related to both the Harmon and other components of the CityCenter project.

In 2014, the Company reached a settlement with builder’s risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the Harmon and received proceeds of $55 million.

In  December  2014,  the  Perini  matter  was    concluded  through  a  global  settlement  among  the  Company,  MGM  Resorts,  Perini,  the  remaining  subcontractors,
including those implicated in the Harmon work (and their affiliates), and relevant insurers, which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an extra-
judicial program for settlement of certain project subcontractor claims. This global settlement concluded all outstanding claims in the case (the “Final Settlement”). The
effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon the Company’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements (which were executed in January
2015) and the Company’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the CityCenter development (which was obtained in January
2015).

The  Final  Settlement,  together  with  previous  settlement  agreements  relating  to  the  non-Harmon  related  lien  claims,    resolved  all  of  Perini’s  and  the  remaining
subcontractors’ lien claims against the Company and MGM Resorts, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, MGM Resorts International Design (formerly known as MGM
MIRAGE  Design  Group),  and  the  Condo  Owner  Defendants.  However,  the  Company  expressly  reserved  any  claims  for  latent  or  hidden  defects  as  to  any  portion  of
CityCenter’s original construction (other than the Harmon) not known to the Company at the time of the agreement.  The Company and MGM Resorts entered into the
Final Settlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault.

15

The key terms of the Final Settlement included:

With respect to its non-Harmon lien claims, Perini waived a specific portion of its lien claim against the Company, which combined with the prior non-Harmon
agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total payment to Perini of $153 million, approximately $14 million of which was paid in December 2014. The total payment to
Perini  was  funded  by  MGM  Resorts  under  their  completion  guarantee  and  included  the  application  of  approximately  $58  million  of  condominium  proceeds  that  were
previously held in escrow by the Company to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the Perini litigation.

The Company’s recovery for its Harmon construction defect claims, when added to the Harmon-related proceeds from prior insurance settlements of $85 million,
resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to the Company of approximately $191 million (of which approximately $18 million was paid by MGM Resorts to CityCenter
under the completion guarantee in February 2015).

In conjunction with the Final Settlement, MGM Resorts and an insurer participating in the OCIP resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurers claim
for payments it made under the OCIP general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the Harmon litigation, premium adjustments and certain other costs and
expenses. MGM Resorts settled this dispute for $38 million, and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in January 2015.

Harmon.
As discussed above, a global settlement was reached in the Perini litigation in December 2014, which finally resolved all outstanding liens, claims and
counterclaims  between  the  Company  and  MGM  Resorts  on  one  hand,  and  Perini,  the  remaining  subcontractors  and  remaining  insurers  on  the  other  hand.  Among  the
matters resolved were the Company’s claims against Perini and other contractors and subcontractors with respect to construction at the Harmon. Pursuant to leave of court
in 2014, the Company commenced demolition of the building. The Company has completed a partial demolition of the building and is currently evaluating options for
further demolition and plans for the future use of the remaining structure. The Company believes the remaining demolition of the Harmon structure if demolished to the
ground level would cost approximately $13 million.

Other
litigation.
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings that relate to construction and development matters and operational matters incidental to its
business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The
Company maintained  an OCIP during the construction  and development  process. Under the OCIP, certain  insurance  coverages  may cover  a portion  of the Company’s
general liability, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities.

Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issued
by financial institutions. The Company’s available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.  At December
31, 2016, the Company had $12 million in letters of credit outstanding.
