"We continue to execute against our profitable growth framework, delivering 17.2% GAAP operating margin and

Forward Looking Guidance

As of August 30, 2023, the Company is initiating its third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance,
current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is raising its full
year FY24 revenue guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin
guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance.

Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible
to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that
reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess
tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and
related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other
transactions.

(1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates.
(2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-
GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS
guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase
program.
(3) Operating Cash Flow Growth guidance includes an estimated 14% - 16% headwind associated with charges from
restructuring.
(4) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior
period ending rates.

The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for
the full year:

(1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP
operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue.
(2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance
for full year FY24.
(3) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection with our
restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023 (the "Restructuring Plan").

(1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 27% for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and
approximately 25% for the year ended January 31, 2024. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related
effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions.
(2) The Company's projected GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment
portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the company’s
strategic investment portfolio could be material.
(3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS has been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection
with the Restructuring Plan.
(4) The Company’s Non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available
information and could be subject to change.
(5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP EPS guidance and Non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any impact to share
count from Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program.

Supplemental Revenue Analysis

Remaining Performance Obligation

Remaining performance obligation ("RPO") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which

includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO is influenced by
several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of software license deliveries, average contract terms
and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of
RPO denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The portion of RPO
that is unbilled is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.

RPO consisted of the following (in billions):

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  This press release includes information about non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP
earnings per share, non-GAAP tax rates, free cash flow, constant currency revenue and constant currency current remaining
performance obligation growth rates (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These non-GAAP financial measures
are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not
meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction
with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and
non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance.

The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors
and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that
supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s
operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s
business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of
supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other
companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.

Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-
GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25
reflects our operating priorities, not specific guidance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 is not
available without unreasonable efforts and has been omitted in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP earnings per share
excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of
purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because
the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-
term benefit over multiple periods.

As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance:

•

•

•

•

•

Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based
compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives.  It is principally aimed at aligning their interests
with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational
performance for any particular period.  Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally
unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.

Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such
as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired Company’s research and development efforts, trade names,
customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-
acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition.  While these intangible assets are continually evaluated
for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by
operations during any particular period.  Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles
from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such
intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.

Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee
notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated
depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses.  The Company excludes these restructuring charges because
they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected
future business performance and operating results.

Gains on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within
the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and
losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP
estimates for future periods, including its guidance.  Gains on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP
financial statements.

Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order
to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in

the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and
frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes
the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles.
The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various
jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company
used a projected non-GAAP tax rate 22.0%. For fiscal 2024, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of
23.5%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax
rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment,
significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the
Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate.

The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying
business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth
rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are
converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the
actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a
constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods
are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date.

The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital
expenditures.
