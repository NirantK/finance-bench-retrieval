CORNING INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and its subsidiary companies.

The consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries consolidated in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented. All intercompany accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”). The results
of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Significant
estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements require the exercise of judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making
estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

The non-controlling interest as recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents amounts attributable to the minority shareholders of Hemlock
Semiconductor Group (“Hemlock”) and other less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no material impact on the results of
operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.

Table of Contents

Customer Deposits

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.  Most of these
customer deposits were non-refundable and allowed customers to secure rights to products produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The
duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to 10 years.  As products are delivered to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and reduce the
amount of the customer deposit liability.

For the three months ended  June 30, 2023 and 2022, customer deposits recognized were $12 million and $48 million, respectively.  For the six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022, customer deposits recognized were $82 million and $131 million, respectively.

Refer to Note 6 (Other Liabilities) for additional information.

Deferred Revenue

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Corning had deferred revenue of approximately $840 million and $869 million, respectively.  Deferred revenue
was primarily related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by Hemlock from its customers under long-term
supply agreements.

Deferred revenue is tracked on a per-customer contract-unit basis. As customers take delivery of the committed volumes under the terms of the contract, a per-
unit amount of deferred revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer based upon the units delivered compared to
the remaining contractual units.  For the three and six months ended  June 30, 2023 and 2022, the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the consolidated
statements of income was not material.

Refer to Note 6 (Other Liabilities) for additional information.

3. Income Taxes

The following table presents the provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rate (in millions, except percentages):

(346)
22.6%

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the United States (“U.S.”) statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to changes
in valuation allowance assessments, partially offset by differences arising from foreign earnings, adjustments to share-based compensation, and a net benefit
due to foreign derived intangible income.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to differences arising from
foreign earnings and changes in tax reserves, partially offset by the impact of changes in tax legislation and adjustments to share-based compensation.

Corning Precision Materials, a South Korean subsidiary, is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2019.
The Company was required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessment. During
the second quarter of 2023, $99 million was no longer under dispute and was refunded to the Company. The non-current receivable balance was $256 million
and $349 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government.  Corning believes
that it is more likely than not the Company will prevail in the appeals process relating to these matters.

Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $7.1 billion and $6.1 billion
as of  June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the carrying value of $7.4 billion and $6.7 billion as of  June 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, respectively. The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing
debt traded in the secondary market.

On May 15, 2023, the Company issued €300 million 3.875% Notes due 2026 (“2026 Notes”) and €550 million 4.125% Notes due 2031 (“2031 Notes”). The
proceeds from the 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes were received in euros and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received were
approximately $918 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023, the U.S. dollar equivalent carrying value of the euro-
denominated long-term debt was $920 million.

The full amounts of the 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes have been designated as net investment hedges against our investments in certain European subsidiaries
with euro functional currencies.  Refer to Note 10 (Hedging Activities) for additional information.

Corning had no outstanding commercial paper as of June 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are
summarized below. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s
consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.

Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters

Until June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”).
On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning. Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in
Dow Corning. With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow for 50% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent
such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits.  Corning does not believe
that its indemnity obligation will be material.

Dow Corning Environmental Claims

In September 2019, Dow formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow asserts that it has, or will, experience losses arising from
remediation and response at a number of sites.  In the event Dow is liable for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to 50% of that
liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.  As of June 30, 2023, Corning has determined a potential liability for these environmental matters is probable
and the amount reserved was not material.

Environmental Litigation

Corning has been designated by federal or state governments under environmental laws, including Superfund, as a potentially responsible party that may be
liable for cleanup costs associated with 19 hazardous waste sites.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to such hazardous waste sites
and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external
consultants.  As of  June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Corning had accrued approximately $94 million and $109 million, respectively, for the estimated
undiscounted liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability.

10. Hedging Activities

Designated Hedges

Corning uses over-the-counter (“OTC”) foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the risk that movements in exchange
rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers. The total notional amounts for
foreign currency cash flow hedges are $310 million and $419 million as of  June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, with maturities through 2024.
Corning defers gains and losses related to cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until the hedged
item impacts earnings. As of  June 30, 2023, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax gain of $41 million.

Corning has entered into leases of precious metals, with maturities through 2025. To offset the risk of changes in the fair value of the Company’s separate
accounting pool of leased precious metals due to adverse changes in the respective market prices, Corning designated the bifurcated embedded derivatives
included in these leases as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the
hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings. The amounts representing the time value component of the derivatives are excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness and amortized in earnings. The impact of the excluded component on Corning’s other comprehensive loss and earnings is not material. The
carrying amount of the leased precious metals pool, which is included within property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation in the
consolidated balance sheets, is $104 million and $278 million, respectively, as of  June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The carrying amount of the leased
precious metals pool includes cumulative fair value losses of $269 million and $95 million as of  June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These
losses are offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives.

Net Investment Hedges

In May 2023, the Company designated the full amount of its 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes with a total notional amount of €850 million, which are non-
derivative financial instruments, as net investment hedges against our investments in certain European subsidiaries with euro functional currencies. Changes in
the value of these hedging instruments due to foreign currency gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated statements of
comprehensive (loss) income, within the foreign currency translation adjustments and other line, and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until
the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated. We evaluate the effectiveness of the net investment hedges each quarter using the critical term match
method.  As of  June 30, 2023, the net investment hedges are deemed to be effective.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the loss recognized
in other comprehensive loss was not material.

Refer to Note 7 (Debt) for additional information.

Undesignated Hedges

Corning uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts to offset economic currency risks. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments
for accounting purposes. The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary
liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.

A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenue and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese
yuan and euro. When this revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements. To protect
translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and option contracts. Most of these
contracts hedge a significant portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen, with maturities through 2024, and South Korean won, with maturities
through 2026.

includes the value of the put and call options. However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, only the put or call option can be exercised at maturity.

The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes
in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded in earnings within translated earnings contract gain, net in the consolidated statements of income.

12. Shareholders’ Equity

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

We had 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Preferred Stock”) as of December 31, 2020. On January
16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million common shares. On April 5, 2021, we executed a Share Repurchase Agreement (“SRA”)
with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (“SDC”) and the Preferred Stock was fully converted as of April 8, 2021. Immediately following the conversion, we
repurchased and retired 35 million of the common shares held by SDC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion, of which approximately
$507 million was paid in April 2022 and 2021. The remaining payment of approximately $507 million was made in April 2023.

Share Repurchase Program

In 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common stock (“2019 Authorization”).

During the three and six months ended  June 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares and 5.5 million shares, respectively, of common stock on
the open market for approximately $53 million and $204 million, respectively, as part of its 2019 Authorization. No shares were purchased on the open market
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

As of June 30, 2023, approximately $3.3 billion remains available under the Company's 2019 Authorization.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily related to the foreign currency

14. Reportable Segments

The Company has determined that it has five reportable segments for financial reporting purposes, as follows:

● Optical Communications – manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry; the carrier network

group consists primarily of products and solutions for optical-based communications infrastructure for services such as video, data and voice
communications, and the enterprise network group consists primarily of optical-based communication networks sold to businesses, governments and
individuals for their own use.

● Display Technologies – manufactures high quality glass substrates for flat panel displays, including liquid crystal displays and organic light-emitting

●

●
●

diodes that are used primarily in televisions, notebook computers, desktop monitors, tablets and handheld devices.
Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique
customer needs across a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets, including materials optimized for mobile consumer electronics, semiconductor
equipment optics and consumables, aerospace and defense optics, radiation shielding products, sunglasses and telecommunications components.
Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filter products for emissions control systems in mobile applications.
Life Sciences – develops, manufactures, and supplies laboratory products, including labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents, enabling workflow
solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.

All other businesses that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses.  The
net sales for this group are primarily attributable to Hemlock, which is an operating segment that produces solar and semiconductor products.  The emerging
growth businesses primarily consist of Pharmaceutical Technologies, Auto Glass Solutions and the Emerging Innovations Group.

18

Table of Contents

Financial results for the reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation
of financial information to assist the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in making internal operating decisions. As a significant portion of segment
revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on segment net
sales and segment net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars.  Therefore, the Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for the Display
Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact on segment sales and segment net
income from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment.  The most significant constant-
currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment.  Management utilizes constant-currency reporting based on
internally-derived rates, as detailed below, which are closely aligned with the currencies we have hedged.

The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand segment results without the volatility of currency
fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts.  Further, it reflects the underlying economics of the
translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.

Constant-currency rates are as follows and are applied to all periods presented:

Currency
Rate

Japanese yen
¥107

Korean won
₩1,175

Chinese yuan
¥6.7

New Taiwan dollar
NT$31

Euro
€.81

In addition, certain income and expenses are excluded from segment net income and included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable
segment net income to consolidated net income. These items are not used by the CODM in allocating resources or evaluating the results of the segments and
include the following: the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt; the impact of the translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs;
certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits; certain litigation, regulatory and other
legal matters; pension mark-to-market adjustments; and other non-recurring non-operational items. Although these amounts are excluded from segment results,
they are included in reported consolidated results.

Corning’s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis and such costs and expenses are allocated among the segments differently than
they would be for stand-alone financial reporting purposes. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human
resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. Expenses that are not allocated to the segments are included in the reconciliation of reportable segment
net income to consolidated net income. Segment net income  may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

OVERVIEW

Corning Incorporated is central to the advancement of the industries we serve and secular trends touching many facets of daily life. It all starts with our focused
and cohesive portfolio. We maintain clear leadership in three core technologies and four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms. We apply new
combinations of our assets and capabilities to solve a broad range of significant challenges and shape new industries in tandem with our customers. By
reapplying and repurposing our insights and assets across multiple opportunities and markets, we increase our profitably. Importantly, as we partner closely
with our customers to realize their visions and help solve their toughest technology challenges, we unlock new ways to integrate more of our content into their
ecosystems. This “More Corning” approach provides a powerful value-creation lever. We’re not just relying on people buying more stuff; we’re driving more
Corning content into the products they’re already buying.

Our accomplishments over the past several years illustrate the efficacy of our approach. Despite the challenging external environment, we have advanced fiber-
to-the-home and data center solutions in Optical Communications, delivered on our gasoline particulate filter content opportunity in Environmental
Technologies, introduced Ceramic Shield with Apple in Specialty Materials and ramped our Gen 10.5 plants to extend our leadership in Display Technologies.
In addition, we made major progress on our emerging innovations; we gained significant traction in our Automotive Glass Solutions business; and our
pharmaceutical packaging portfolio played a central role in combatting the global pandemic. These achievements have helped extend our leadership positions
across our markets and pave the way for future growth.

At the same time, profitability and cash flow have lagged sales growth. Since 2020, the external environment has been characterized by the impact of the
pandemic and its resulting effects including supply chain disruptions, large swings in consumer spending and inflation. Our core priorities throughout this
period were protecting our people and delivering for our customers, and as a result, we operated with elevated staffing and higher-than-normal inventory levels
during this period leading to reduced productivity. In addition, persistent inflation added to the cost of raw materials we purchased, the cost to produce and ship
our products and the inventory we maintained.

22

Table of Contents

In response, we took a series of actions to improve profitability and cash generation throughout 2022 and into 2023. We took multiple additional actions,
including raising prices across our businesses to more appropriately share inflationary costs with our customers; restoring our productivity to pre-pandemic
levels without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth; and normalizing inventory levels. We expect these actions to improve profitability and
cash flow throughout 2023, and they began delivering notable results in the first half of 2023.

Overall, we will continue to focus on operating each of our businesses well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment while simultaneously advancing
growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive continued success as the global economy stabilizes. Our focused and cohesive portfolio provides strategic
resilience that is evident in our results, even in the current environment. We remain confident in our relevance to long-term secular trends and our “More
Corning” approach, and we are well positioned to capture durable, profitable growth as the global economy improves.

Third-Quarter 2023 Corporate Outlook

We expect core net sales of approximately $3.5 billion for the third quarter of 2023.

Net Sales

Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased $372 million, or 10%, when compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily
driven by decreased segment sales in Optical Communications of $247 million, Life Sciences of $81 million, and Specialty Materials of $62 million, partially
offset by increased segment sales in Environmental Technologies of $101 million and Display Technologies of $50 million. In addition, movements in foreign
exchange rates adversely impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales by $79 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, when compared to the same
period in 2022.

Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased $874 million, or 12%, when compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily
driven by decreased segment sales in Optical Communications of $320 million, Specialty Materials of $149 million, Display Technologies of $146 million, and
Life Sciences of $135 million, partially offset by increased segment sales in Environmental Technologies of $123 million. In addition, movements in foreign
exchange rates adversely impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales by $195 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, when compared to the same
period in 2022.

Refer to the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A below for a discussion of net sales by segment.

Cost of Sales / Gross Margin

The types of expenses included in cost of sales are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits;
depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance;
inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; freight and logistics costs; and
other production overhead.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, gross margin decreased by $233 million and $513 million, or 19% and 20%, respectively, and declined as a
percentage of sales by 3 and 4 percentage points, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2022. The decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales
was primarily driven by higher inflationary and production costs as well as incremental severance and asset write-offs and related charges of $36 million and
$65 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates
adversely impacted Corning’s consolidated gross margin by $42 million and $117 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, when
compared to the same periods in 2022.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are salaries, wages and benefits; share-based compensation
expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $46 million and $59 million, or 9% and 6%,
respectively, and were fairly consistent as a percentage of sales when compared to the same periods in 2022.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $23 million and $29 million, or 10%, and 6%,
respectively, and were fairly consistent as a percentage of sales when compared to the same periods in 2022.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, amount includes pre-tax realized losses of $14 million and $28 million, respectively, related to the expiration of option contracts.  For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, amount includes pre-tax realized losses of $7 million and $14 million, respectively, related to the expiration of option contracts.  These amounts were
reflected within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, amount excludes $11 million related to a forward contract designated as a net investment hedge, which was reflected within investing
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The impact to income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by unrealized gains from our Japanese yen-denominated hedges offset by unrealized
losses from our South Korean won-denominated hedges. The three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was further impacted by unrealized losses from our Chinese yuan-denominated hedges.

Income Before Income Taxes

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current period,
adversely impacted Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes by $55 million and $95 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2022.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to changes in valuation
allowance assessments, partially offset by differences arising from foreign earnings, adjustments to share-based compensation, and a net benefit due to foreign
derived intangible income.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to differences arising from
foreign earnings and changes in tax reserves, partially offset by the impact of changes in tax legislation and adjustments to share-based compensation.

Comprehensive loss attributable to Corning Incorporated for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $21 million compared to $169 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2022. This movement is primarily due to the $282 million decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated and a decrease in
net losses on foreign currency translation adjustments of $332 million, primarily driven by the Japanese yen, South Korean won and euro.

Comprehensive income attributable to Corning Incorporated for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $88 million compared to $225 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to the $687 million decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated and a decrease in
net losses on foreign currency translation adjustments of $448 million, primarily driven by the Japanese yen, South Korean won and euro.

(1) Refer to Note 14 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net sales.

Optical Communications
The decrease in segment net sales for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by a decline in sales volume for carrier and enterprise products
due to the timing of customer projects.

Display Technologies
The decrease in segment net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is due to lower volumes, primarily
attributable to the slow recovery of panel maker utilization. As panel makers started to increase utilization at the end of the first quarter, improvement
continued in the second quarter resulting in an increase in segment net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven by higher volume.

Specialty Materials
The decrease in segment net sales for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by lower demand in the smartphone, tablet and notebook
markets, partially offset by continued demand for advanced optics.

Environmental Technologies
The increase in segment net sales for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by increased demand of automotive products,
including gasoline particulate filters as well as continued demand for heavy-duty diesel products.

Life Sciences
The decrease in segment net sales for both the three and six month periods was impacted by the lower demand for COVID-related products and the impact of
customers drawing down their inventory.

Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses
The decrease in segment net sales for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by a decrease in our Hemlock business due to a decline in
solar-grade polysilicon spot prices.

(1) Refer to Note 14 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net income.

Optical Communications
The decrease in segment net income for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by a decline in sales volume, as outlined above, partially
offset by improvements from pricing and productivity actions.

Display Technologies
The decrease in segment net income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by higher
inflationary and production costs, partially offset by the increase in sales, as outlined above. The decrease in segment net income for the six months ended June
30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by lower volume, as outlined above, and higher inflationary and production costs.

Specialty Materials
The decrease in segment net income for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by the decline in sales volume, as outlined above, and
impacted by continued development costs for new product launches.

Environmental Technologies
The increase in segment net income for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by the increase in sales, as outlined above.

Life Sciences
The decrease in segment net income for both the three and six month periods was primarily driven by lower sales volume, as outlined above, and the impact of
reducing our production levels.

Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses
The increase in segment net income for the six month period was primarily driven by our Pharmaceutical Technologies business, due to improvements resulting
from productivity actions, and partially offset by a decrease in our Hemlock business due to lower sales, as outlined above.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude
specific items to arrive at our core performance measures. These items include the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt, the impact of the
translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges
and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing
operating results of the Company.

In addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is
important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency
reporting for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese
yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to
the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. We establish constant-currency rates based on internally derived management estimates,
which are closely aligned with the currencies we have hedged. For details of the rates used, please see the footnotes to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Measures” section.

We believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze
underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. Further, we believe it reflects the underlying economics of the translated
earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.

Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, but management believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors
with greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  We believe investors should consider
these non-GAAP measures in evaluating results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates operational
results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the outlook for future
periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies
against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management’s
control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Measures.”

Core Net Income

For the three months ended June 30, 2023, we generated core net income of $388 million, or $0.45 per core diluted share, compared to core net income
generated for the three months ended June 30, 2022 of $489 million, or $0.57 per core diluted share.  The decrease of $101 million, or $0.12 per core diluted
share, was primarily due to lower segment net income for Specialty Materials of $58 million, Optical Communications of $42 million, Life Sciences of $26
million and Display Technologies of $20 million. This was partially offset by higher segment net income for Environmental Technologies of $45 million.
Segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses net sales and variances are discussed in detail in the “Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A.

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we generated core net income of $738 million, or $0.86 per core diluted share, compared to core net income generated
for the six months ended June 30, 2022 of $954 million, or $1.11 per core diluted share.  The decrease of $216 million, or $0.25 per core diluted share, was
primarily due to lower segment net income for Display Technologies of $96 million, Specialty Materials of $94 million, Life Sciences of $59 million and
Optical Communications of $49 million. This was partially offset by higher segment net income for Environmental Technologies of $53 million and Hemlock
and Emerging Growth Businesses of $25 million. Segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses net sales and variances are discussed in detail in the
“Segment Analysis” section of our MD&A.

Core Earnings per Common Share

Core earnings per share decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 to $0.45 and $0.86 per share, respectively, primarily as a result of the
changes in core net income, outlined above.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating
performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject
to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in
the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including
amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or
statements of cash flows.

Core net sales and core net income and the related per share numbers are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by management to analyze financial
performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends
in our operations.

See “Items Excluded from GAAP Measures” for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.

Items Excluded from GAAP Measures

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures were as follows:

(1)

Constant-currency adjustment: As a significant portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management
believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. The Company utilizes constant-
currency reporting for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen,
South Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and euro, as applicable to the segment.

Japanese yen
¥107

Korean won
₩1,175

Chinese yuan

(2)
(3)

Translation of Japanese yen-denominated debt: Amount reflects the gain or loss on the translation of our yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars.
Translated earnings contract: Amount reflects the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the Japanese yen, South Korean won,
Chinese yuan, euro and new Taiwan dollar-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses
of our British pound-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings.

(4) Acquisition-related costs: Amount reflects intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs, as well

as other transaction related costs.

(5) Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: Amount reflects certain discrete period tax items such as changes in tax law, the impact of tax

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

audits, changes in tax reserves and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as well as other tax-related adjustments.
Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits: Amount reflects certain restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits, as well
as other expenses, including accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and facility repairs resulting from power outages, which are not related to ongoing
operations.
Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Amount reflects developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes, adjustments to our
estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.
Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Amount primarily reflects defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in
actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
Loss on investments: Amount primarily reflects the gain or loss recognized on investment due to mark-to-mark adjustments for the change in fair value
or the disposition of the investment.

(10) Contingent consideration:  Amount reflects the fair value mark-to-market cost adjustment of contingent consideration resulting from the Hemlock

Semiconductor Group transaction on September 9, 2020.

(11) Gain on sale of assets: Amount represents the gain recognized for the sale assets.
(12) Gain on sale of business:  Amount represents the gain recognized for the sale of a business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our financial condition and liquidity are strong. We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or
that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable
or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix of such resources.

Our major source of funding for 2023 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any
issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and meet our obligations for the foreseeable future. Such obligations include
requirements for acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs. We will continue to
generate cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as discussed in more detail below.

Key Balance Sheet Data

We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, when necessary. In addition, we receive
upfront cash from customers relating to long-term supply agreements, as well as cash incentives from government entities generally for capital expansion and
related expenses.

We perform comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more
frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer
credit issues. We are not aware of any customer credit issues that could have a material impact on our liquidity.

We participate in accounts receivable management programs, including factoring arrangements to sell certain accounts receivable to third-party financial
institutions or accelerate collections through our customer's supply chain financing arrangements. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of
accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of
cash flows. By utilizing these types of programs, we have accelerated the collection of $435 million and $423 million of accounts receivable during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.  We believe these accounts receivables would have been collected
during the normal course of business in the following quarter.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $722 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily driven by a decrease in net income of $693 million.

Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 improved by $52 million when compared to the same period last year, primarily
driven by a $45 million increase in realized gains on translated earnings contracts.

Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 improved by $1,014 million when compared to the same period last year, primarily
driven by the $918 million proceeds from the issuance of euro-denominated notes in May 2023.

As of June 30, 2023, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are
generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As of June 30,
2023, approximately 50% of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S.

If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes. We do not
foresee a need to repatriate any earnings for which we asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international
subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested.

Debt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity

We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal
amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, we may issue paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate
purposes. As of June 30, 2023, we did not have outstanding commercial paper.

Our $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, if
needed. In addition, we have a 25 billion Japanese yen liquidity facility, equivalent to approximately $173 million. As of June 30, 2023, there were no amounts
outstanding under these facilities.

Table of Contents

Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial
covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. As of June 30, 2023, our leverage using this measure was approximately 39%. As of June 30,
2023, we were in compliance.

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of
certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one
debt obligation, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all such
provisions.

We have access to certain unsecured variable rate loan facilities, with an aggregate capacity of 5,045 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to approximately
$696 million, whose proceeds are used for capital investment and general corporate purposes.  As of June 30, 2023, borrowings totaled $327 million.

As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the SEC on December
4, 2020. Under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. We plan
to file a new shelf registration statement in the fourth quarter of 2023, prior to the expiration of the shelf registration statement currently in effect.

On May 15, 2023, the Company issued €300 million 3.875% Notes due 2026 (“2026 Notes”) and €550 million 4.125% Notes due 2031 (“2031 Notes”). The
proceeds from the 2026 Notes and 2031 Notes were received in euros and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received were
approximately $918 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023, the U.S. dollar equivalent carrying value of the euro-
denominated long-term debt was $920 million.

Uses of Cash

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

We had 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Preferred Stock”) as of December 31, 2020. On January
16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million common shares. On April 5, 2021, we executed a Share Repurchase Agreement (“SRA”)
with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (“SDC”) and the Preferred Stock was fully converted as of April 8, 2021. Immediately following the conversion, we
repurchased and retired 35 million of the common shares held by SDC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion, of which approximately
$507 million was paid in April 2022 and 2021. The remaining payment of approximately $507 million was made in April 2023.

Stock Repurchases

In 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common stock (“2019 Authorization”). As of June 30, 2023, approximately $3.3 billion
remains available under our 2019 Authorization, which does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any
time without prior notice.

On June 21, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock. The dividend will be payable on September 28,
2023. The Board’s decision to declare and pay future dividends will depend on our income and liquidity position, among other factors. We expect to declare
quarterly dividends and fund payments with cash from operations.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $770 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.  We expect our 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower
than 2022.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 82% funded as of December 31, 2022. Our largest single pension plan is our
U.S. qualified plan, which accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation, was 93% funded as of December
31, 2022.

The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon multiple factors including actuarial assumptions, interest rates at year-end, prior investment returns
and contributions made to the plans. During 2023, the Company anticipates making cash contributions of $25 million to the international pension plans.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the obligations disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K under the caption “Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees.”

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in off balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K under the caption

ENVIRONMENT

Refer to Item 1. Legal Proceedings or Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for
information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates that
are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that
could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Since the date of the
Company's most recent Annual Report, there were no material changes in the Company's critical accounting estimates or assumptions.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on
Forms 10-Q and 8-K and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” “target,” “estimate,” “forecast” or similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such
statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. These forward-looking statements relate to,
among other things, the Company’s future operating performance, the Company’s share of new and existing markets, the Company's revenue and earnings
growth rates, the Company’s ability to innovate and commercialize new products, the Company's expected capital expenditure and the Company’s
implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the Company’s manufacturing capacity.

Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, current estimates
and forecasts, general economic conditions, its knowledge of its business and key performance indicators that impact the Company, there can be no assurance
that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such
statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s estimates or opinions should
change except as required by applicable securities laws.

Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to:

- global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks, or an escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other countries, and

related impacts on our businesses' global supply chains and strategies;

- changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including developments and volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, interest rates,
the value of securities and other financial assets, precious metals, oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and exchange rates (particularly between the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and South Korean won), the availability of government incentives, decreases or sudden increases of consumer demand,
and the impact of such changes and volatility on our financial position and businesses;

- the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact across our businesses on demand, personnel, operations, our global supply chains and stock price;
- possible disruption in commercial activities or our supply chain due to terrorist activity, cyber-attack, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural disasters,

international trade disputes or major health concerns;

- loss of intellectual property due to theft, cyber-attack, or disruption to our information technology infrastructure;
- ability to enforce patents and protect intellectual property and trade secrets;
- unanticipated disruption to Corning’s, our suppliers’ and manufacturers’ supply chain, equipment, facilities, IT systems or operations;
- product demand and industry capacity;
- competitive products and pricing;
- availability and costs of critical components, materials, equipment, natural resources and utilities;
- new product development and commercialization;
- order activity and demand from major customers;
- the amount and timing of our cash flows and earnings and other conditions, which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level or to repurchase

shares at planned levels;

- the amount and timing of any future dividends;
- the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions;
- the effect of regulatory and legal developments;
- ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand;
- our ability to increase margins through implementation of operational changes, pricing actions and cost reduction measures;
- rate of technology change;
- adverse litigation;
- product and component performance issues;
- retention of key personnel;
- customer ability to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund ongoing operations and manufacturing expansions and pay receivables when due;
- loss of significant customers;
- changes in tax laws, regulations and international tax standards;
- the impacts of audits by taxing authorities; and
- the potential impact of legislation, government regulations, and other government action and investigations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As noted in the 2022 Form 10-K, we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:

●
●

Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and
Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk and how we mitigate that risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risks, contained in the 2022 Form 10-K.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of and with the participation of Corning’s management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of June 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, we have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

An evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting was performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. The chief executive officer and
chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

PART II

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are
summarized in Note 9 (Commitments and Contingencies) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management,
the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or
results of operations, is remote.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in Corning’s
2022 Form 10-K, which could materially impact the Company’s business, financial condition or future results. Risks disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K are not
the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may materially adversely
impact Corning’s business, financial condition or operating results.
