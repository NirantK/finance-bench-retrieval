Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to
future business, future results of operations or financial condition, new or planned features or services, management strategies or timing and other
expectations regarding our sale of StubHub to viagogo). You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as “may,” “will,” “would,”
“should,”  “could,”  “expect,”  “anticipate,”  “believe,”  “estimate,”  “intend,”  “plan”  and  other  similar  expressions.  These  forward-looking  statements

statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  or  the  SEC.  We  do  not  intend,  and  undertake  no  obligation,  to  update  any  of  our  forward-looking
statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

ITEM 1: BUSINESS

Overview

eBay  Inc.  was  formed  as  a  sole  proprietorship  in  September  1995  and  was  incorporated  in  California  in  May  1996.  In  April  1998,  we
reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are
located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7008. Unless otherwise expressly stated or
the  context  otherwise  requires,  when  we  refer  to  “we,”  “our,”  “us”  or  “eBay”  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  we  mean  eBay  Inc.  and  its
consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. On November 24, 2019, we
entered into a definitive agreement for eBay to sell StubHub to viagogo, with closing of the transaction expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020.

eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millions
of buyers and sellers around the world, empowering people and creating opportunity. Our technologies and services are designed to give buyers
choice  and  a  breadth  of  relevant  inventory  and  to  enable  sellers  worldwide  to  organize  and  offer  their  inventory  for  sale,  virtually  anytime  and
anywhere.  Our  Marketplace  platforms  include  our  online  marketplace  located  at  www.ebay.com,  its  localized  counterparts,  including  off-platform
businesses in Korea, Japan and Turkey and the eBay suite of mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’s largest and most vibrant
marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. StubHub platforms include the online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, its
localized counterparts and the StubHub mobile apps. These platforms connect fans with their favorite sporting events, shows and artists and enable
them to buy and sell millions of tickets annually, whenever and wherever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands such as
mobile.de,  Kijiji,  Gumtree,  Marktplaats,  eBay  Kleinanzeigen  and  others.  Offering  online  classifieds  around  the  world,  these  platforms  help  people
find what they are looking for in their local communities.

Our platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience (e.g., desktop and laptop computers), mobile devices (e.g., smartphones
and tablets) and our application programming interfaces or APIs (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-screen approach
offers downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of our other websites
and vertical shopping experiences. Our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-standard ways for software
developers and merchants to access our APIs and develop software and solutions for commerce. In 2019, we launched new API capabilities to give
third-party developers access to eBay programs like managed payments.

Agreement to Sell StubHub

On November 24, 2019, following a strategic review of our assets, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell StubHub to viagogo for a
purchase price of $4.05 billion in cash. Please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “The closing of the proposed sale of
StubHub is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with expected plans or on the currently contemplated
timeline, or at all, and the pending sale may be disruptive to StubHub.”

Our Strategy

Delivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform

Our strategy is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We focus on
connecting buyers and sellers through simplified experiences to make it easier for users to list, buy and sell items, and we are working to serve our
customers in an authentically eBay way.

On our Marketplace  platform,  our strategy  is to  drive  the best  choice by attracting  and retaining  sellers  and brands  that bring differentiated
inventory to eBay and provide our consumers with great selection and value. This includes new, everyday items as well as rare and unique goods,
many of which are available with free shipping and delivery in three business days or less. Our vision is to provide buyers with value and selection
through the spectrum of value of the inventory. We continue to invest in product and initiatives to evolve the customer experience, making it easier
for buyers to find inventory on the platform.

As a trusted ticket marketplace, StubHub brings the joy of live events to fans globally. In 2019, over 268 million visitors came to StubHub to
buy or sell tickets to live sports, music, theater and other events. StubHub business partners include more than 100 leagues, teams, venues, events
or other major third-party companies in the U.S. and internationally across major sports leagues such as the NFL, MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, and the
NCAA. StubHub is a leader in mobile innovation, with roughly 60% of its orders coming from mobile in 2019.

A world leader in online classifieds, eBay Classifieds is designed to help people list their products and services, generally for free, find what
they  are  looking  for  in  their  local  communities  and  trade  at  a  local  level.  eBay  Classifieds  Group’s  brands  offer  both  horizontal  and  vertical
experiences, such as motors, real estate and jobs. We offer a personalized classifieds experience and focus on expanding our value proposition by
leveraging data and analytics to improve customer relevance and grow the classifieds opportunity on mobile.

Business model and pricing

On  eBay  and  StubHub,  our  business  model  and  pricing  are  designed  so  that  our  business  is  successful  primarily  when  our  sellers  are
successful. We make money primarily through fees collected on successfully closed sales. On our Classifieds platform, we monetize our business
primarily through advertising.

In 2019, managed payments adoption accelerated in the U.S. and the service launched in Germany. Since we began intermediating payments
in  2018,  we  processed  over  $2.0  billion  in  payments  for  nearly  25,000  sellers  through  December  31,  2019.  Our  advertising  business  remains
focused on growing our promoted listing fees (first-party advertising business) while reducing non-strategic third-party advertising in a manner that is
conducive to growth in our core Marketplace; over 1 million sellers used the product, promoting over 320 million live listings in 2019.

Our offerings for buyers and sellers

We  provide  a  number  of  features  for  our  buyers  and  sellers  that  are  designed  to  build  trust,  help  users  feel  more  comfortable  buying  and
selling  on  our  platforms  and reward  our  top  sellers  for  their  loyalty.  We believe  that,  through  our  sellers,  eBay  offers  some  of  the  best  value  and
deals available for a number of consumer products. Buyers seek out eBay because they can find an enormous breadth of inventory and a spectrum
of value from the brand new to the hard-to-find.

On the Marketplace platform, we continue to explore new tools and features that are intended to create a better buying experience on eBay,

including Visual Shopping via Computer Vision, Right Offer at the Right Time, and Buy Again.

In  order  to  remain  competitive  and  create  a  vibrant  seller  experience,  eBay  continuously  invests  in  tools  and  programs  to  grow  the  seller
ecosystem  because  we  only  win  when  our  sellers  succeed.  In  2019,  we  added  analytics  and  merchandising  tools  to  our  Seller  Hub  that  are
designed  so  that  sellers  know  what  to  sell,  when  to  sell  it  and  at  what  price.  The  2019  additions  of  Multi-User  Account  Access,  along  with  the
Terapeak integration, enable sellers to better manage their business and add additional analytics insights into the platform. We also established new
seller protections, including two new financial protections for top-rated sellers located in the U.S. who offer 30-day returns. First, eBay will issue a
seller invoice credit to cover return label cost if a buyer makes a false “item not as described”

5

claim. Second, eBay now allows these sellers to issue partial refunds for all items that are returned damaged. eBay also has processes that allow
sellers to report buyers who violate policies.

eBay  is  committed  to  maintaining  a  safe  and  trusted  marketplace.  In  order  to  further  strengthen  our  buyers’  confidence  and  trust  in  our
services, we offer eBay Money Back Guarantee, which allows buyers to get their money back if the item they ordered does not arrive, is faulty or
damaged,  or  if  it  does  not  match  the  listing.  eBay  Money  Back  Guarantee  covers  most  items  purchased  on  the  eBay  platform  in  a  number  of
countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia, through a qualifying payment method. Some purchases, including some vehicles, are
not covered. We also offer eBay Authenticate, through which sellers can have their high-end handbags, luxury watches and jewelry authenticated.
The program  is available in the United States as well as in the U.K. and Germany.  We also provide our customers  with a Best Price Guarantee,
which offers buyers in the United States 110 percent of the price difference if they find an item for less on a competitor’s website within 48 hours of
making a purchase. In Australia, Best Price Guarantee beats deals from approved retailers by 5%, and in U.K., offers price matching.

For buyers, we want to create greater confidence in our ability to meet their delivery and buying expectations and to improve the reliability of
our shipping times and tracking. The majority of our transactions on the eBay Marketplace in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany include free shipping,
and we encourage sellers to offer free returns. Through eBay Guaranteed Delivery, we provide faster and more precise delivery dates on millions of
eligible items.

Our Impact and Responsibility

eBay’s purpose is to empower people and create economic opportunity for all. Every day, people build businesses on eBay, and we are driven
to support them. Both in our community and through our technology, we work to create economic opportunity. Our impact efforts are divided into
four programs that align with our purpose: eBay for Charity, eBay Foundation, Retail Revival, and Responsible Business.

eBay  for  Charity  empowers  eBay  buyers  and  sellers  to  support  charities  around  the  world.  Since  its  inception,  eBay  for  Charity  has  raised

more than $1 billion for more than 83,000 charities.

eBay’s  Foundation  helps  build  economically  vibrant  and  thriving  communities  through  several  key  initiatives  like  Global  Give,  which  is  an
annual  employee-led  grantmaking  program  that  deploys  the  talents  and  passions  of  eBay  employees.  Through  the  program,  employees  come
together to create teams, partner with local nonprofits, and develop projects that support small businesses and entrepreneurs in their communities.
In 2019, the eBay Foundation awarded approximately $1 million through Global Give.

Retail Revival, which launched in early 2018, also demonstrates eBay’s commitment to economic development and entrepreneurialism. Retail
Revival empowers local businesses to compete on a global scale and thrive in an online economy. In close partnership with local governments and
stakeholders, eBay onboards cohorts of small businesses and supports their growth through months of in-depth training, individual coaching, and
promotional  support,  all  provided  at  no  cost  to  the  participants  or  partner  cities.  Since  launch,  eBay  has  welcomed  new  U.S.  cities  to  the  Retail
Revival program, including: Lansing, Michigan; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and scaled the program internationally to
Canada, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Russia, and Bulgaria.

Finally, as a part of the company’s Responsible Business efforts, eBay strives to operate in an environmentally and socially sustainable way -
creating a safe, trusted, and diverse environment in which our employees, buyers, sellers, suppliers, and partners can thrive. In 2019, eBay made
several  partnership  announcements,  working  to  reach  its  goal  of  100%  renewable  energy  by  2025.  This  includes  two  local  renewable  energy
programs  with  energy  providers  in  Draper,  Utah,  and  San  Jose,  California.  These  two  locations  join  Dreilinden,  Germany;  Dublin,  Ireland;  and
Portland, Oregon in 100% renewable energy sourcing.

Financial Information

We measure our footprint in our addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”). GMV consists of the total value of all
successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace  or StubHub platforms  during the applicable period, regardless of whether the
buyer  and  seller  actually  completed  the  transaction.  In  2019,  we  generated  over  $90  billion  in  GMV,  of  which  approximately  60  percent was
generated outside the U.S. Despite GMV’s divergence from revenue during 2019, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall
volume of closed transactions that flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are
not ultimately consummated.

At the end of 2019, our Marketplace and StubHub platforms had more than 180 million active buyers and over one billion live listings globally.
The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyer accounts that successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace or StubHub platforms
within the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.

We  generate  revenue  primarily  from  the  transactions  we  successfully  enable  and  through  marketing  services,  including  classifieds  and  our
growth  initiatives  of  payments  and  advertising.  The  majority  of  our  revenue  comes  from  a  take  rate  on  the  GMV  of  transactions  closed  on  our
Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We define “take rate” as net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

The  size  and  scale  of  our  platforms  are  designed  to  enable  our  buyers  and  sellers  to  leverage  our  economies  of  scale  and  capital

investments, such as in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition, technology innovation and customer service.

Notable Business Transactions in 2019

We  regularly  review  and  manage  our  investments  to  ensure  that  they  support  eBay’s  strategic  direction  and  complement  our  disciplined
approach  to  value  creation,  profitability  and  capital  allocation.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  Motors.co.uk,  a  U.K.-
based classifieds site, for $93 million. The Motors.co.uk team joined Gumtree UK, an eBay Classifieds business. In the second quarter of 2019, we
invested $160 million in Paytm Mall, an eCommerce marketplace in India. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell
StubHub; see “Agreement to Sell StubHub” section for more details.

Competition

We encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can list, sell, buy, and pay for similar items through a
variety of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export
companies,  auctioneers,  catalog  and  mail-order  companies,  classifieds,  directories,  search  engines,  commerce  participants  (consumer-to-
consumer,  business-to-consumer and  business-to-business), shopping channels and  networks.  As  our  product offerings  continue to  broaden into
new  categories  of  items  and  new  commerce  formats,  we  expect  to  face  additional  competition  from  other  online,  mobile  and  offline  channels  for
those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and services, and global scale.

For  more  information  regarding  risks  of  competition,  see  the  information  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “Substantial  and
increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation
under competition laws that could adversely impact our business.”

To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantial
expenditures,  which  could  reduce  our  margins  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  position,  operating  results  and  cash
flows  and  reduce  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  and  outstanding  debt  securities.  Despite  our  efforts  to  preserve  and  expand  the  size,
diversity  and  transaction  activity  of  our  buyers  and  sellers  and  to  enhance  the  user  experience,  we  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  manage  our
operating expenses, to increase or maintain our revenue or to avoid a decline in our consolidated net income or a net loss.

Government Regulation

Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerce

industry in many countries where we operate. With the continued state adoption of Internet

7

sales tax laws in 2019, more buyers across the U.S. are encountering sales tax for the first time on the eBay platform. To date, more than 30 states
have implemented Internet sales tax and digital service tax legislation. Tax collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex
sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens for buyers and sellers on our websites and mobile
platforms.

For more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our business is subject to
extensive government regulation and oversight” and “Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-
keeping obligations.”

Seasonality

We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in

“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.”

Technology

eBay Inc.’s platforms use a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others. We
have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer, seller and developer tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help
enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of
large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administration
of large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event
of outages or catastrophic occurrences.

For  information  regarding  technology-related  risks,  see  the  information  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors”  under  the  captions  “Systems  failures  or
cyberattacks  and resulting interruptions  in the availability of or degradation in the performance  of our websites,  applications,  products or services
could harm our business” and “Regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.”

In support of our ongoing commitment to innovation and a better customer experience, we have been on a multi-year evolution to modernize
our marketplace. Through technologies like artificial intelligence, which is woven into all aspects of the eBay marketplace, we are anticipating the
needs  of  buyers,  sellers  and  developers  empowering  entrepreneurs  looking  to  grow  their  business,  and  making  the  platform  more  accessible  to
everyone. We aim to create highly personalized and inspiring shopping experiences powered by advanced technologies.

Intellectual Property

We  regard  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks  (particularly  those  covering  the  eBay  name),  patents,
copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying
on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual
restrictions  to protect  our proprietary  rights in products  and services.  We routinely enter into confidentiality  and invention assignment  agreements
with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of
our proprietary information.

We  pursue  the  registration  of  our  domain  names,  trademarks  and  service  marks  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  Additionally,  we  have  filed
U.S.  and  international  patent  applications  covering  certain  aspects  of  our  proprietary  technology.  Effective  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  domain
name, trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property
rights  and  other  proprietary  rights  in  an  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions,  a  process  that  is  expensive  and  time  consuming  and  may  not  be
successful.

We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place
an active program  to continue to secure trademarks  and domain names that correspond  to our brands in markets  of interest.  If we are unable to
register or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names
are  not  registered  or  protected.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  as
trademarks or copyrighted material, to others.

8

From time to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
We are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item
1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners,
including pirated or counterfeit  items,  may  harm our  business,”  and “We  may be unable to adequately  protect  or enforce  our intellectual  property
rights and face ongoing risk from patent litigation and allegations by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we employed  approximately  13,300 people globally.  Approximately  6,600 of  our  employees  were  located  in the

U.S.

Item 1A: RISK FACTORS

You should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as
well  as  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and  the  other  information  appearing  in  this  report,  for  important  information

Risk Factors That May Affect our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Our operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,

results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.

Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a
result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source
of our revenues or earnings (loss) accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, period-to-period comparisons of our operating
results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have backlog, and substantially
all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues,
it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in
our consolidated financial statements  may be significantly  different  from  historical or projected percentages.  Our operating results  in one or more
future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The trading price of our common stock and debt securities could
decline, perhaps substantially, as a result of the factors described in this paragraph and the other risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section.

Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business.

The businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online
and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants. The Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving
and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services. We compete in two-sided markets, and must attract both buyers
and sellers to use our platforms. Consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants
have more channels to reach consumers. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competing
with  each  other  and  our  competitors  include  a  number  of  online  and  offline  retailers  with  significant  resources,  large  user  communities  and  well-
established  brands.  Moreover,  the  barriers  to  entry  into  these  channels  can  be  low,  and  businesses  easily  can  launch  online  sites  or  mobile
platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommerce
companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or
acquisitions  that  may  be  controversial  with  and  lead  to  dissatisfaction  among  sellers,  which  could  reduce  activity  on  our  platform  and  harm  our
profitability.

We  face  increased  competitive  pressure  online  and  offline.  In  particular,  the  competitive  norm  for,  and  the  expected  level  of  service  from,
ecommerce  and  mobile  commerce  has  significantly  increased  due  to,  among  other  factors,  improved  user  experience,  greater  ease  of  buying
goods,  lower  (or  no)  shipping  costs,  faster  shipping  times  and  more  favorable  return  policies.  In  addition,  certain  platform  businesses,  such  as
Alibaba,  Amazon,  Apple,  Facebook  and  Google,  many  of  whom  are  larger  than  us  or  have  greater  capitalization,  have  a  dominant  and  secure
position in other industries or certain significant markets, and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. If we
are  unable  to  change  our  products,  offerings  and  services  in  ways  that  reflect  the  changing  demands  of  ecommerce  and  mobile  commerce
marketplaces,  particularly  the  higher  growth  of  sales  of  fixed-price  items  and  higher  expected  service  levels  (some  of  which  depend  on  services
provided by sellers on our platforms), or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses, our business will suffer.

Competitors  with  other  revenue  sources  may  also  be  able  to  devote  more  resources  to  marketing  and  promotional  campaigns,  adopt  more
aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Other
competitors may offer or continue to offer faster and/or

10

free  shipping,  delivery  on  Sunday,  same-day  delivery,  favorable  return  policies  or  other  transaction-related  services  which  improve  the  user
experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and more
efficiently, and new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.

Some  of  our  competitors  control  other  products  and  services  that  are  important  to  our  success,  including  credit  card  interchange,  Internet
search, and mobile operating systems. Such competitors could manipulate pricing, availability, terms or operation of service related to their products
and services in a manner that impacts our competitive offerings. For example, Google, which operates a shopping platform service, has from time to
time made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on Google. If we are unable to
use or adapt to operational changes in such services, we may face higher costs for such services, face integration or technological barriers or lose
customers, which could cause our business to suffer.

Consumers who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives, including traditional department, warehouse, boutique,
discount and general merchandise stores (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), online retailers and their related
mobile  offerings,  online  and  offline  classified  services  and  other  shopping  channels,  such  as  offline  and  online  home  shopping  networks.  In  the
United States, these include, but are not limited to, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Etsy, Shopify, Wayfair, Costco, Rakuten,
QVC and HSN, among others. In addition, consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories
of products offered on our site.

Consumers also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from
sellers of all sizes, including social media, online aggregation and classifieds platforms, such as websites operated by Schibsted ASA or Naspers
Limited and others such as craigslist, Oodle.com, Facebook. Consumers also can turn to shopping-comparison sites, such as Google Shopping. In
certain  markets,  our  fixed-price  listing  and  traditional  auction-style  listing  formats  increasingly  are  being  challenged  by  other  formats,  such  as
classifieds.

Our Classifieds platforms offer classifieds listings in a variety of international markets. In many markets in which they operate, our Classifieds

platforms compete for customers and for advertisers against more established online and offline classifieds platforms or other competing websites.

We use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divert
users  to  other  online  shopping  destinations.  Consumers  may  choose  to  search  for  products  and  services  with  a  horizontal  search  engine  or
shopping  comparison  website,  and  such  sites  may  also  send  users  to  other  shopping  destinations.  In  addition,  sellers  are  increasingly  utilizing
multiple sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites,
such as Google, Naver and Baidu.

Consumers  and merchants  who might  use  our  sites  to  sell  goods  also  have  many  alternatives,  including  general  ecommerce  sites,  such  as
Amazon, Alibaba, Zalando and Coupang and more specialized sites, such as Etsy. Our international sites also compete for sellers with general and
specialized  ecommerce  sites.  Sellers  may  also  choose  to  sell  their  goods  through  other  channels,  such  as  classifieds  platforms.  Consumers  and
merchants also can create and sell through their own sites, and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services. In some
countries,  there  are  online  sites  that  have  larger  customer  bases  and  greater  brand  recognition,  as  well  as  competitors  that  may  have  a  better
understanding  of  local  culture  and  commerce.  We  may  increasingly  compete  with  local  competitors  in  developing  countries  that  have  unique
advantages, such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities.

In addition, certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels, such as our sites. Manufacturers
may attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goods
or services. Manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent
distributors from selling on our platforms or on the Internet generally, or drive distributors to sell at prices that would make us less attractive relative
to other alternatives. The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or their use of laws or regulations, in each case discouraging or restricting the sales
of  goods  or  services  over  the  Internet,  could  force  our  users  to  stop  selling  certain  products  on  our  platforms,  which  could  adversely  affect  our
results of operations and result in loss of market share and diminished value of our brands.

11

The principal competitive factors for us include the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

ability to attract, retain and engage buyers and sellers;
volume of transactions and price and selection of goods;
trust in the seller and the transaction;
customer service;
brand recognition;
community cohesion, interaction and size;
website, mobile platform and application ease-of-use and accessibility;
system reliability and security;
reliability of delivery and payment, including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returns;
level of service fees; and
quality of search tools.

We  may  be  unable  to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future  competitors.  Some  current  and  potential  competitors  have  longer

operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and Internet sectors than we do.

Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.

Our  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions.  Economic  conditions,  including  inflation,
recession, or other adverse economic events or changes, could have a negative and adverse impact on companies and customers with which we do
business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerce
platforms. These events and conditions, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s
vote  to  exit  the  European  Union  (known  as  “Brexit”)  and  any  outcomes  resulting  from  that  vote,  could  have  a  negative  and  adverse  impact  on
companies and customers with which we do business or cause us to write down our assets or investments.  Because we have global operations,
including  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  European  Union,  we  face  risks  due  to  the  uncertainty  and  the  potential  disruptions  surrounding  Brexit,
including potential financial, legal, tax and trade implications.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively impact our financial results.

Because we generate the majority of our revenues outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, our financial results
are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or foreign exchange rates. The results of operations of many of our internationally
focused  platforms  are exposed to foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  as the  financial  results  of the applicable subsidiaries  are translated  from  the
local currency into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign
currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollar
strengthens  against  foreign  currencies,  particularly  the  euro,  British  pound,  Korean  won  or  Australian  dollar,  our  translation  of  foreign  currency
denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. In addition to this translation effect, a
strengthening U.S. dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by U.S. sellers to Europe and Australia more than it positively
affects  the  volume  of  goods  being  sold  by  sellers  in  those  geographies  to  buyers  in  the  United  States,  thereby  further  negatively  impacting  our
financial results.

While from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or
eliminate  the  effects  of  this  exposure.  Fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  could  significantly  impact  our  financial  results,  which  may  have  a
significant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities.

Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.

Our international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Korea, and cross-border business from greater China,
have  generated  a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  in  recent  years.  In  addition  to  uncertainty  about  our  ability  to  generate  revenues  from  our  foreign
operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:

uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union and any
outcomes resulting from that vote;
uncertainty regarding how the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union Single Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory and
labor  environments,  especially  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  European  Union,  will  be  impacted  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  the
European Union and any outcomes resulting from that vote, including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients;
expenses  associated  with  localizing  our  products  and  services  and  customer  data,  including  offering  customers  the  ability  to  transact
business  in  the  local  currency  and  adapting  our  products  and  services  to  local  preferences  (e.g.,  payment  methods)  with  which  we  may
have limited or no experience;
trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;
difficulties  in  developing,  staffing,  and  simultaneously  managing  a  large  number  of  varying  foreign  operations  as  a  result  of  distance,
language, and cultural differences;
stringent local labor laws and regulations;
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
profit  repatriation  restrictions,  foreign  currency  exchange  restrictions  or  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  for  a
particular currency;
political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;
geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and terrorism;
import or export regulations;
compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials,
as well as U.S. and foreign laws designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;
antitrust and competition regulations;
potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;
economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;
different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and other laws;
risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;
national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;
payment intermediation regulations;
local licensing and reporting obligations; and
increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.

Violations of the complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions,
or  sanctions  against  us,  our  officers,  or  our  employees;  prohibitions  on  the  conduct  of  our  business;  and  damage  to  our  reputation.  Although  we
have  implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  promote  compliance  with  these  laws,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  employees,
contractors,  or  agents  will  not  violate  our  policies.  These  risks  inherent  in  our  international  operations  and expansion  increase  our  costs  of  doing
business internationally and could harm our business.

Any factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business.

Cross-border  trade  is  an  important  source  of  both  revenue  and  profits  for  us.  Cross-border  trade  also  represents  our  primary  (or  in  some
cases, only) presence in certain important markets, such as Brazil, Latin America, China, and various other countries. In addition, our cross-border
trade is also subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws, such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products,
selective distribution networks, and sellers in other countries listing items on the Internet, and the potential interpretation and application of laws of
multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the buyer, the seller, and/or the location of the item being sold) are often extremely complicated in the
context of cross-border trade. The interpretation and/or application of such laws could impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, purchasing,
selling, shipping, or returning goods across national borders.

The shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty procedures
and  reviews,  including  duty-free  thresholds  in  various  key  markets,  the  interaction  of  national  postal  systems,  and  security  related  governmental
processes  at  international  borders,  may  increase  costs,  discourage  cross-border  purchases,  delay  transit  and  create  shipping  uncertainties.  Any
factors that increase the costs

13

of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm
our business.

Our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, natural disasters, seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users to

spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications, including increased usage of other websites.

Our  users  may  spend  less  time  on  our  websites  and  our  applications  for  mobile  devices  as  a  result  of  a  variety  of  diversions,  including:
geopolitical events, such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity; natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding,
wildfires,  increased  storm  severity,  and  sea  level  rise);  power  shortages  or  outages,  major  public  health  issues,  including  pandemics;  social
networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications; significant local, national or global events capturing the attention of a large part of
the population; and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors. If any of these, or any other factors, divert our users from using our websites or
mobile applications, our business could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends to a large degree on our ability to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devices.

Mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions. A significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms through
mobile devices. We may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users’ mobile and multi-screen experience expectations. The variety of
technical  and  other  configurations  across  different  mobile  devices  and  platforms  increases  the  challenges  associated  with  this  environment.  In
addition,  a  number  of  other  companies  with  significant  resources  and  a  number  of  innovative  startups  have  introduced  products  and  services
focusing on mobile markets.

Our  ability  to  successfully  address  the  challenges  posed  by  the  rapidly  evolving  market  for  mobile  transactions  is  crucial  to  our  continued

success, and any failure to continuously increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our business.

If  we  cannot  keep  pace  with  rapid  technological  developments  or  continue  to  innovate  and  create  new  initiatives  to  provide  new  programs,

products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could decline.

Rapid,  significant  technological  changes  continue  to  confront  the  industries  in  which  we  operate  and  we  cannot  predict  the  effect  of
technological changes on our business. We also continuously strive to create new initiatives and innovations that offer growth opportunities, such as
our new payments and advertising offerings. In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties, including some of our
competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in
which  we  operate  will  continue  to  emerge.  These  new  services  and  technologies  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  we
currently use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and
take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be
inhibited  by  industry-wide  standards,  new  laws  and  regulations,  resistance  to  change  from  our  users,  clients  or  merchants,  or  third  parties’
intellectual  property  rights.  Our  success  will  depend  on  our  ability  to  develop  new  technologies  and  adapt  to  technological  changes  and  evolving
industry standards.

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight.

We  are  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  affecting  our  domestic  and  international  operations  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  consumer
protection, data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, resale of event tickets,
tax,  antitrust  and  anti-competition,  export  requirements,  anti-corruption,  labor,  advertising,  digital  content,  real  estate,  billing,  ecommerce,
promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, environmental, and health and safety regulations, as well
as laws and regulations intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. In addition, we are, or may become, subject to
further  regulation  in some of the above-mentioned  areas or new areas as a result of the continued  development and expansion of  our payments
capabilities.

14

Compliance  with  these  laws,  regulations,  and  similar  requirements  may  be  onerous  and  expensive,  and  variances  and  inconsistencies  from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of
changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive
to our customers, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices.
We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance
that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.

Regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business.

We  are  subject  to  laws  relating  to  the  collection,  use,  retention,  security,  and  transfer  of  personally  identifiable  information  about  our  users
around  the  world.  Much  of  the  personal  information  that  we  collect,  especially  financial  information,  is  regulated  by  multiple  laws.  User  data
protection  laws  may  be  interpreted  and  applied  inconsistently  from  country  to  country.  In  many  cases,  these  laws  apply  not  only  to  third-party
transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial
relations. These laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our business.

Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, user data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. We are subject to a number
of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over
time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide
services  to our customers  that  they  may find  to  be valuable.  For example,  the General Data Protection  Regulation (“GDPR”)  became effective  in
May  2018.  The  GDPR,  which  applies  to  all  of  our  activities  conducted  from  an  establishment  in  the  European  Union  or  related  to  products  and
services  offered  in  the  European  Union,  imposes  a  range  of  new  compliance  obligations  regarding  the  handling  of  personal  data.  The  GDPR
imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If
we fail  to  comply  with  the  GDPR,  or  if  regulators  assert  we  have failed  to  comply  with  the  GDPR,  it  may  lead to  regulatory  enforcement  actions,
which  can  result  in  monetary  penalties  of  up  to  4%  of  worldwide  revenue,  private  lawsuits,  or  reputational  damage.  In  the  U.S.,  California  has
adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which provides a new private right of
action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their
data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. In addition to the CCPA, several
other U.S. states are considering adopting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Compliance with the
GDPR,  the  CCPA,  and  other  current  and  future  applicable  international  and  U.S.  privacy,  cybersecurity  and related  laws  can  be costly  and time-
consuming. Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change
our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant penalties.

A determination  that  there  have been violations  of laws relating  to  our practices  under communications-based  laws could also expose us to
significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In particular, because
of the enormous number of texts, emails and other communications we send to our users, communications laws that provide a specified monetary
damage award or fine for each violation (such as those described below) could result in particularly large awards or fines.

For example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or
TCPA,  in  2012  and  2013  in  a  manner  that  could  increase  our  exposure  to  liability  for  certain  types  of  telephonic  communication  with  customers,
including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500
per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. We are regularly subject to class-action
lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that our businesses violated the TCPA. These lawsuits, and other private lawsuits not
currently alleged as class actions, seek damages (including statutory damages) and injunctive relief, among other remedies. Given the enormous
number  of  communications  we  send  to  our  users,  a  determination  that  there  have  been  violations  of  the  TCPA  or  other  communications-based
statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.

We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived

failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements

15

or  orders  or other  federal,  state  or international  privacy  or consumer  protection-related  laws and regulations,  including the GDPR and the CCPA,
could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  by  governmental  entities  or  others  (e.g.,  class  action  privacy  litigation),  subject  us  to  significant
penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection,
privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If Internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites,
mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the
possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.

Other laws and regulations could harm our business.

It  is  not  always  clear  how  laws  and  regulations  governing  matters  relevant  to  our  business,  such  as  property  ownership,  copyrights,
trademarks,  and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, and obscenity apply to
our  businesses.  Many  of  these  laws  were  adopted  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet,  mobile,  and  related  technologies  and,  as  a  result,  do  not
contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Many of these laws, including some of those that do reference
the Internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws
and  regulations  increases  the  risk  that  we  will  be  subject  to  private  claims  and  governmental  actions  alleging  violations  of  those  laws  and
regulations.

As our activities, the products and services we offer, and our geographical scope continue to expand, regulatory agencies or courts may claim
or  hold  that  we  or  our  users  are  subject  to  additional  requirements  (including  licensure)  or  prohibited  from  conducting  our  business  in  their
jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions. Financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large
companies,  and  regulatory  agencies  may  view  matters  or  interpret  laws  and  regulations  differently  than  they  have  in  the  past  and  in  a  manner
adverse  to  our  businesses.  Our  success  and  increased  visibility  have  driven  some  existing  businesses  that  perceive  us  to  be  a  threat  to  their
businesses  to  raise  concerns  about  our  business  models  to  policymakers  and  regulators.  These  businesses  and  their  trade  association  groups
employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. They may
employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and
the  ability  of  users  to  use  our  products  and  services.  These  established  businesses  have  raised  concerns  relating  to  pricing,  parallel  imports,
professional  seller  obligations,  selective  distribution  networks,  stolen  goods,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  other  intellectual  property  rights  and  the
liability  of  the  provider  of  an  Internet  marketplace  for  the  conduct  of  its  users  related  to  those  and  other  issues.  Any  changes  to  the  legal  or
regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.

Numerous  U.S.  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  the  State  of  California,  have  regulations  regarding  “auctions”  and  the  handling  of
property by “secondhand dealers” or “pawnbrokers.” Several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon
us  or  our  users,  and  others  may  attempt  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Attempted  enforcement  of  these  laws  against  some  of  our  users  appears  to  be
increasing  and  we  could  be  required  to  change  the  way  we  or  our  users  do  business  in  ways  that  increase  costs  or  reduce  revenues,  such  as
forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other penalties,
and any of these outcomes could harm our business.

A number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws. For example,
“trademark exhaustion” principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been
placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder’s consent. The application of “trademark exhaustion” principles is largely unsettled
in the context of the Internet, and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our business
could be harmed.

As  we  expand  and  localize  our  international  activities,  we  are  increasingly  becoming  obligated  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  the  countries  or
markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to
users worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers
or one or more of our users, or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we were
found liable in France, under French law, for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve French buyers or sellers. Laws
regulating  Internet,  mobile  and  ecommerce  technologies  outside  of  the  United  States  are  generally  less  favorable  to  us  than  those  in  the  United
States. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to

16

change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business. In
addition,  we  may  be  subject  to  multiple  overlapping  legal  or  regulatory  regimes  that  impose  conflicting  requirements  on  us  (e.g.,  in  cross-border
trade). Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on
our services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions.

We are regularly subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes, and government inquiries.

We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedings
involving  competition  and  antitrust,  intellectual  property,  privacy,  consumer  protection,  accessibility  claims,  securities,  tax,  labor  and  employment,
commercial disputes, content generated by our users, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have
increased as our company has grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have
increased in complexity.

The  outcome  and  impact  of  such  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.
Regardless  of  the  outcome,  such  investigations  and  proceedings  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on  us  because  of  legal  costs,  diversion  of
management  resources,  and  other  factors.  Determining  reserves  for  our  pending  litigation  and  other  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-intensive
process  that  is  subject  to  judgment  calls.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  require  us  to  make  substantial
payments to satisfy judgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings could
also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring
a change in our business practices in costly ways, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of
these consequences could harm our business.

We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws that could adversely impact our business.

We are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including antitrust and competition
laws.  Some  jurisdictions  also  provide  private  rights  of  action  for  competitors  or  consumers  to  assert  claims  of  anti-competitive  conduct.  Other
companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the
United  States,  individual  states,  the  European  Union  or  other  countries,  or  otherwise  constitute  unfair  competition.  An  increasing  number  of
governments  are  regulating  competition  law  activities,  including  increased  scrutiny  in  large  markets  such  as  China.  Our  business  partnerships  or
agreements  or  arrangements  with  customers  or  other  companies  could  give  rise  to  regulatory  action  or  antitrust  litigation.  Some  regulators,
particularly those outside of the United States, may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices
could be deemed anticompetitive. Certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries. Such claims and investigations,
even if without foundation, may be very expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and
could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices.

Fluctuations in interest rates, and changes in regulatory guidance related to such interest rates, could adversely impact our financial results.

Some of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some of
our fixed rate debt instruments to floating rates. To the extent that prevailing rates increase, our interest expense under these debt instruments will
increase.

Investments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest-earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of
our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities
are subject to greater interest-rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest-rate risk
than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in
market  value  if  interest  rates  increase.  Due  in  part  to  these  factors,  our  investment  income  may  decline  or  we  may  suffer  losses  in  principal  if
securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. In addition, relatively low interest rates limit our investment
income. Fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost

17

of our current or future indebtedness, cause the market value of our assets to decline or reduce our investment income could adversely affect our
financial results.

Our tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks that could harm this business.

Our tickets business, which includes StubHub, is subject to numerous risks, including:

•

•
•

Some  jurisdictions,  in  particular  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States,  prohibit  the  resale  of  event  tickets  (anti-scalping  laws)  at  prices
above the face value of the tickets or at all, or highly regulate the resale of tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws
and regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users’ ability to continue to use, our
tickets business.
Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations.
In many jurisdictions, our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors, which we
must develop and maintain on acceptable terms for our tickets business to be successful.

• Our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events

•

•

and live entertainment industries.
A portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the StubHub platform is processed by StubHub in digital form. Systems failures, security
breaches,  theft  or  other  disruptions  that  result  in  the  loss  of  such  sellers’  tickets  inventory,  could  result  in  significant  costs  and  a  loss  of
consumer confidence in our tickets business.
Lawsuits  alleging  a  variety  of  causes  of  actions  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  be  filed  against  StubHub  and  eBay  by  venue
owners, competitors, ticket buyers, and unsuccessful ticket buyers. Such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to change
our business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business.

• Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies, event organizers,
ticket  brokers,  and online  and  offline  ticket  resellers.  Some  ticketing  service  companies,  event  organizers,  and professional  sports  teams
have  begun  to  issue  event  tickets  through  various  forms  of  electronic  ticketing  systems  that  are  designed  to  restrict  or  prohibit  the
transferability (and by extension, the resale) of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrict
resale  of  season  tickets  to  a  preferred,  designated  website.  Ticketing  service  companies  have  also  begun  to  use  market-based  pricing
strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices, and impose additional restrictions on transferability, for premium tickets.
Some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is not
affiliated with, or approved by, such sports teams.
To the extent that StubHub holds ticket inventory, we may be exposed to losses associated with such inventory.

The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit

items, may harm our business.

The listing or sale by our users of unlawful, counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services, or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner,
has  resulted  and  may  continue  to  result  in  allegations  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  for  unlawful  activities  against  us  (including  the  employees  and
directors of our various entities) involving activities carried out by users through our services. In a number of circumstances, third parties, including
government regulators and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws regarding
the  sale  of  counterfeit  items,  laws  restricting  or  prohibiting  the  transferability  (and  by  extension,  the  resale)  of  digital  goods  (e.g.,  event  tickets,
books, music and software), the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, customs laws, distance selling laws, anti-scalping laws
with respect to the resale of tickets, and the sale of items outside of the United States that are regulated by U.S. export controls.

In addition, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to counterfeit items, have resulted in threatened
and actual litigation from time to time by rights owners, including the following luxury brand owners: Tiffany & Co. in the United States; Rolex S.A.
and  Coty  Prestige  Lancaster  Group  GmbH  in  Germany;  Louis  Vuitton  Malletier  and  Christian  Dior  Couture  in  France;  and  L’Oréal  SA,  Lancôme
Parfums  et  Beauté  &  Cie,  and  Laboratoire  Garnier  &  Cie  in  several  European  countries.  Plaintiffs  in  these  and  similar  suits  seek,  among  other
remedies, injunctive relief and damages. Statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to $150,000 per copyright violation
and $2,000,000 per trademark violation in the United States, and may be even higher in other jurisdictions.  In the past, we have paid substantial
amounts in connection with resolving certain trademark and

18

copyright suits. These and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner that increases costs, lowers revenue, makes
our  websites  and  mobile  platforms  less  convenient  to  customers,  and  requires  us  to  spend  substantial  resources  to  take  additional  protective
measures  or  discontinue  certain  service  offerings  in  order  to  combat  these  practices.  In  addition,  we  have  received  significant  media  attention
relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods, which could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand names, and make
users reluctant to use our products and services.

We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.

Online  services  companies  may  be  subject  to  claims  relating  to  information  disseminated  through  their  services,  including  claims  alleging
defamation, libel, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, among other things. The laws relating to
the liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the United
States and foreign jurisdictions. Any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation
and our business.

Our potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws
governing Internet transactions are unsettled, may increase. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in
any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this
liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which could harm our business.

Changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increase our costs and loss rate.

Our eBay Money Back Guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded,
have not received the item that they purchased or have received an item different from what was described. In addition, as we expand our payments
capabilities,  we  may  be  exposed  to  losses  associated  with  compensating  our  sellers  for  fraudulent  payments.  We  expect  to  continue  to  receive
communications  from  users  requesting  reimbursement  or  threatening  or  commencing  legal  action  against  us  if  no  reimbursement  is  made.  Our
liability for these sorts of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is in
the  United  States.  Litigation  involving  liability  for  any  such  third-party  actions  could  be  costly  and  time  consuming  for  us,  divert  management
attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected
users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.

Development of our payments system requires ongoing investment, is subject to evolving laws, regulations, rules, and standards, and involves

risk, including risks related to our dependence on third-party providers.

We have invested and plan to continue to invest internal resources into our payments tools in order to maintain existing availability, expand into
additional markets and offer new payment methods and tools to our buyers and sellers. If we fail to invest adequate resources into payments on our
platform, or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable, our payments services may not function properly or keep pace with competitive
offerings,  which  could  negatively  impact  their  usage  and  our  marketplaces.  Further,  our  ability  to  expand  our  payments  services  into  additional
countries  is  dependent  upon  the  third-party  providers  we  use  to  support  this  service.  As  we  expand  the  availability  of  our  payments  services  to
additional  markets  or  offer  new  payment  methods  to  our  sellers  and  buyers  in  the  future,  we  may  become  subject  to  additional  regulations  and
compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses.

We rely on third-party service providers to perform services related to compliance, credit card processing, payment disbursements, currency
exchange, identity verification, sanctions screening, and fraud analysis and detection. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to our
dependence  on  third-party  service  providers.  If  any  or  some  of  these  service  providers  fail  to  perform  adequately  or  if  any  such  service  provider
were  to  terminate  or  modify  its  relationship  with  us  unexpectedly,  our  sellers’  ability  to  use  our  platform  to  receive  orders  or  payments  could  be
adversely affected, which would increase costs, drive sellers away from our marketplaces, result in potential legal liability, and harm our business. In
addition, we and our third-party service providers may experience service outages from time to time that could adversely impact payments made on
our  platform.  Additionally,  any  unexpected  termination  or  modification  of  those  third-party  services  could  lead  to  a  lapse  in  the  effectiveness  of
certain fraud prevention and detection tools.

19

Our third-party service providers may increase the fees they charge us in the future, which would increase our operating expenses. This could,
in turn, require us to increase the fees we charge to sellers and cause some sellers to reduce listings on our marketplaces or to leave our platform
altogether by closing their accounts.

Payments  are  governed  by  complex  and  continuously  evolving  laws  and  regulations  that  are  subject  to  change  and  vary  across  different
jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to determine whether various licensing
and registration laws relating to payments apply to us and to comply with applicable laws and licensing and registration regulations. In addition, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or retain any necessary licenses or registrations. Any failure or claim of failure on the part of the
Company  or  its  third-party  service  providers  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  payments  could  require  us  to  expend
significant  resources,  result  in  liabilities,  limit  or  preclude  our  ability  to  enter  certain  markets  and  harm  our  reputation.  In  addition,  changes  in
payment regulations, including changes to the credit or debit card interchange rates in the United States or other markets,  could adversely affect
payments on our platform and make our payments systems less profitable.

Further, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements pursuant to agreements with our
third-party  payment  processors.  These rules  and requirements,  including the Payment Card Industry  Data Security  Standard  and rules  governing
electronic funds transfers, are subject to change or reinterpretation, making it difficult for us to comply. Any failure to comply with these rules and
certification  requirements  could  impact  our  ability  to  meet  our  contractual  obligations  to  our  third-party  payment  processors  and  could  result  in
potential  fines.  In  addition,  changes  in  these  rules  and  requirements,  including  any  change  in  our  designation  by  major  payment  card  providers,
could require a change in our business operations and could result in limitations on or loss of our ability to accept payment cards, any of which could
negatively impact our business. Such changes could also increase our costs of compliance, which could lead to increased fees for us or our sellers
and adversely affect payments on our platform or usage of our payments services and marketplaces.

We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing risks from patent litigation and allegations

by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.

We  believe  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  including  our  trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  domain  names,  trade  dress,  and  trade
secrets,  is  critical  to  our  success.  We  seek  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights  by  relying  on  applicable  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United
States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights
when offering or procuring products and services,  including confidentiality  and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees
and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business.

However, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available,
and  contractual  arrangements  and  other  steps  we  have  taken  to  protect  our  intellectual  property  may  not  prevent  third  parties  from  infringing  or
misappropriating  our  intellectual  property  or  deter  independent  development  of  equivalent  or  superior  intellectual  property  rights  by  others.
Trademark,  copyright,  patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We
must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time
consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of
our  proprietary  rights.  We  have  licensed  in  the  past,  and  expect  to  license  in  the  future,  certain  of  our  proprietary  rights,  such  as  trademarks  or
copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. Any failure
to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or significant costs incurred in doing so, could materially harm our business.

20

Additionally, we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents. We are a defendant in a number of patent suits and
have been notified of several other potential patent disputes. We expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because,
among other reasons:

•
•
•

our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity;
we continue to expand into new businesses, including through acquisitions and licenses; and
the  universe  of  patent  owners  who may  claim  that  we, any  of  the  companies  that  we  have acquired,  or  our  customers  infringe  their
patents, and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners, continues to increase.

As the number of patent owners and products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and as
we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property
rights  of  others  and  we  may  become  increasingly  subject  to  patent  suits  and  other  infringement  claims,  including  copyright,  and  trademark
infringement claims. Such claims may be brought directly against us and/or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are
contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter. We believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and
other  technology  companies  have been,  and continue  to  be, initiated  by  third  parties  whose sole or  primary  business  is  to assert  such  claims.  In
addition, we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries. Patent claims, whether meritorious
or not, are time-consuming and costly to defend and resolve, and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business,
enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings, or cease
conducting certain operations, which would harm our business

The  ultimate  outcome  of  any  allegation  or  litigation  is  uncertain  and,  regardless  of  the  outcome,  any  of  the  claims  described  above,  with  or
without  merit,  may  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  divert  management’s  time  and  attention  from  our  business,  require  us  to  stop
selling, delay roll-out, or redesign our products, or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to pay
substantial  royalty  or  licensing  fees,  or  to  satisfy  indemnification  obligations  that  we  have  with  some  of  our  customers.  Our  failure  to  obtain
necessary license or other rights, or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters, may harm our business.

Failure to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business, and could severely

diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services.

We face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may not
have received the goods that they had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. In some European
and Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period. While
we  can,  in  some  cases,  suspend  the  accounts  of  users  who  fail  to  fulfill  their  payment  or  delivery  obligations  to  other  users,  we do  not  have  the
ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users whole other than through our buyer protection program, which in
the United States we refer to as the eBay Money Back Guarantee, or as we roll out our new payments capabilities, by compensating our sellers for
fraudulent  payments.  Although  we  have  implemented  measures  to  detect  and  reduce  the  occurrence  of  fraudulent  activities,  combat  bad  buyer
experiences and increase buyer satisfaction, including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their
activity,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  these  measures  will  be  effective  in  combating  fraudulent  transactions  or  improving  overall  satisfaction
among  sellers,  buyers,  and  other  participants.  Additional  measures  to  address  fraud  could  negatively  affect  the  attractiveness  of  our  services  to
buyers or sellers, resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users, damage to our reputation, or a diminution in the
value of our brand names.

We  have  substantial  indebtedness,  and  we  may  incur  substantial  additional  indebtedness  in  the  future,  and  we  may  not  generate  sufficient
cash flow from our business to service our indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of our
indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity.

We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under
our  commercial  paper  program  and  revolving  credit  facility  or  through  public  or  private  offerings  of  debt  securities.  Our  outstanding  indebtedness
and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:

21

•

•

•
•

•

requiring  us  to  use  a  significant  portion  of  our  cash  flow  from  operations  and  other  available  cash  to  service  our  indebtedness,  thereby
reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions;
our  indebtedness  and  leverage  may  increase  our  vulnerability  to  downturns  in  our  business,  to  competitive  pressures,  and  to  adverse
changes in general economic and industry conditions;
adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends or other general
corporate and other purposes may be limited; and
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.

These risks increase as the level of our debt increases. Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends
upon  our  future  performance,  which  will  be  subject  to  general  economic  conditions,  industry  cycles  and  financial,  business  and  other  factors
affecting our results of operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow
from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things:

•
•
•
•
•

incur the tax cost of repatriating funds to the United States;
seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;
refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;
sell selected assets; or
reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not

be available on economically favorable terms or at all.

Our revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain, and any debt
instruments we enter into in the future may contain, financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our business and
operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under, or breach any of the covenants in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the right
to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to grace or cure period). Moreover, any such acceleration
and required repayment of or default in respect of any of our indebtedness could, in turn, constitute an event of default under other debt instruments,
thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our
liquidity and financial condition.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.

The credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition
or dispositions and acquisitions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that such
ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a so-called “watch list” for a possible downgrade or
assigned a negative ratings outlook if, in any rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in
our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would
likely increase our borrowing costs, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and could harm our business.

Our business may be subject to sales and other taxes.

The  application  of  indirect  taxes  such  as  sales  and use  tax,  value-added  tax  (“VAT”),  goods  and services  tax  (including  the  “digital  services
tax”),  business  tax  and  gross  receipt  tax  to  ecommerce  businesses  is  a  complex  and  evolving  issue.  Many  of  the  fundamental  statutes  and
regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it is not clear
how  existing  statutes  apply  to  ecommerce  services.  In  addition,  many  state  and  foreign  governments  are  looking  for  ways  to  increase  revenues,
which  has  resulted  in  legislative  action,  including  new  taxes  on  services  and  gross  revenues  and  through  other  indirect  taxes.  There  are  many
transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

22

From time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on our
services. These notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date, but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful in
the future, which would harm our business.

Similar issues exist outside of the United States, where the application of VAT or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex and
evolving.  While  we  attempt  to  comply  in  those  jurisdictions  where  it  is  clear  that  a  tax  is  due,  some  of  our  subsidiaries  have,  from  time  to  time,
received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees. Additionally, we pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the
various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of our
unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or
more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.

In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services. However, tax
authorities may raise questions about our calculation, reporting and collection of these taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes. Should any
new taxes become applicable to our services or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient, our business could be harmed.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there
are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject
to  tax  in  multiple  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions  and  have  structured  our  operations  to  reduce  our  effective  tax  rate.  Our  determination  of  our  tax
liability  is  always  subject  to  audit  and  review  by  applicable  domestic  and  foreign  tax  authorities,  and  we  are  currently  undergoing  a  number  of
investigations, audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our business structure. Any adverse outcome
of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements
and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves
based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.

In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix, by changes in the valuation of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or
accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

In  light  of  continuing  fiscal  challenges  in certain  U.S.  states  and  in  many  countries  in Europe,  various  levels  of  government  are  increasingly
focused  on  tax  reform  and  other  legislative  action  to  increase  tax  revenue,  including  corporate  income  taxes.  A  number  of  U.S.  states  have
attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and
other  direct  business  taxes  on  companies  that  have  no  physical  presence  in  their  state,  and  taxing  authorities  in  foreign  jurisdictions  may  take
similar actions. Many U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their
state from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe, and elsewhere in the world, there are various tax reform efforts underway designed
to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings. Companies that operate over the Internet, such as eBay, are a
target of some of these efforts. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that do not have a physical
presence in their respective jurisdictions, this could increase our effective tax rate.

Our business and its users are subject to Internet sales tax and sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.

The application of sales tax and other indirect taxes on cross border sales by remote sellers is continuing to change and evolve. On June 21,
2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, a case challenging the current law under which online retailers are not
required to collect sales and use tax unless they have a physical presence in the buyer’s state. This decision allows states to adopt new or enforce
existing  laws  requiring  sellers  to  collect  and  remit  sales  and  use  tax,  even  in  states  in  which  the  seller  has  no  presence.  The  adoption  or
enforcement of any such legislation could result in a sales and use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers. This collection responsibility
and the additional costs associated with complex sales and use tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could create additional burdens for
buyers and sellers on our websites and mobile platforms and could harm our business. Moreover, the application of such taxes on our commerce
platforms could cause a marketplace to be less attractive to current and prospective buyers, which could adversely impact our business, financial

23

performance, and growth. The majority of U.S. states have enacted laws or have pending legislation that require marketplace facilitators to collect
and remit sales tax for some or all sellers using these marketplaces.

Similar laws imposing tax collection responsibility on foreign sellers are being considered in other countries as well. We are now jointly liable for
U.K. VAT and German VAT for certain sellers who fail to fulfill their VAT obligations unless we suspend their eBay activity until the seller resolves
the matter with the corresponding VAT authority. Other jurisdictions are considering similar legislation.

Multiple jurisdictions have enacted laws which require marketplaces to report user activity or collect and remit taxes on certain items sold on
the marketplace. For example, we are collecting Australian GST on certain imports into Australia and remitting the GST to the Australian Tax Office.
The European Union has also adopted a VAT reform package which starting in 2021 requires marketplaces such as eBay to collect and remit VAT
on most imports from outside the European Union.

One  or  more  states,  the  U.S.  federal  government  or  foreign  countries  may  seek  to  impose  reporting  or  record-keeping  obligations  on
companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance or if one
of our companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates. Certain of our companies
are  required  to  report  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (the  “IRS”)  and  most  states  on  customers  subject  to  U.S.  income  tax  if  they  reach  certain
payment  thresholds.  As  a  result,  we  are  required  to  request  tax  identification  numbers  from  certain  payees,  track  payments  by  tax  identification
number  and,  under  certain  conditions,  withhold  a  portion  of  payments  and  forward  such  withholding  to  the  IRS.  These  obligations  can  increase
operational costs and change our user experience. Any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and
other sanctions and could harm our business. Imposition of an information reporting requirement could decrease seller or buyer activity on our sites
and would harm our business.

We have periodically received requests from tax authorities for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites,
and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for
all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that are imposed on
us but not on alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from or prosecute sellers or buyers, could
decrease activity on our sites and harm our business.

Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and cyberattacks.

Our  businesses  involve  the  storage  and  transmission  of  users’  personal  financial  information.  In  addition,  a  significant  number  of  our  users
authorize  us  to  bill  their  payment  card  accounts  directly  for  all  transaction  and  other  fees  charged  by  us  or,  in  certain  cases,  third-party  service
providers  utilized  in  our  payment  services.  An  increasing  number  of  websites,  including  those  owned  by  several  other  large  Internet  and  offline
companies,  have disclosed  breaches  of their  security,  some  of which have involved sophisticated  and highly targeted  attacks  on portions  of their
websites  or  infrastructure.  The  techniques  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access,  disable,  or  degrade  service,  or  sabotage  systems,  change
frequently,  may  be  difficult  to  detect  for  a  long  time,  and  often  are  not  recognized  until  launched  against  a  target.  Certain  efforts  may  be  state
sponsored  and  supported  by  significant  financial  and  technological  resources  and  therefore  may  be  even  more  difficult  to  detect.  As  a  result,  we
may  be  unable  to  anticipate  these  techniques  or  to  implement  adequate  preventative  measures.  Unauthorized  parties  may  also  attempt  to  gain
access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving
our  employees,  contractors  and  temporary  staff.  A  party  that  is  able  to  circumvent  our  security  measures,  or  those  of  our  third-party  service
providers, could misappropriate our or our users’ personal information, cause interruption or degradations in our operations, damage our computers
or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation. In addition, our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using
fraudulent  “spoof”  and  “phishing”  emails  to  misappropriate  user  names,  passwords,  payment  card  numbers,  or  other  personal  information  or  to
introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our users’ computers. Our information technology and infrastructure may be
vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users’ proprietary information and payment card data
that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similar
effects.

In  May  2014,  we  publicly  announced  that  criminals  were  able  to  penetrate  and  steal  certain  data,  including  usernames,  encrypted  user

passwords and other non-financial user data. Upon making this announcement, we required

24

all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in order to log into their account. The breach and subsequent password reset have
negatively impacted the business. In July 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the
breach. The lawsuit was dismissed with leave to amend. In addition, we have received requests for information and became subject to investigations
regarding this incident from numerous regulatory and other government agencies across the world.

We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches.
These  issues  are  likely  to  become  more  difficult  and  costly  as  we  expand  the  number  of  markets  where  we  operate.  Additionally,  our  insurance
policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to
fully collect, if at all, under these insurance policies.

Systems  failures  or  cyberattacks  and  resulting  interruptions  in  the  availability  of  or  degradation  in  the  performance  of  our  websites,

applications, products or services could harm our business.

Our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-
service  and  other  cyberattacks,
 disruptions  in
 hurricanes,
telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject to
break-ins,  sabotage  and  intentional  acts  of  vandalism.  Some  of  our  systems  are  not  fully  redundant  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  is  not
sufficient for all eventualities.

 power  losses,

 human  error,

 earthquakes,

 disasters,

 natural

 floods,

 fires,

We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures, denial-of-service attacks and other events or conditions from time
to time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications, including our payments services.
These  events  have  resulted  and  likely  will  result  in  loss  of  revenue.  A  prolonged  interruption  in  the  availability  or  reduction  in  the  speed  or  other
functionality of our websites and mobile applications or payments services could materially harm our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions
in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid
our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages
to  our  customers  or  their  businesses,  these  customers  could  seek  significant  compensation  from  us  for  their  losses  and  those  claims,  even  if
unsuccessful,  would  likely  be  time-consuming  and  costly  for  us  to  address.  We  also  rely  on  facilities,  components  and  services  supplied  by  third
parties and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these
third parties cease to provide the services or facilities. In particular, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility that we
use  could  cause  system  interruptions  and  delays,  result  in  loss  of  critical  data  and  cause  lengthy  interruptions  in  our  services.  We  do  not  carry
business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures
and similar events.

The closing of the proposed sale of StubHub is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in accordance with expected

plans or on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and the pending sale may be disruptive to StubHub.

As previously announced, on November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell StubHub.

The sale is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020. The completion, on our expected timeline, of the proposed sale of StubHub
is subject to closing conditions and viagogo’s ability to obtain debt and equity financing on a timely basis. If the conditions to the closing of the sale
of StubHub are neither satisfied nor, where permissible, waived on a timely basis or at all, we may be unable to complete the sale of StubHub or
such  completion  may  be  delayed  beyond  our  expected  timeline.  We  are  also  subject  to  risks  regarding  the  failure  of  the  buyer  to  obtain  the
necessary financing to complete the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement and risks related to the equity and debt financing
and related guarantee arrangements entered in connection with the stock purchase agreement.

Whether  or  not  the  proposed  sale  of  StubHub  is  completed,  the  announcement  and  pendency  of  the  StubHub  sale  may  be  disruptive  to
StubHub and may adversely affect StubHub’s relationships with current and prospective employees and business partners and buyers and sellers
on its platform. Uncertainties related to the pending sale of

25

StubHub may  impair  StubHub’s  ability  to attract,  retain  and motivate  key personnel  and could divert  the attention  of StubHub’s  management  and
other employees from its day-to-day business and operations in preparation for and during the sale. If we are unable to effectively manage these
risks, StubHub’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be adversely affected.

If the proposed sale of StubHub is delayed or not completed for any reason, including due to the inability to satisfy the closing conditions or due
to the buyer’s inability to obtain the necessary financing or industry or economic conditions outside of our control, investor confidence could decline
and  we  could  face  negative  publicity  and  possible  litigation.  In  addition,  in  the  event  of  a  failed  transaction,  we  will  have  expended  significant
management resources in an effort to complete the sale and, although in some circumstances the buyer may be obligated to pay us a termination
fee of $200 million, will have incurred significant transaction costs. Accordingly, if the proposed sale of StubHub is not completed on the terms set
forth in the stock purchase agreement or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be adversely
affected.

Acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, strategic partnerships and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm

our business or impact our financial results.

We have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope, technologies, services, and products, disposed of significant
businesses (including PayPal and our Enterprise business in 2015), and in November 2019 we have entered into an agreement to sell our StubHub
business to viagogo. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business
strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well
as strategic investments and joint ventures.

These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:

•

•

•
•

•
•

•

•

•
•
•

•
•

•

the  potential  loss  of  key  customers,  merchants,  vendors  and  other  key  business  partners  of  the  companies  we  acquire,  or  dispose  of,
following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plans;
declining  employee  morale  and  retention  issues  affecting  employees  of  companies  that  we  acquire  or  dispose  of,  which  may  result  from
changes in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed
business;
difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;
diversion  of  management  time  and  a  shift  of  focus  from  operating  the  businesses  to  the  transaction,  and  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,
integration and administration;
the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;
the  need  to  integrate  the  operations,  systems  (including  accounting,  management,  information,  human  resource  and  other  administrative
systems), technologies, products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly
process;
the  inefficiencies  and  lack  of  control  that  may  result  if  such  integration  is  delayed  or  not  implemented,  and  unforeseen  difficulties  and
expenditures that may arise as a result;
the  need  to  implement  or  improve  controls,  procedures  and  policies  appropriate  for  a  larger  public  company  at  companies  that  prior  to
acquisition  may  have  lacked  such  controls,  procedures  and  policies  or  whose  controls,  procedures  and  policies  did  not  meet  applicable
legal and other standards;
risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;
derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;
liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction, including intellectual property and other litigation claims
or disputes, violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and, in the
case  of  dispositions,  liabilities  to  the  acquirors  of  those  businesses  under  contractual  provisions  such  as  representations,  warranties  and
indemnities;
the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;
the acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third-party acquiring assets or businesses from us, which in
and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls, policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure; and
our dependence on the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, operating metrics and similar systems, controls and processes
and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems, controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements
or make it more difficult to manage the acquired business.

26

At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of
these  transactions  could  be  material  to  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  it  may  take  us  longer  than  expected  to  fully
realize  the anticipated  benefits  of  these  transactions,  and  those  benefits  may  ultimately  be smaller  than  anticipated  or may  not  be realized  at  all,
which  could  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operating  results.  Any  acquisitions  or  dispositions  may  also  require  us  to  issue  additional  equity
securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-
offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.

We have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and/or lack management and
operational control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with
ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to
our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture. Our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks.
Any circumstances, which may be out of our control, that adversely affect the value of our investments, or cost resulting from regulatory action or
lawsuits in connection with our investments, could harm our business or negatively impact our financial results.

We  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  conjunction  with  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that  entitles  us  to  acquire  a  fixed  number  of
shares of the Adyen’s common stock subject to certain milestones being met. This warrant is accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in Adyen’s common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of this
warrant. We report this warrant on a quarterly basis at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the fair value of this warrant are
recognized in our consolidated statement of income. Fluctuations in Adyen’s common stock or other changes in assumptions could result in material
changes in the fair value that we report in our consolidated balance sheets and our consolidated statement of income, which could have a material
impact on our financial results.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the strategic review of our asset portfolio, as well as the execution of our plan for operating

efficiency.

In  March  2019,  we  announced  that  we  initiated,  with  the  assistance  of  external  financial  advisors,  a  strategic  review  of  our  asset  portfolio,
including  but  not  limited  to  StubHub  and  eBay  Classifieds  Group.  In  November  2019, as  an  outcome  of  our  strategic  review,  we  entered  into  an
agreement to sell our StubHub business to viagogo. Our strategic  review efforts  continue, however, there can be no assurance that the strategic
review  will  result  in  any  further  sale,  spin-off  or  other  business  combination  involving  our  assets.  We  will  incur  expenses  in  connection  with  the
review and our future results may be affected by the pursuit or consummation of any specific transaction or other strategic alternative resulting from
the strategic review. While this review is ongoing, we are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties, including retaining and attracting employees
during  the  review  process;  the  diversion  of  management’s  time  to  the  review;  and  exposure  to  potential  litigation  in  connection  with  the  review
process or any specific transaction  or other strategic  alternative  resulting therefrom,  all of which could disrupt and negatively affect  our business.
Speculation  regarding  any  developments  related  to  the  review  of  strategic  alternatives  and  perceived  uncertainties  related  to  the  future  of  the
Company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly. There is no finite timetable for completion of the strategic review, and we can provide
no  assurance  that  any  transaction  or  other  strategic  alternative  we  pursue  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  our  results  of  operations  or  financial
condition.

In addition, we announced that our operating review has resulted in a three-year plan for operating efficiency, which is expected to enhance our

operating margins and create capacity for reinvestment initiatives. The execution of this plan is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the anticipated results of this plan.

Our success largely depends on key personnel. Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain,
and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business. The loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our
business.

Our  future  performance  depends  substantially  on  the  continued  services  of  our  senior  management  and  other  key  personnel,  including  key
engineering  and  product  development  personnel,  and  our  ability  to  attract,  retain,  and  motivate  key  personnel.  Competition  for  key  personnel  is
intense, especially in the Silicon Valley where our corporate

27

headquarters  are  located,  and  we  may  be  unable  to  successfully  attract,  integrate  or  retain  sufficiently  qualified  key  personnel.  In  making
employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they
would  receive  in  connection  with  their  employment  and  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  may  make  it  more  difficult  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate
employees. In addition, we do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life
insurance policies. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior
management and other key personnel, could harm our business.

On September 25, 2019, we announced the appointment of an interim Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors is actively undertaking a

search for our next Chief Executive Officer. This search and any eventual transition to a Chief Executive Officer may result in disruptions to our
business and uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any such disruptions and
uncertainty, as well as a delay or failure in successfully identifying, attracting or retaining a permanent Chief Executive Officer, could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our sellers could harm our business.

A  number  of  third  parties  provide  services  to  us  or  to  our  sellers.  Such  services  include  seller  tools  that  automate  and  manage  listings,
merchant  tools  that  manage  listings  and  interface  with  inventory  management  software,  storefronts  that  help  our  sellers  list  items  and  shipping
providers  that  deliver  goods  sold  on  our  platform,  among  others.  Financial  or  regulatory  issues,  labor  issues  (e.g.,  strikes,  lockouts,  or  work
stoppages), or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers could harm our business.

Price increases by, or service terminations,  disruptions  or interruptions  at, companies that provide services  to us and our sellers and clients
could  also  reduce  the  number  of  listings  on  our  platforms  or  make  it  more  difficult  for  our  sellers  to  complete  transactions,  thereby  harming  our
business. Some third parties who provide services to us or our sellers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us
without competitive constraint. While we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their
shipping experience,  postal rate increases  may reduce the competitiveness  of certain sellers’ offerings,  and postal service changes could require
certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient, which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our
sites, thereby harming our business.

We have outsourced certain functions to third-party providers, including some customer support and product development functions, which are
critical  to  our  operations.  If  our  service  providers  do  not  perform  satisfactorily,  our  operations  could  be  disrupted,  which  could  result  in  user
dissatisfaction and could harm our business.

There can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at
all.  If  any  third  parties  were  to  stop  providing  services  to  us  or  our  sellers  on  acceptable  terms,  including  as  a  result  of  bankruptcy,  we  may  be
unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.

Our developer platforms, which are open to merchants and third-party developers, subject us to additional risks.

We provide third-party developers with access to application programming interfaces, software development kits and other tools designed to
allow them to produce applications for use, with a particular focus on mobile applications. There can be no assurance that merchants or third-party
developers  will  develop  and  maintain  applications  and  services  on  our  open  platforms  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  and  a  number  of  factors  could
cause  such  third-party  developers  to  curtail  or  stop  development  for  our  platforms.  In  addition,  our  business  is  subject  to  many  regulatory
restrictions.  It  is  possible  that  merchants  and  third-party  developers  who  utilize  our  development  platforms  or  tools  could  violate  these  regulatory
restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations, which could harm our business.

We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.

In  January  2019,  we  initiated  a  quarterly  cash  dividend  on  our  common  stock.  The  timing,  declaration,  amount  and  payment  of  any  future
dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, working capital, financial
condition, results of operations, capital requirements, covenants in our debt instruments, applicable law and other considerations that our Board of
Directors considers relevant. A

28

reduction  in  the  amount  of  cash  dividends  on  our  common  stock,  the  suspension  of  those  dividends  or  a  failure  to  meet  market  expectations
regarding  potential  dividend  increases  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock.  If  we  do  not  pay  cash
dividends on our common stock in the future, realization of a gain on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely on the appreciation of
the price of our common stock, which may not occur.

We could incur significant liability if the Distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.

We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that our distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to
our  stockholders  on  July  17,  2015  (the  “Distribution”)  qualifies  as  a  transaction  that  is  described  in  Sections  355  and  368(a)(1)(D)  of  the  Internal
Revenue  Code.  The  opinion  relies  on  certain  facts,  assumptions,  representations  and  undertakings  from  PayPal  and  us  regarding  the  past  and
future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are
incorrect  or  not  satisfied,  our  stockholders  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  rely  on  the  opinion  of  tax  counsel  and  could  be  subject  to  significant  tax
liabilities.  Notwithstanding  the  opinion  of  tax  counsel  we  have  received,  the  IRS  could  determine  on  audit  that  the  Distribution  is  taxable  if  it
determines  that  any  of  these  facts,  assumptions,  representations  or  undertakings  are  not  correct  or  have  been violated  or  if  it  disagrees  with  the
conclusions in the opinion. If the Distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to
U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

We may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the Distribution.

We  entered  into  a  separation  and  distribution  agreement  and  various  other  agreements  with  PayPal  to  govern  the  Distribution  and  the
relationship of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us
and  PayPal.  The  indemnity  rights  we  have  against  PayPal  under  the  agreements  may  not  be  sufficient  to  protect  us.  In  addition,  our  indemnity
obligations to PayPal may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

We  own  and  lease  various  properties  in  the  U.S.  and  31  other  countries  around  the  world.  We  use  the  properties  for  executive  and
administrative offices, data centers, product development offices, fulfillment centers and customer service offices. Our headquarters are located in
San Jose, California and occupies approximately 0.5 million square feet. Our owned data centers are solely located in Utah. As of December 31,
2019, our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage as follows (in millions):

From time to time we consider various alternatives related to our long-term facilities needs. While we believe that our existing facilities, which
are used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate to meet our immediate needs, it may become necessary to develop and improve land that
we own or lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Overview

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in
our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the
low  end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses
arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable  or  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  losses  arising  from  a  proceeding,  we  have  disclosed  that  fact.  In  assessing  the  materiality  of  a
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies
sought  by  plaintiffs  (e.g.,  injunctive  relief)  that  may  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  that  could  have  a  material  adverse
impact  on our  business.  With  respect  to the  matters  disclosed  in  this  Item  3,  we are  unable to  estimate  the possible  loss  or range  of losses  that
could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.

Amounts  accrued  for  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  for  which  we  believe  a  loss  is  probable  were  not  material  for  the  year  ended
December  31,  2019.  Except  as  otherwise  noted  for  the  proceedings  described  in  this  Item  3,  we  have  concluded,  based  on  currently  available
information,  that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or
settlement)  in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and
subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations,  the  impact  on  our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  material.  Legal  fees  are  expensed  as
incurred.

General Matters

Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We
are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business
as  our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/or
against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure
to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past been
forced to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the
Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the
range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations) and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws
with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits
alleging that we have violated patent, copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us. Intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are
time consuming and costly to defend and resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter
into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms.

From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our
users (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,
rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,
prices,  rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  and
regulatory landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and
services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatory
actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for
certain  causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,
require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant
operational resources or otherwise harm our business.

31

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,
which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our
indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that
such  marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  for
intellectual  property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.

To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant,

either individually or collectively.

PART II

SECURITIES

Common Stock

Our  common  stock  has  been  traded  on  The  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  under  the  symbol  “EBAY”  since  September  24,  1998.  As  of
January 27, 2020, there were approximately 3,524 holders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are a significantly larger
number of beneficial owners of our common stock.

Dividend Policy

During 2019, the company paid a total of $473 million in cash dividends. In January 2020, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per
share of common stock to be paid on March 20, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 2, 2020. The timing, declaration, amount and payment
of any future cash dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, working
capital,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  capital  requirements,  covenants  in  our  credit  agreement,  applicable  law  and  other  business
considerations  that  our  Board  of  Directors  considers  relevant.  See  “We  cannot  provide  assurance  that  we  will  continue  to  pay  dividends  on  our
common stock” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Performance Measurement Comparison

The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return of an investment of $100 (and the reinvestment of any dividends thereafter) on
December 31, 2014 (the last trading day for the year ended December 31, 2014) in (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite Index, (iii) the
S&P  500  Index  and  (iv)  the  S&P  500  Information  Technology  Index.  For  the  purpose  of  this  graph,  the  distribution  of  100%  of  the  outstanding
common stock of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) to our stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became an independent company, is treated as a
non-taxable  cash  dividend  of  $41.46,  an  amount  equal  to  the  opening  price  of  PayPal  common  stock  on  July  20,  2015  which  was  deemed
reinvested in eBay common stock at the opening price on July 20, 2015.

Our stock price performance shown in the graph below is not indicative of future stock price performance. The graph and related information
shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or be deemed to be “filed” with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
past or future filing with the SEC, except to the extent that such filing specifically states that such graph and related information are incorporated by

In  January  2018  our  Board  authorized  a  $6.0  billion  stock  repurchase  program  and  in  January  2019  our  Board  authorized  an  additional  $4.0 billion stock repurchase
program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.

Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our
stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  made  through  open  market  transactions,  block  trades,  privately  negotiated  transactions  (including  accelerated  share  repurchase
transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.

During  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2019,  we  repurchased  approximately  $1.0  billion of  our  common  stock  under  our  stock  repurchase  program.  As  of
December 31, 2019, a total of approximately  $2.2 billion remained  available  for  future  repurchases  of  our common  stock  under  our  stock  repurchase  program.  During
January 2020, our Board authorized an additional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.

We expect,  subject to  market conditions and  other uncertainties, to  continue  making opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of  our common stock.  However, our
stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of
factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to
future business, future results of operations or financial condition, new or planned features or services, management strategies or timing and other
expectations regarding our sale of StubHub to viagogo). You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as “may,” “will,” “would,”
“should,”  “could,”  “expect,”  “anticipate,”  “believe,”  “estimate,”  “intend,”  “plan”  and  other  similar  expressions.  These  forward-looking  statements
involve  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  cause  our  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  or  implied  in  our  forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as
well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the
date of this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  You should read the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report.

OVERVIEW

Business

eBay Inc., a global commerce leader, includes Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, eBay connects millions of buyers
and  sellers  around  the  world,  empowering  people  and  creating  opportunity  for  all.  Founded  in  1995  in  San  Jose,  California,  eBay  is  one  of  the
world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our technologies and services are designed to give
buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and
anywhere. In 2019, eBay enabled over $90 billion of Gross Merchandise Volume.

Presentation

In addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management uses non-GAAP measures
in reviewing our financial results. The foreign exchange neutral (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed below are non-
GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX-
Neutral  information  appearing  in  the  following  discussion  of  our  results  of  operations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  information  provided
below  in  “Non-GAAP  Measures  of  Financial  Performance,”  which  includes  reconciliations  of  FX-Neutral  financial  measures  to  the  most  directly
comparable  GAAP  measures.  We  calculate  the  year-over-year  impact  of  foreign  currency  movements  using  prior  period  foreign  currency  rates
applied to current year transactional currency amounts.

Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, British
pound, Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may impact our financial results. Because of this and the fact
that  we  generate  a  majority  of  our  net  revenues  internationally,  including  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019, 2018 and  2017,  we  are
subject to the risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Item 1A: Risk Factors.”

The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2019 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against

the euro, British pound and Korean won.

Fiscal Year Highlights

Net  revenues  increased  1% to  $10.8  billion in  2019 compared  to  2018,  primarily  driven  by  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  and
Classifieds marketing services and other revenues. FX-Neutral net revenue (as defined above) increased 2% in 2019 compared to 2018. Operating
margin increased to 21.5% in 2019 compared to 20.7% in 2018.

37

We generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2019 compared to $2.7 billion in 2018, ending the year with cash,

cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $3.8 billion.

In the first quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of the U.K. based classifieds site, Motors.co.uk for $93 million in cash. During the
third quarter of 2019, $400 million of floating rate notes and $1.15 billion of 2.200% fixed rate notes matured and were repaid. During the year ended
December 31, 2019 we paid $473 million in cash dividends.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell StubHub to viagogo for a purchase price of $4.05 billion in cash.

The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and closing conditions.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.10 in 2019 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.55 in 2018. In January
2020,  we  declared  a  quarterly  cash  dividend  of  $0.16  per  share  of  common  stock  to  be  paid  on  March  20,  2020  to  stockholders  of  record  as  of
March 2, 2020.

Net revenues included $81 million of hedging gains and  $8 million and $28 million of hedging losses during the years ended December 31,

2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The hedging activity in net revenues specifically relates to hedges of net transaction revenues generated by our
Marketplace segment. Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of $211 million, a favorable impact of $174
million and unfavorable impact of $39 million on net revenues for the years December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effect of foreign
currency exchange rate movements in 2019 compared to  2018 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro,
British pound and Korean won. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound and Korean won.

39

Net Revenues by Type and Segment

We generate two types of net revenues:

Net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers
on our Marketplace platforms and final value fees from sellers and buyers on our StubHub platforms. Our net transaction revenues also
include  store  subscription  and  other  fees  often  from  large  enterprise  sellers.  Our  net  transaction  revenues  are  reduced  by  incentives,
including discounts, coupons and rewards, provided to our customers.

Marketing services and other ("MS&O") revenues consist of Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds revenues principally from the sale
of advertisements, classifieds fees, revenue sharing arrangements and first-party inventory programs.

Net Transaction Revenues

Key Operating Metrics

Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) and take rate are significant factors that we believe affect our net transaction revenues.

GMV consists of the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace or StubHub platforms during the
applicable  period,  regardless  of  whether  the  buyer  and  seller  actually  consummated  the  transaction.  Despite  GMV’s  divergence  from
revenue during 2019, we still believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through
our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated.

Take rate is defined as net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

(1) Marketplace  net transaction  revenues were net of  $81 million, $8 million and  $28 million hedging  activity  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019, 2018 and  2017

respectively.

Marketplace net transaction revenues increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees and a higher take
rate. Marketplace transaction take rate was higher in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final
value fees are calculated as a percentage of an item’s sale price, and category mix. The increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2019
compared  to  2018  was  due  to  take  rate  considerations  discussed  above,  despite  declining  Marketplace  GMV.  We  expect  that  the  divergence
between  Marketplace  net  transaction  revenues  and  Marketplace  GMV  will  continue.  Despite  GMV’s  divergence  from  net  transaction  revenues
during the year,  we still  believe the  metric  provides  a useful  measure  of overall  volume  of closed transactions  that  flow through  the platform  in a
given period.

The increase in Marketplace net transaction revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in Marketplace GMV and a
favorable  impact  from  foreign  currency  movements  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar.  Marketplace  transaction  take  rate  was  higher  in  2018 compared  to
2017, primarily due to growth in promoted listing fees, which along with final value fees are calculated as a percentage of an items sale price, and a
decrease in seller incentives, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from final value fees attributable to pricing and category mix.

StubHub net transaction  revenues  in 2019 compared  to 2018 decreased  slightly  primarily  driven  by  lower  GMV  from  concerts  and  theater,
partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  sporting  events  and  a  slightly  higher  take  rate.  The  slight  increase  in  StubHub  transaction  take  rate  in  2019
compared to 2018 was primarily due to pricing changes partially offset by event mix.

The increase in StubHub net transaction revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in StubHub GMV. The increase
in StubHub GMV in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by concerts and sporting events. The increase in StubHub transaction take rate in
2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to pricing changes on the platform.

Marketplace MS&O Revenues

The decrease in Marketplace MS&O revenues during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenues that
was driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are recognized in net transaction revenues and lower revenues resulting from the
sale of brands4friends. These decreases were partially offset by increases in first-party inventory program in Korea in 2019 compared to 2018.

The increase in Marketplace MS&O revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in revenues attributable to our
first-party inventory program in Korea and revenue sharing arrangements, particularly shipping, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenues
that was driven by our ongoing shift to promoted listing fees, which are recognized in net transaction revenues.

Classifieds MS&O Revenues

The increases in Classifieds MS&O  revenues  in 2019 compared  to 2018 and in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily  driven by increased

revenue from our Classifieds horizontal and vertical motors platforms primarily in Germany.

StubHub MS&O Revenues

The increase in StubHub MS&O revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to growth in revenues from first-party inventory sales

from sporting events. The change in StubHub MS&O revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was relatively flat.

Cost of Net Revenues

Cost  of  net  revenues  primarily  consists  of  costs  associated  with  customer  support,  site  operations,  costs  of  goods  sold  and  payment
processing. Significant components of these costs include employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment and
amortization  expense,  first  party  inventory  costs,  bank  transaction  fees,  and  credit  card  interchange  and  assessment  fees.  The  following  table
presents cost of net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

The increase in cost of net revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in site operation
and payment  processing costs as we increased our investments  in our business, and an increase in costs of goods sold driven by our first-party
inventory program in Korea.

Cost of net revenues, net of immaterial hedging activities, was favorably impacted by $56 million attributable to foreign currency movements
relative to the U.S. dollar in 2019 compared to 2018. Cost of net revenues was unfavorably impacted by $34 million attributable to foreign currency
movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2018. There was no hedging activity within cost of net revenues in 2018.

Foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of $118 million on operating expenses in 2019 compared to
2018. Operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by $68 million attributable to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2018
compared to 2017. There was no hedging activity within operating expenses in 2019 and 2018.

43

Sales and Marketing

Sales  and  marketing  expenses  primarily  consist  of  advertising  and  marketing  program  costs  (both  online  and  offline),  employee
compensation,  certain  user  coupons  and  rewards,  contractor  costs,  facilities  costs  and  depreciation  on  equipment.  Online  marketing  expenses
represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline advertising primarily
includes brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.

The  decrease  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  a  favorable  impact  from  foreign  currency
movements relative to the U.S. dollar and decreases in offline advertising spend and employee-related costs. These costs were partially offset by
online marketing spend and user coupons and rewards largely driven by our Japan platform acquired in the second quarter of 2018.

The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in user coupons and rewards and

traffic acquisition costs.

Product Development

Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment.
Product  development  expenses  are  net  of  required  capitalization  of  major  platform  and  other  product  development  efforts,  including  the
development and maintenance of our technology platform. Our top technology priorities include payment intermediation capabilities and improved
seller tools and buyer experiences built on a foundation of structured data.

Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $137 million and $147 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are primarily

reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.

The decrease in product development expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreases in employee-related costs, foreign
currency movement relative to the U.S. dollar and depreciation on equipment. The increase in product development expenses in 2018 compared to
2017 was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on equipment.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment,
employer  payroll  taxes  on  stock-based  compensation,  legal  expenses,  restructuring,  insurance  premiums  and  professional  fees.  Our  legal
expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to severance costs incurred in 2019 related

to our CEO transition.

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to restructuring costs related to our global
workforce reduction and an increase in employee-related costs. For additional details related to the restructuring, refer to “Note 18 – Restructuring”
to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Provision for Transaction Losses

Provision for transaction losses primarily consists of transaction loss expense associated with our buyer protection programs, fraud and bad
debt  expense  associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  We  expect  our  provision  for  transaction  losses  to  fluctuate  depending  on  many
factors, including changes to our protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.

The  increase  in  provision  for  transaction  losses  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  bad  debt  expense.  The

increase in provision for transaction losses in 2018 compared to 2017 was not significant.

The increase in income from operations in 2019 compared 2018 was primarily due to an increase in income from our Marketplace segment.
Income  from  our  StubHub  and  Classifieds  segments  was  not  a  significant  contributor  to  the  increase  in  total  income  from  operations  in  2019
compared  to  2018.  The  decrease  in  income  from  operations  in  2018  compared  to  2017  was  primarily  due  to  global  workforce  reduction  and  an
increase in employee related costs, partially offset by an increase in income from our Marketplace and Classifieds segments.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest  and  other,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  earned  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  investments,  as  well  as  foreign  exchange
transaction gains and losses, gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrant received from Adyen, our portion of operating results from
investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of  accounting,  investment  gain/loss  on  acquisitions  or  disposals  and  interest  expense,
consisting  of  interest  charges  on  any  amounts  borrowed  and  commitment  fees  on  unborrowed  amounts  under  our  credit  agreement  and  interest
expense on our outstanding debt securities  and commercial  paper, if any. The following table presents interest  and other, net (in millions, except

The decrease in interest and other, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of our
investment in Flipkart of $313 million and the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in Giosis of $266 million that did not occur in
2019, the loss recorded upon the divestiture of brands4friends of $52 million partially offset by the gain recognized due to the change in fair value of
the Adyen warrant of $133 million that occurred in 2019.

The increase in interest and other, net in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the $313 million gain recognized on the sale of
our investment in Flipkart and $266 million gain recognized upon relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in Giosis and $104 million
gain recognized due to the change in fair value of the warrant.

The  increase  in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  primarily  due  to  a  reduction  in  2018  to  the  provisional  tax  amounts
recorded in 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in
Giosis  that  was  not  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  on  a  current  basis  that  did  not  recur  in  2019,  and  certain  expenses  in  2019  including  a
negotiated reduction in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our Classifieds platforms. These impacts were partially offset in 2019 by the effective
settlements of audits, reduction in the U.S. deferred tax liability for minimum tax on foreign earnings, related to the above reduction in tax basis of
intangible assets, and a benefit due to the enacted New York state legislation regarding the taxability of foreign earnings.

The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $3.1 billion provisional tax charge related to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act” or “U.S. tax reform”) recorded in 2017. In 2018, as we completed our analysis of U.S. tax reform, we recorded a $463
million reduction to the provisional tax amounts recorded in 2017. Further, the 2018 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by U.S. tax reform and
the gain recognized from the relinquishment of our existing equity method investment in Giosis in the second quarter 2018 that is not subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a current basis.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal income tax
rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation
of  unremitted  foreign  earnings  in  2017  and  created  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  recognized  a  provisional
income tax charge of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidated
statement  of  income.  We  completed  our  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  U.S.  tax  reform  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018  and  recognized  a  $463  million
reduction  to  the  provisional  tax  amounts  recorded  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017,  which  is  included  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  from
continuing operations in 2018.

Included  in the 2017 provisional  amount  was $1.4  billion for the  income tax  on the deemed repatriation  of unremitted  foreign earnings.  We
completed the computation of this amount as part of the 2017 income tax return filing and reduced the provisional amount by $18 million and we
utilized $213 million of foreign tax credits to reduce the net liability, both in 2018.

The  remaining  provisional  amount  of  $1.7  billion  was  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.
minimum tax on foreign earnings, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreign
earnings. We completed our analysis of the components of the deferred tax computation in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a tax benefit of
$445 million  as  a reduction  to  the  provisional  amounts  recorded  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2017 for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act.  This
amount  includes  a  $389  million  tax  benefit  as  a  result  of  clarification  by  Swiss  tax  authorities  regarding  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  to
repatriated earnings in October 2018.

As a result of U.S. tax reform, our earnings in foreign jurisdictions are taxed at substantially the same rate as the U.S. federal statutory tax
rate of 21%. In 2017, our provision for income taxes differed from the provision computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily
due to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The impact on our provision for income
taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates that the U.S. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $217 million in 2017. The
foreign  jurisdictions  with  lower  tax  rates  that  had  the  most  significant  impact  on  our  provision  for  income  taxes  in  2017  include  Switzerland.  See
“Note 15 - Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.

46

From  time  to  time  we  engage  in  certain  intercompany  transactions.  We  consider  many  factors  when  evaluating  these  transactions.  These
transactions may impact our tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. The impact in any period may be significant. These transactions
are complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.

We  are  regularly  under  examination  by  tax  authorities  both  domestically  and  internationally.  We  believe that  adequate  amounts  have  been
reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the
inherent uncertainties in these examinations. Due to the ongoing tax examinations, it is generally impractical to determine the amount and timing of
these  adjustments.  However,  we  expect  several  tax  examinations  to  close  within  the  next  twelve  months.  See  “Note  15  –  Income  Taxes”  to  the
consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on estimated settlements within the next twelve months.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance

To  supplement  our  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  we  use  FX-
Neutral  net  revenues,  which  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Management  uses  the  foregoing  non-GAAP  measures  in  reviewing  our  financial
results. We define FX-Neutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect. We define exchange rate effect as the year-over-year
impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts, excluding
hedging activity.

These  non-GAAP  measures  are  not  in  accordance  with,  or  an  alternative  to,  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and  may  be
different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of
accounting  rules  or  principles.  Non-GAAP  measures  have  limitations  in  that  they  do  not  reflect  all  of  the  amounts  associated  with  our  results  of
operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with
the corresponding GAAP measures.

These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects
for the future.  Specifically,  we believe these non-GAAP measures  provide useful information  to both management  and investors  by excluding the
foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because we have
historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, we believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provide consistency in our
financial reporting.

Cash provided by continuing operating activities of $3.1 billion in 2019 was primarily attributable to net income of $1.8 billion with adjustments
of $681 million in depreciation and amortization,  $505 million in stock-based  compensation,  $300 million in provision for transaction  losses,  $117
million for deferred income taxes, $52 million loss on the sale of a business, partially offset by a decrease of $200 million in changes in assets and
liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and $133 million for changes in the fair value of the Adyen warrant.

Cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.7 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to net income of $2.5 billion with adjustments
of  $696  million  in  depreciation  and  amortization,  $538  million  in  stock-based  compensation  and  $286  million  in  provision  for  transaction  losses,
partially offset by a decrease of $577 million in changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition effects, and adjustments of $572 million for gain
on investments, $153 million for deferred income taxes and $104 million for changes in fair value of the Adyen warrant.

The  net  cash  provided  by  continuing  operating  activities  of  $3.1  billion  in  2017  was  primarily  due  to  $1.1  billion  of  changes  in  assets  and
liabilities,  net  of  acquisition  effects,  and  a  net  loss  of  $1.0  billion  offset  by  adjustments  of  $1.7  billion  in  deferred  income  taxes,  $676  million  in
depreciation and amortization and $483 million in stock-based compensation.

Cash paid for income taxes in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $333 million, $597 million and $308 million, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes
in 2018 included tax payments related to our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings under U.S. tax reform of $168 million, including a
prepayment of $72 million.

Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities of $2.8 billion in 2019 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $50.5 billion from the maturities and sales
of investments, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of investments of $47.0 billion, property and equipment of $554 million, equity investment
in Paytm Mall of $160 million and acquisitions of $93 million.

Cash provided by investing activities of $2.9 billion in 2018 was primarily attributable to proceeds of $30.9 billion from the maturities and sales
of  investments  and  $1.0  billion  from  the  sale  of  equity  investment  in  Flipkart,  partially  offset  by  cash  paid  for  purchases  of  investments  of  $28.1
billion, property and equipment of $651 million and acquisitions of $302 million.

The net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2017 was primarily due to cash paid for property and equipment of $666 million and

cash paid for our equity investment in Flipkart of $514 million.

The  largely  offsetting  effects  of  purchases  of  investments  and  maturities  and  sale  of  investments  results  from  the  management  of  our

investments. As our immediate cash needs change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.

49

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities of $7.1 billion in 2019 was primarily used to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock, repay outstanding debt

of $1.6 billion and pay $473 million of cash dividends.

Cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion in 2018 was primarily used to repurchase $4.5 billion of common stock and repay $750 million

of our outstanding senior notes.

The net cash used in financing activities of $1.8 billion in 2017 was primarily due to $2.7 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock and

$1.5 billion of cash used to repay outstanding debt, partially offset by $2.5 billion of cash proceeds from debt issuances.

The  negative  effect  of  exchange  rate  movements  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  restricted  cash  was  due  to  the  strengthening  of  the  U.S.
dollar against other currencies, primarily the Korean won, euro and British pound during 2019. The negative effect of exchange rate movements on
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro, Korean won
and  British  pound,  during  2018.  The  positive  effect  of  exchange  rate  movements  on  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  restricted  cash  was  due  to  the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the euro and Korean won, during 2017.

Stock Repurchases

In January 2018, our Board authorized a $6.0 billion stock repurchase program and in January 2019, our Board authorized an additional $4.0
billion  stock  repurchase  program.  These  stock  repurchase  programs  have  no  expiration  from  the  date  of  authorization.  Our  stock  repurchase
programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions
and  other  factors,  to  make  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  our  common  stock  to  reduce  our  outstanding  share  count.  Any  share
repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions
(including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be
funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.

During 2019,  we  repurchased  approximately  $5.0 billion of  our  common  stock  under  our  stock  repurchase  programs.  As  of  December 31,
2019, a total of approximately $2.2 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. In
January 2020, our Board authorized an additional $5.0 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization.

We  expect,  subject  to  market  conditions  and  other  uncertainties,  to  continue  making  opportunistic  and  programmatic  repurchases  of  our
common  stock.  However,  our  stock  repurchase  programs  may  be  limited  or  terminated  at  any  time  without  prior  notice.  The  timing  and  actual
number  of  shares  repurchased  will  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors,  including  corporate  and  regulatory  requirements,  price  and  other  market
conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

Dividends

The company paid a total of $473 million in cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2019. No cash dividends were paid in 2018

and 2017. In January 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock to be paid on March 20, 2020 to stockholders of
record as of March 2, 2020.

Shelf Registration Statement and Debt

As of December 31, 2019, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows
us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in
shares  of  preferred  stock,  purchase  contracts  and  units  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  offerings.  Each  issuance  under  the  shelf  registration
statement  will  require  the  filing  of  a  prospectus  supplement  identifying  the  amount  and  terms  of  the  securities  to  be  issued.  The  registration
statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and
other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.

50

Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2019, we had floating- and fixed-rate senior notes outstanding for an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion. The net
proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes are used for general corporate  purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures,
share repurchases, repayment of indebtedness and possible acquisitions. The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after
March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all
of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price plus
accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixed
rate notes due 2022, the floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000%
fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain  exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. For additional details related to our senior notes, please see “Note 10 – Debt” to the
consolidated financial statements included in this report.

To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered
into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the London InterBank
Offered  Rate  (“LIBOR”)  plus  a  spread.  These  swaps  were  designated  as  fair  value  hedges  against  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  certain  fixed  rate
senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as $1.15 billion related to
our  2.200%  senior  notes  of  the  $2.4  billion  aggregate  notional  amount  matured.  In  addition,  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  we
terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due
July 2024. As a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as an
increase to the long-term debt balance and is being recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. The
gain  recognized  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019  was  immaterial. For  additional  details  related  to  the  interest  rate  swap  termination,
please see, “Note 10 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

The  indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  to
exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions
with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.

Commercial Paper

We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of  up  to  $1.5 billion outstanding  at  any  time  with  maturities  of  up  to  397 days  from  the  date  of  issue.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  there  were  no
commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement

In  November  2015,  we  entered  into  a  credit  agreement  that  provides  for  an  unsecured  $2 billion five-year  revolving  credit  facility.  We  may
also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount
of $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and other
general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an
up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order
to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result,
$500 million of borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2019 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.

Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875
percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate,  the federal funds effective  rate plus  0.5 percent or LIBOR plus  1.0
percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and all
amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request

51

or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date
is  extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,
affirmative  and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  The
negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum
consolidated leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to
us.

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2019.

Credit Ratings

As of December 31, 2019, we were rated investment  grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (long-term  rated BBB+, short-
term  rated  A-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  Moody’s  Investor  Service  (long-term  rated  Baa1,  short-term  rated  P-2,  with  a  stable  outlook),  and  Fitch
Ratings,  Inc.  (long-term  rated  BBB,  short-term  rated  F-2,  with  a  stable  outlook).  We  disclose  these  ratings  to  enhance  the  understanding  of  our
sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions
taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings will likely increase our borrowing costs.

Commitments and Contingencies

We  have  certain  fixed  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  include  future  estimated  payments  for  general  operating  purposes.
Changes  in  our  business  needs,  contractual  cancellation  provisions,  fluctuating  interest  rates,  and  other  factors  may  result  in  actual  payments
differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our
fixed contractual obligations and commitments (in millions):

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

•

Debt  amounts  include  the  principal  and  interest  amounts  of  the  respective  debt  instruments.  For  additional  details  related  to  our  debt,
please  see  “Note  10  –  Debt”  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  report.  This  table  does  not  reflect  any  amounts
payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding
as of December 31, 2019.

Lease amounts include payments for our operating and finance leases for office space, data centers, as well as fulfillment centers and
other corporate assets that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are
not  expected  to  differ  significantly  from  actual  results  under  our  existing  leases,  unless  a  substantial  change  in  our  headcount  needs
requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.

Purchase  obligation  amounts  include  minimum  purchase  commitments  for  advertising,  capital  expenditures  (computer  equipment,
software  applications,  engineering  development  services,  construction  contracts)  and  other  goods  and  services  entered  into  in  the
ordinary course of business.

As  we  are  unable  to  reasonably  predict  the  timing  of  settlement  of  liabilities  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits,  net,  the  table  does  not

include $285 million of such non-current liabilities included in other liabilities on our consolidated

52

balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits expected to be reduced within the next twelve months is
approximately  $19 million. See “Note 15 – Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements  included in this report for more information  on
unrecognized tax benefits.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements

As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term and long-
term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $3.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, this amount included
assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $3.4 billion. As we repatriate these funds to the U.S., we will be required to
pay income taxes in certain U.S. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs.
We have accrued deferred taxes for the tax effect of repatriating the funds to the U.S.

We actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of
principal  and  secondarily  on  improving  yield  on  these  assets.  We  diversify  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  investments  among  various
counterparties  in  order  to  reduce  our  exposure  should  any  one  of  these  counterparties  fail  or  encounter  difficulties.  To  date,  we  have  not
experienced  any  material  loss  or  lack  of  access  to  our  invested  cash,  cash  equivalents  or  short-term  investments;  however,  we  can  provide  no
assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial
markets.  At  any  point  in  time  we  have  funds  in  our  operating  accounts  and  customer  accounts  that  are  deposited  and  invested  with  third  party
financial institutions.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated
from  operations,  borrowings  available  under  our  credit  agreement  and  commercial  paper  program,  and  our  access  to  capital  markets,  will  be
sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, repayment of debt, stock repurchases and dividends for the foreseeable
future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material

effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

We  have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate
Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net
balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense
or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $4.8 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.7 billion
in cash withdrawals, held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,
which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our
indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the

53

extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. In certain cases, we have agreed to provide indemnification
for intellectual property infringement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded
in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates

General

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our
senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are
highly uncertain at the time the estimate  is made, and if different  estimates  that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting
estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  the  following
critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
The  following  descriptions  of  critical  accounting  policies,  judgments  and  estimates  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  consolidated  financial
statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.

Revenue Recognition

We  may  enter  into  certain  revenue  contracts  that  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  goods  or  services  including  discounts  on  future
services. We also may enter into arrangements to purchase services from certain customers. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment is
sometimes  required  to  determine  the  appropriate  accounting  for  these  transactions  including:  (1)  whether  services  are  considered  distinct
performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each
distinct  performance  obligation;  (3)  whether  revenue  should  be  reported  gross  (as  eBay  is  acting  as  a  principal),  or  net  (as  eBay  is  acting  as  an
agent); (4) evaluating whether a promotion or incentive is a payment to a customer; and (5) whether the arrangement  would be characterized  as
revenue  or  reimbursement  of  costs  incurred.  Changes  in  judgments  with  respect  to  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could  impact  the  timing  or
amount of revenue recognition.

Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory  tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in
which  we  operate.  Tax  laws  are  complex  and  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  the  taxpayer  and  respective  government  taxing  authorities.
Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  our  tax  expense  and  in  evaluating  our  tax  positions,  including  evaluating  uncertainties  and  the
complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Tax
positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Our
income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred tax
benefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. The
deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. As a result of U.S. tax reform and the current U.S. taxation of
deemed repatriated earnings, management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at the
balance sheet date.

Deferred  tax  assets  represent  amounts  available  to  reduce  income  taxes  payable  on  taxable  income  in  future  years.  Such  assets  arise
because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable
income from all sources,

54

including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income
rely  heavily  on  estimates  that  are  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  our  historical  experience  and  short-range  and  long-range  business
forecasts.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  we  had  a  valuation  allowance  on  certain  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  based  on  our
assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We  recognize  and  measure  uncertain  tax  positions  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  U.S.,  or  GAAP,
pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination  by  the  taxing  authorities,  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  tax  benefits  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  from
such  positions  are  then  measured  based  on  the  largest  benefit  that  has  a  greater  than  50  percent  likelihood  of  being  realized  upon  ultimate
settlement.  We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in
the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We  file  annual  income  tax  returns  in  multiple  taxing  jurisdictions  around  the  world.  A  number  of  years  may  elapse  before  an  uncertain  tax
position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution
of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as
well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the
use of cash.

The following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 2019, 2018 and 2017:

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory
rates  and  higher  than  anticipated  in  countries  where  we  have  higher  statutory  rates,  by  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  or
liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination
of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

Based  on  our  results  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  a  one-percentage  point  change  in  our  provision  for  income  taxes  as  a
percentage  of  income  before  taxes  would  have  resulted  in  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the  provision  of  approximately  $22 million,  resulting  in  an
approximate $0.03 change in diluted earnings per share.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with
the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments
and  estimates.  These  judgments  can  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cash  flows  that  an  asset  is  expected  to  generate  in  the  future  and  the
appropriate weighted average cost of capital.

As  of  December  31,  2019,  our  goodwill  totaled  $5.2  billion and  our  identifiable  intangible  assets,  net  totaled  $67  million.  We  assess  the
impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is
more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  value.  If  the  reporting  unit  does  not  pass  the  qualitative
assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market
and  discounted  cash  flow  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  The
discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. The market

55

approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. Failure to achieve these
expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of
goodwill as of August 31, 2019 and  2018. As of December 31, 2019, we determined  that  no impairment  of the carrying  value of goodwill for any
reporting units was required. See “Note 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Legal Contingencies

In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and
provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement  of income. These estimates  have been based on our assessment  of the
facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.

From time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently involved
in  legal  proceedings,  some  of  which  are  discussed  in  “Item  1A:  Risk  Factors,”  “Item  3:  Legal  Proceedings”  and  “Note  12  –  Commitments  and
Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against
us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require
significant amounts of management’s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. If the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain
claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a
significant part of our business. Any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt. In addition, adverse economic conditions and events
(including  volatility  or  distress  in  the  equity  and/or  debt  or  credit  markets)  may  impact  regional  and  global  financial  markets.  These  events  and
conditions,  including  uncertainties  and  instability  in  economic  and  market  conditions  caused  by  the  United  Kingdom’s  vote  to  exit  the  European
Union and any outcomes resulting from that vote, could cause us to write down our assets or investments. We seek to reduce earnings volatility that
may result from adverse economic conditions and events or changes in interest rates.

The primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk.
To  achieve  this  objective,  we  maintain  our  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  in  a  variety  of  asset  types,  including  bank  deposits,
government bonds and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 24% of our total cash and investments was held in cash
and cash equivalents. As such, changes in interest rates will impact interest income. As discussed below, the fair market values of our fixed rate
securities may be adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have
declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

As  of  December  31,  2019,  the  balance  of  our  corporate  debt  and  government  bond  securities  was  $2.8  billion,  which  represented
approximately 67% of  our  total  cash  and  investments.  Investments  in  both  fixed-rate  and  floating-rate  interest-earning  instruments  carry  varying
degrees of interest rate risk. The fair market value of our fixed-rate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates.
In general, fixed-rate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. While floating rate
securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed-rate securities, floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if
interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, our investment income
may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest
rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of $8 million
and $44 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate principal amount of $7.8 billion of outstanding senior notes, of which  95% bore interest at
fixed  rates.  In  2014,  we  entered  into  $2.4  billion  of  interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  had  an  economic  effect  of  modifying  the  fixed  interest
obligations associated with $1.15 billion of our 2.200% senior notes due July 2019, $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021, and $500
million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a
spread. In July 2019, $1.15 billion of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured. In addition, during the third quarter of 2019, we terminated
the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024,
which were designated as fair value hedges. As a result of the early termination hedge, accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on
termination was recorded as an increase to the long-term debt balance and is being recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a
reduction to interest expense. The gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was immaterial.

Further  changes  in  interest  rates  will  impact  interest  expense  on  any  borrowings  under  our  revolving  credit  facility,  which  bear  interest  at
floating  rates,  and  the  interest  rate  on  any  commercial  paper  borrowings  we  make  and  any  debt  securities  we  may  issue  in  the  future  and,
accordingly,  will impact interest expense. For additional details related to our debt, see “Note 10 – Debt” to the consolidated financial statements
included in this report.

Equity Price Risk

Equity Investments

Our equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. Our consolidated results of operations include, as a component
of interest and other, net, our share of the net income or loss of the equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Equity
investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable price
changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. Such changes in the basis of the equity
investment are recognized in interest and other, net. As of December 31, 2019, our equity

57

investments totaled $355 million, which represented approximately 9% of our total cash and investments, and were primarily related to equity
investments without readily determinable fair values.

Warrant

We  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  conjunction  with  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,
entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrant
is  accounted  for  as  a derivative  instrument  under  ASC  Topic  815,  Derivatives  and  Hedging.  Changes  in Adyen’s  common  stock  price  and equity
volatility  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  value  of  the  warrant.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  a  one  dollar  change  in  Adyen’s  common  stock,
holding other factors constant, would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrant by approximately $1 million. For additional details related to
the warrant, please see “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our  commerce  platforms  operate  globally,  resulting  in  certain  revenues  and  costs  that  are  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  primarily  the
euro, British pound, Korean won and Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We
transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs. In addition, we charge our international
subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operations
and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may
record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities.

We  have  a  foreign  exchange  exposure  management  program  designed  to  identify  material  foreign  currency  exposures,  manage  these
exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the
purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. The effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is
at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting. For additional details related to our derivative instruments, please see “Note 7
– Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

We use foreign exchange derivative contracts to help protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.
Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the derivative’s gain or loss
is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same
period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the derivative’s gain
or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income. However, only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cash
flow hedge accounting.

The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and net investment
hedges, and the before-tax  effect  on fair values of a hypothetical  adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of  December 31,
2019.  The  sensitivity  for  foreign  currency  contracts  is  based  on  a  20%  adverse  change  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  against  relevant  functional
currencies.

Since our risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in

the value of the underlying exposure.

We also use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements
on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency

58

gains  and  losses  on  the  assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  in  interest  and  other,  net,  which  are  offset  by  the  gains  and  losses  on  the  foreign
exchange contracts.

We  considered  the  historical  trends  in  currency  exchange  rates  and  determined  that  it  was  reasonably  possible  that  adverse  changes  in
exchange  rates  of  20%  for  all  currencies  could  be  experienced  in  the  near  term.  These  changes  would  have  resulted  in  an  adverse  impact  on
income before income taxes of approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2019 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange
forwards in place as of December 31, 2019.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the
related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2019, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2019 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  We also have audited the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of
December  31,  2019  and  2018,  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2019  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  Management’s  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our  audits  of the  consolidated  financial statements  included performing  procedures  to assess the risks of  material  misstatement  of the  consolidated  financial
statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,
evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures in the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also included  evaluating  the  accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness
exists, and  testing and evaluating  the design  and operating  effectiveness  of internal control  based on the  assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on
the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the
critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Income Taxes

As described in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in
evaluating management’s tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. As disclosed by management, the
Company’s income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to their foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred tax
benefit derived from the amortization of the Company’s intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. The
deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates. Management recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, pursuant to which management only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The total provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $415 million, and the effective tax rate was 18.8%.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to income taxes is a critical audit matter are there is significant judgment
applied by management when determining the tax expense and in evaluating management’s tax positions, including analyzing uncertain tax positions and taxes
on foreign earnings, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence
relating to income taxes.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes, including controls over uncertain tax positions and the
provision for income taxes. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating tax positions taken by management, including evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s determination of the probability of sustaining the position under tax examination, evaluating communications with the relevant
tax authorities, testing applicable tax rates applied by management, and evaluating the impact of taxes on foreign earnings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

eBay Inc.

Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Founded in 1995 in San Jose,
California,  eBay  is  one  of  the  world’s  largest  and  most  vibrant  marketplaces  for  discovering  great  value  and  unique  selection.  Collectively,  we
connect  millions  of  buyers  and  sellers  around  the  world,  empowering  people  and  creating  opportunity  for  all.  Our  technologies  and  services  are
designed to give buyers choice and a breadth of relevant inventory and to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale,
virtually anytime and anywhere.

When we refer to “we,” “our,” “us” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and

its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.

In  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  we  announced  several  organizational  changes,  including  bringing  our  Marketplace  geographic  regions  together
under one global leadership team. We changed from one reportable segment to three reportable segments to reflect the way management and our
chief  operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  review  and  assess  performance  of  the  business.  Our  three reportable  segments  are  Marketplace,
StubHub and Classifieds. Marketplace includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite of
mobile  apps.  StubHub  includes  our  online  ticket  platform  located  at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobile
apps.  Classifieds  includes  a  collection  of  brands  such  as  Mobile.de,  Kijiji,  Gumtree,  Marktplaats,  eBay  Kleinanzeigen  and  others.  Prior  period
information has been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation. For further information on our segments, refer to “Note 5 –
Segments” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

On November 24, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of viagogo to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion, subject to
certain adjustments. The completion, on our expected timeline, of the proposed sale of StubHub is subject to closing conditions and viagogo’s ability
to obtain debt and equity financing on a timely basis, both of which have not been met as of December 31, 2019. If the conditions to the closing of
the  sale  of  StubHub  are  neither  satisfied  nor,  where  permissible,  waived  on  a  timely  basis  or  at  all,  we  may  be  unable  to  complete  the  sale  of
StubHub or such completion may be delayed beyond our expected timeline. Given the uncertainty, we have determined as of December 31, 2019
the  transaction  is  not  considered  probable  to  close.  As  such,  StubHub  continues  to  be  classified  as  held  for  use  in  our  December  31,  2019
consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction losses, legal contingencies, income taxes, revenue
recognition,  stock-based  compensation,  investments,  goodwill  and  the  recoverability  of  intangible  assets.  We  base  our  estimates  on  historical
experience  and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying  financial  statements  are  consolidated  and  include  the  financial  statements  of  eBay  Inc.,  our  wholly  and  majority-owned
subsidiaries  and  variable  interest  entities  (“VIE”)  where  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation. Minority interests are recorded as a noncontrolling interest. A qualitative approach is applied to assess the consolidation
requirement for VIEs. Investments in entities where we hold at least a 20% ownership interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence,
but not control, over the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, our share of the investees’ results
of operations is included in interest and other, net and our investment balance is included in long-term investments. Investments in entities where we
hold less than a 20% ownership

F-9

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

interest  are  generally  accounted  for  as  equity  investments  to  be  measured  at  fair  value  or,  under  an  election,  at  cost  if  it  does  not  have  readily
determinable  fair  value,  in  which  case  the  carrying  value  would  be  adjusted  upon  the  occurrence  of  an  observable  price  change  in  an  orderly
transaction for identical or similar instruments or impairment.

Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue when we transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequently
remitted to governmental authorities.

Net transaction revenues

Our net transaction revenues primarily include final value fees, feature fees, including fees to promote listings, and listing fees from sellers in
our Marketplace and final value fees from sellers and buyers on our StubHub platforms. Our net transaction revenues also include store subscription
and other fees often from large enterprise sellers. Our net transaction revenues are reduced by incentives provided to our customers.

We identified one performance  obligation to sellers on our Marketplace  platform,  which is to connect buyers and sellers on our secure and
trusted  Marketplace  platforms.  Final  value  fees  are  recognized  when  an  item  is  sold  on  a  Marketplace  platform,  satisfying  this  performance
obligation. There may be additional services  available to Marketplace  sellers, mainly to promote or feature listings,  that are not distinct within the
context of the contract. Accordingly, fees for these additional services are recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied. Promoted
listing fees are recognized when the item is sold and feature and listing fees are recognized when an item is sold, or when the contract expires. On
our StubHub platform, our performance obligation extends to both buyers and sellers. We made the policy election to consider delivery of tickets in
our StubHub platform to be fulfillment activities and, consequently, the performance obligation is satisfied, and final value fees are recognized, upon
payment to sellers.

Store  subscription  and  other  nonstandard  listing  contracts  may  contain  multiple  performance  obligations,  including  discounts  on  future
services.  Determining  whether  performance  obligations  should  be  accounted  for  separately  or  combined  may  require  significant  judgment.  The
transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). In instances where SSP is not directly
observable, we generally estimate selling prices based on when they are sold to customers of a similar nature and geography. These estimates are
generally based on pricing strategies, market factors, strategic objectives and observable inputs. Store subscription revenues are recognized over
the  subscription  period,  and  discounts  offered  through  store  subscription  or  nonstandard  listing  contracts  are  recognized  when  the  options  are
exercised or when the options expire.

Further, to drive traffic to our platforms, we provide incentives to buyers and sellers in various forms including discounts on fees, discounts on
items  sold,  coupons  and  rewards.  Evaluating  whether  a  promotion  or  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  may  require  significant  judgment.
Promotions and incentives which are consideration payable to a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the later of when revenue is
recognized or when we pay or promise to pay the incentive. Promotions and incentives to most buyers on our Marketplace platforms, to whom we
have no performance obligation, are recognized as sales and marketing expense. In addition, we may provide credits to customers when we refund
certain  fees.  Credits  are  accounted  for  as  variable  consideration  at  contract  inception  when  estimating  the  amount  of  revenue  to  be  recognized
when  a  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  of  revenue  will  not  occur  and  updated  as
additional information becomes available.

Marketing services and other revenues

Our  marketing  services  and  other  revenues  are  derived  principally  from  the  sale  of  advertisements,  classifieds  fees,  and  revenue  sharing
arrangements. Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of online advertisements which are based on “impressions” (i.e., the number
of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our platforms) or “clicks” (which are generated each time users on our platforms
click through our advertisements to an advertiser’s designated website) delivered to advertisers. We use the output method and apply the practical
expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. For contracts

F-10

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

with target advertising commitments with rebates, estimated payout is accounted for as a variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

We generate net revenues related to fees for listing items on our Classifieds platforms, which are recognized over the estimated period of the
classifieds listing and fees to feature the listing that are recognized over the feature period or a point in time depending on the nature of the feature
purchased. Discounts offered through purchase of packages of multiple services are allocated based on the SSP of each respective feature.

Revenues related to revenue sharing arrangements are recognized based on whether we are the principal and are responsible for fulfilling the
promise  to  provide  the  specified  services  or  whether  we  are  an  agent  arranging  for  those  services  to  be  provided  by  our  partners.  Determining
whether we are a principal or agent in these contracts may require significant judgment. If we are the principal, we recognize revenue in the gross
amount of consideration received from the customer, whereas if we are an agent, we recognize revenue net of the consideration due to our partners
at  a  point  in  time  when  the  services  are  provided.  Our  most  significant  revenue  share  arrangements  are  with  shipping  service  providers.  We  are
primarily acting as an agent in these contracts and revenues are recognized at a point in time when we have satisfied our promise of connecting the
shipping service provider to our customer.

Refer to “Note 5 – Segments” for further information, including revenue by types and geographical markets.

Contract balances

Timing  of  revenue  recognition  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  invoicing  to  customers.  Accounts  receivable  represents  amounts  invoiced  and
revenue  recognized  prior  to  invoicing  when  we  have  satisfied  our  performance  obligation  and  have  the  unconditional  right  to  payment.  The
allowance for doubtful accounts and authorized credits is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience,
the  age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances,  current  economic  conditions  and  other  factors  that  may  affect  our  customers’  ability  to  pay.  The
allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  and  authorized  credits  was  $128  million and  $106  million as  of  December  31,  2019 and  December  31,  2018,
respectively.

Deferred revenue consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period. Due to the generally short-
term  duration  of  contracts,  the  majority  of  the  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  in  the  following  reporting  period.  The  amount  of  revenue
recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was
$93 million. The amount of revenue recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 that was included in the deferred revenue balance
at the beginning of the period was $96 million.

Internal use software and platform development costs

Direct  costs  incurred  to  develop software  for  internal  use  and platform  development  costs  are  capitalized  and amortized  over  an estimated
useful  life  of  one to  five years.  During  the  years  ended  December 31, 2019 and  2018,  we  capitalized  costs,  primarily  related  to  labor  and  stock-
based compensation, of $137 million and $147 million, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $150 million, $160 million
and  $156  million for  2019,  2018 and  2017,  respectively.  Costs  related  to  the  design  or  maintenance  of  internal  use  software  and  platform
development are expensed as incurred.

Advertising expense

We expense the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in
the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used, in each case as sales and marketing expense. Internet advertising expenses are
recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered
over  the  total  number  of  contracted  impressions,  on  a  pay-per-click  basis,  or  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  contract.  Advertising
expense totaled $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

F-11

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock-based compensation

We  have  equity  incentive  plans under  which  we  grant  equity  awards,  including  stock  options,  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”),  performance-
based  restricted  stock  units,  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  We  primarily  issue  RSUs.  We  determine
compensation  expense  associated  with  RSUs  based  on  the  fair  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant.  We  determine  compensation
expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally
recognize  compensation  expense  using  a  straight-line  amortization  method  over  the  respective  vesting  period  for  awards  that  are  ultimately
expected  to  vest.  Accordingly,  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  2019, 2018 and  2017 has  been  reduced  for  estimated  forfeitures.  When
estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. We recognize a benefit or provision
from  stock-based  compensation  in  earnings  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  to  the  extent  that  an  incremental  tax  benefit  or  deficiency  is
realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law.

Provision for transaction losses

Provision  for  transaction  losses  consists  primarily  of  losses  resulting  from  our  buyer  protection  programs,  fraud  and  bad  debt  expense
associated  with  our  accounts  receivable  balance.  Provisions  for  these  items  represent  our  estimate  of  actual  losses  based  on  our  historical
experience and many other factors including changes to our protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes as well as economic conditions.

Income taxes

Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the
complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Tax
positions are evaluated for potential reserves for uncertainty based on the estimated probability of sustaining the position under examination. Our
income tax rate is affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings including U.S. minimum taxes on foreign earnings. The deferred tax
benefit derived from the amortization of our intellectual property is based on the fair value, which has been agreed with foreign tax authorities. The
deferred tax benefit may from time to time change based on changes in tax rates.

We  account  for  income  taxes  using  an  asset  and  liability  approach,  which  requires  the  recognition  of  taxes  payable  or  refundable  for  the
current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effects of future
changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. If necessary, the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits
that are not expected to be realized based on available evidence.

We  report  a  liability  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  resulting  from  uncertain  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We

recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, which

may include bank deposits, US Treasury securities, time deposits, and certificates of deposit.

Investments

Short-term investments are investments with original maturities of less than one year when purchased, are classified as available-for-sale and
are  reported  at  fair  value  using  the  specific  identification  method.  Short-term  investments  are  primarily  comprised  of  corporate  debt  securities,
commercial paper, and agency securities.

Long-term  investments  are  primarily  comprised  of  corporate  debt  securities,  agency  securities,  and  equity  investments.  Debt  securities  are

classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value using the specific identification method.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  our  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported  as  a  component  of  other

comprehensive income (loss), net of related estimated income tax provisions or benefits.

Our equity investments are primarily investments in privately-held companies. We account for equity investments through which we exercise
significant  influence  but  do  not  have  control  over  the  investee  under  the  equity  method.  Our  consolidated  results  of  operations  include,  as  a
component  of  interest  and  other,  net,  our  share  of  the  net  income  or  loss  of  the  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of
accounting. Our share of investees’ results of operations is not significant for any period presented. Our equity investments not accounted for under
the  equity  method  are  carried  at  under  the  measurement  alternative.  Under  the  measurement  alternative,  the  carrying  value  is  measured  at  cost
minus  impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus  changes  resulting  from  observable  price  changes  in  orderly  transactions  for  the  identical  or  a  similar
investment of the same issuer. Such changes in the basis of the equity investment are recognized in interest & other, net.

We periodically perform  impairment  assessment  review of our debt and equity investments.  For debt securities,  this assessment  takes into
account the severity and duration of the decline in value, our intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to
sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is,
whether a credit loss exists). If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the
corresponding charge as interest & other, net. For equity investments we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an
impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in interest
& other, net.

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating and finance lease liabilities are recognized based on
the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit
in the lease is not readily determinable for our operating leases, we generally use an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at
the commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and finance lease assets
are generally recognized based on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to ten
years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one
year. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component for our data center leases. Lease and non-lease components for all other leases are accounted for separately.

Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated
balance  sheets.  Finance  leases  are  included  in  property  and  equipment,  net,  short-term  debt,  and  long-term  debt  on  our  consolidated  balance
sheet.

Property and equipment

Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation.  Depreciation  for  equipment,  buildings  and  leasehold
improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful  lives  of  the  assets,  generally,  one to  three years  for  computer  equipment  and  software,  up  to  thirty years  for  buildings  and  building
improvements, the shorter of five years or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements and three years for furniture, fixtures and vehicles. Land
is not depreciated.

Goodwill and intangible assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment can be performed to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass
the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit’s carrying value is compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated
using  income  and  market  approaches.  Goodwill  is  considered  impaired  if  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value.  The
discounted cash flow method, a form of the income approach, uses expected future operating results and a market participant discount rate. The
market approach uses comparable company prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions (either publicly traded entities
or mergers and acquisitions) to develop pricing metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results of our reporting units. Failure
to achieve these expected results, changes in the discount rate or market pricing metrics may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting
unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of August 31, 2019 and 2018 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value
of goodwill for any reporting units was required.

Intangible assets consist of purchased customer lists and user base, marketing related, developed technologies and other intangible assets,
including patents and contractual agreements.  Intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method
and estimated useful lives ranging from one to five years. No significant residual value is estimated for intangible assets.

Impairment of long-lived assets

We  evaluate  long-lived  assets  (including  intangible  assets)  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the
carrying  amount  of  a  long-lived  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  An  asset  is  considered  impaired  if  its  carrying  amount  exceeds  the  undiscounted
future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, no impairment was noted.

Foreign currency

Most  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  local  currency  of  their  respective  countries  as  their  functional  currency.  Assets  and  liabilities  are
translated  into  U.S.  dollars  using  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  while  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  average
exchange rates during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of our consolidated balance sheet are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income.

Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as interest and other, net.

Derivative instruments

We use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, options and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
We may also use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. We
do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We  also  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  addition  to  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,
entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrant
is accounted for as a derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.

See “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments” for a full description of our derivative instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Concentration of credit risk

Our cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative instruments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and
cash equivalents are placed with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our accounts receivable are derived from
revenue earned from customers. In each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net
revenues.  Our  derivative  instruments  expose  us  to  credit  risk  to  the  extent  that  our  counterparties  may  be  unable  to  meet  the  terms  of  the
agreements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  new  guidance  related  to  accounting  for  leases.  The  new  guidance
requires the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous
guidance.  We  adopted  this  guidance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019  using  the  modified  retrospective  approach,  electing  the  package  of  practical
expedients,  and  the  practical  expedient  to  not  separate  lease  and  nonlease  components  for  data  center  operating  leases.  We  also  elected  the
optional transition method that permits adoption of the new standard prospectively, as of the effective date, without adjusting comparative periods
presented. Adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of $728 million of ROU assets and $744 million of lease liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet at adoption related to office space, data and fulfillment centers, and other corporate assets. The difference of $16 million represented
deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of right-of-use assets. The adoption of
the standard on January 1, 2019 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows.

In 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the
earliest call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing. The new guidance will not impact debt securities held at a
discount. Adoption of this standard was made on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings
as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim  reporting  periods  within  those  annual  reporting  periods.  The  adoption  of  the  standard  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019  did  not  have  a  material
impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

In  2018,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  accounting  for  nonemployee  share-based  payment  transactions  by  expanding  the
scope of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from
nonemployees.  Under  the  new  standard,  most  of  the  guidance  on  stock  compensation  payments  to  nonemployees  would  be  aligned  with  the
requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of the standard in the first quarter of 2019 did not have
an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In  2018,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  to  permit  use  of  the  Overnight  Index  Swap  (“OIS”)  rate  as  a  U.S.  benchmark  interest  rate  for  hedge
accounting  purposes  in  addition  to  the  UST,  the  London  InterBank  Offered  Rate  (“LIBOR”)  swap  rate,  the  OIS  rate  based  on  the  Fed  Funds
Effective Rate, and the Securities Industry and Financial Market Association Municipal Swap Rate. This guidance is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of the standard
in the first quarter of 2019 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at
the  net  amount  expected  to  be  collected,  not  based  on  incurred  losses.  Further,  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  should  be
recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The new standard is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. This standard impacts the Company’s accounting for
allowances for doubtful accounts, available-for-sale securities and other assets subject to credit risk. In preparation for the adoption of this standard,
we will update our credit loss models as needed. The Company has completed its analysis of the impact of this guidance and the adoption of this
standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

F-15

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In  2017,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  simplify  the  subsequent  measurement  of  goodwill  by  removing  the  requirement  to  perform  a
hypothetical  purchase  price  allocation  to  compute  the  implied  fair  value  of  goodwill  to  measure  impairment.  Instead,  any  goodwill  impairment  will
equal  the  amount  by  which  a  reporting  unit’s  carrying  value  exceeds  its  fair  value,  not  to  exceed  the  carrying  amount  of  goodwill.  Further,  the
guidance eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it
fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment
test in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloud
computing arrangement that is hosted by the vendor (i.e., a service contract). Under the new guidance, customers will apply the same criteria for
capitalizing  implementation  costs  as  they  would  for  an  arrangement  that  has  a  software  license.  This  standard  is  effective  for  annual  reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard will not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In  2018,  the  FASB  issued  new  guidance  to  clarify  the  interaction  between  Collaborative  Arrangements  and  Revenue  from  Contracts  with
Customers  standards.  The  guidance  (1)  clarifies  that  certain  transactions  between  collaborative  arrangement  participants  should  be  accounted
under revenue guidance; (2) adds unit of account guidance to the collaborative arrangement guidance to align with the revenue standard; and (3)
clarifies presentation guidance for transactions with a collaborative arrangement participant that is not accounted for under the revenue standard.
The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those annual
reporting periods. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles
and also simplification of areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition of
enactment of tax laws or rate changes. The standard will be effective for our annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including
interim  reporting  periods  within  those  fiscal  years.  We  are  evaluating  the  impact  of  adopting  this  new  accounting  guidance  on  our  consolidated
financial statements.

Note 2 – Net Income (loss) Per Share

Basic  net  income  (loss)  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  for  the  period  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of
diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares.

In  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  we  announced  several  organizational  changes,  including  bringing  our  Marketplace  geographic  regions  together
under one global leadership team. We changed from one reportable segment to three reportable segments to reflect the way management and our
chief  operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”)  review  and  assess  performance  of  the  business.  Our  three reportable  segments  are  Marketplace,
StubHub and Classifieds. Marketplace includes our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay suite of
mobile  apps.  StubHub  includes  our  online  ticket  platform  located  at  www.stubhub.com,  its  localized  counterparts  and  the  StubHub  mobile  apps.
Classifieds includes a collection of brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. The accounting policies
of our segments are the same as those described in “Note 1 – The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. Prior period segment
information has been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation.

Our reportable segments reflect the way management and our CODM review and assess performance of the business. Our CODM reviews
revenue  and  operating  income  (loss)  for  each  reportable  segment.  Our  CODM  does  not  evaluate  reportable  segments  using  asset  information.
Corporate  and  other  costs  includes:  (i)  corporate  management  costs,  such  as  human  resources,  finance  and  legal,  that  are  not  allocated  to  our
segments;  (ii)  amortization  of  intangible assets;  (iii)  restructuring  charges;  (iv)  stock-based  compensation;  and (v)  results  of  operations  of  various
initiatives that support all of our reportable segments.

Net revenues, inclusive of the effects of foreign exchange during each period, are attributed to U.S. and international geographies primarily
based upon the country in which the seller, platform that displays advertising, other service provider, or customer, as the case may be, is located.
Long-lived  assets  attributed  to  the  U.S.  and  international  geographies  are  based  upon  the  country  in  which  the  asset  is  located  or  owned.
Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily recorded in the Marketplace segment.

Restricted cash is held primarily in interest bearing accounts for letters of credit primarily related to our global sabbatical program and various
lease  arrangements.  Our  fixed-income  investments  consist  of  predominantly  investment  grade  corporate  debt  securities  and  government  and
agency securities. The corporate debt and government and agency securities that we invest in are generally deemed to be low risk based on their
credit ratings from the major rating agencies.

The  longer  the  duration  of  these  securities,  the  more  susceptible  they  are  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  bond  yields.  As  interest
rates  increase,  those  securities  purchased  at  a  lower  yield  show  a  mark-to-market  unrealized  loss.  The  unrealized  losses  are  due  primarily  to
changes in credit spreads and interest rates. We regularly review investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative
and quantitative criteria. We presently do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and expect to realize the full value of
all these investments upon maturity or sale.

Investment securities in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months had an estimated fair value of $774 million and an immaterial
amount of unrealized losses as of December 31, 2019, and an estimated fair value of $2.9 billion and an immaterial amount of unrealized losses as
of December 31, 2018. Investment securities in a continuous loss position for greater than 12 months had an estimated fair value of $92 million and
an immaterial amount of unrealized losses as of December 31, 2019 and an estimated fair value of $2.7 billion and unrealized losses of $41 million
December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, these securities had a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 2 months. Refer to
“Note 17 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” for amounts reclassified to earnings from unrealized gains and losses.

The  estimated  fair  values  of  our  short-term  and  long-term  investments  classified  as  available-for-sale  by  date  of  contractual  maturity  as  of

In 2019, we invested $160 million in cash in exchange for an equity interest in Paytm Mall and $40 million in other investments. These

investments are accounted for as equity investments without readily determinable fair value.

In 2018, we sold our investment in Flipkart and relinquished our existing equity method investment in Giosis as part of the exchange for the
acquisition of Giosis’ Japan business. The $313 million gain upon sale of our investment in Flipkart and the $266 million gain upon relinquishment of
our  equity  method  investment  in  Giosis  were  recorded  in  interest  and  other,  net  on  our  consolidated  statement  of  income.  Refer  to  “Note  3  –
Business Combinations” for further details on the Giosis acquisition.

In 2017, we made a cost method investment of $50 million. In addition, we received a 5.44% ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our

eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment, resulting in an investment of $725 million accounted for as an equity investment without
readily determinable fair value. The gain on disposal of our eBay India business of $167 million was recorded in interest and other, net on our
consolidated statement of income. In addition, we recorded a $61 million impairment charge to write-down our cost method investment in Jasper
Infotech Private Limited (“Snapdeal”). The investment was measured at fair value due to events and circumstances that we identified as having
significant impact on its fair value. The fair value measurement of the impaired investment was measured using significant unobservable inputs. The
impairment charge, representing the difference between the net book value and the fair value, was recorded to interest and other, net.

The  following  table  summarizes  the  total  carrying  value  of  equity  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  during  the  twelve

months ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in millions):

For such equity investments without readily determinable fair values still held at December 31, 2019, cumulative downward adjustments for
price changes and impairment was $81 million. As of December 31, 2019, there have been no upward adjustments for price changes to our equity
investments without readily determinable fair values.

Note 7 – Derivative Instruments

Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign exchange rate and
interest rate movements. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes.

We  use  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  cash  flows  related  to  forecasted  revenues,  expenses,  assets  and
liabilities, including intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are generally one month to one year in duration, but
with maturities up to 24 months. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that ultimately the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash
flows  are  not  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  the  applicable  U.S.  dollar/foreign  currency  exchange  rate.  We  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our
foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges on a quarterly basis.

We used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2024.
These interest rate swaps had the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with $2.4 billion of these notes so that the
interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR plus a spread. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding
as of December 31, 2019.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Cash Flow Hedges

For  derivative  instruments  that  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially  reported  as  a  component  of
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (“AOCI”)  and  subsequently  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  same  period  the  forecasted  hedged
transaction  affects  earnings.  Derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  must  be  de-designated  as  hedges  when  it  is  probable  the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Unrealized gains and
losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are immediately reclassified into earnings. As of December 31, 2019, we have estimated
that approximately $2 million of  net  derivative  loss  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  included  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  will  be
reclassified  into  earnings  within  the  next  12  months.  We  classify  cash  flows  related  to  our  cash  flow  hedges  as  operating  activities  in  our
consolidated statement of cash flows.

Net Investment Hedges

For  derivative  instruments  that  are  designated  as  net  investment  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially  reported  in  the  translation
adjustments  component  of  AOCI  and  is  reclassified  to  net  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  the  hedged  subsidiary  is  either  sold  or  substantially
liquidated.

Fair Value Hedges

We designated the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on our fixed rate notes issued in July 2014 and maturing in 2019,
2021 and 2024 as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for them as fair value hedges. These transactions were designated as fair value
hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protected us against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to
benchmark  interest  rate  movements.  In  2019,  $1.15  billion related  to  our  2.200% senior  notes  due  2019  of  the  $2.4  billion aggregate  notional
amount matured. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2019, we terminated the interest rate swaps related to $750 million of
our 2.875% senior  notes  due  July  2021  and  $500 million of  our  3.450% senior  notes  due  July  2024.  As  a  result  of  the  early  termination,  hedge
accounting  was  discontinued  prospectively  and  the  gain  on  termination  was  recorded  as  an  increase  to  the  long-term  debt  balance  and  is  being
recognized over the remaining life of the underlying debt as a reduction to interest expense. The gain recognized during the year ended December
31, 2019 was immaterial.

Non-Designated Hedges

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary
assets  or  liabilities,  including  intercompany  balances  denominated  in  non-functional  currencies.  The  gains  and  losses  on  our  derivatives  not
designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest and other, net, which are offset by the foreign currency gains and losses on the related
assets and liabilities that are also recorded in interest and other, net. We classify cash flows related to our non-designated hedging instruments as
operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Warrant

We  entered  into  a  warrant  agreement  in  conjunction  with  a  commercial  agreement  with  Adyen  that,  subject  to  meeting  certain  conditions,
entitles us to acquire a fixed number of shares up to 5% of Adyen’s fully diluted issued and outstanding share capital at a specific date. The warrant
has  a  term  of  seven years  and  will  vest  in  a  series  of  four tranches,  at  a  specified  price  per  share  upon  meeting  significant  processing  volume
milestone  targets  on  a  calendar  year  basis.  If  and  when  the  relevant  milestone  is  reached,  the  warrant  becomes  exercisable  with  respect  to  the
corresponding tranche of warrant shares up until the warrant expiration date of January 31, 2025. The maximum number of tranches that can vest in
one calendar year is two.

The warrant is accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. We report the warrant at fair value within other
assets in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair value of the warrant are recognized in interest and other, net in our consolidated
statement  of  income.  The  day-one  value  attributable  to  the  other  side  of  the  warrant,  which  was  recorded  as  a  deferred  credit,  is  reported  within
other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the life of the commercial arrangement.

Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our derivative contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are
allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have elected to present
the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, the potential effect of
rights  of  set-off  associated  with  the  foreign  exchange  contracts  would  be  an  offset  to  both  assets  and  liabilities  by  $25  million,  resulting  in  net
derivative assets of $43 million and net derivative liabilities of less than $1 million.

viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as

Credit Risk

Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We seek to
mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to, and by spreading the risk across, major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss
with  any  one  counterparty  resulting  from  this  type  of  credit  risk  is  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis.  To  further  limit  credit  risk,  we  also  enter  into
collateral security arrangements related to certain interest rate derivative instruments whereby collateral is posted between counterparties if the fair
value of the derivative instrument exceeds certain thresholds. Additional collateral would be required in the event of a significant credit downgrade
by either party. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative transactions.

Our financial assets and liabilities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1), less active markets (Level 2) and little or
no market activity (Level 3). Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving
identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments
in  less  active  markets,  or  models  using  market  observable  inputs.  Level  3  instrument  valuations  typically  reflect  management’s  estimate  of
assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability.  We  did  not  have  any  transfers  of  financial  instruments  between
valuation levels during 2019 or 2018.

The majority of our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models that take into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs
where  applicable,  such  as  equity  prices,  interest  rate  yield  curves,  option  volatility  and  currency  rates.  Our  warrant,  which  is  accounted  for  as  a
derivative  instrument,  is  valued  using  a  Black-Scholes  model.  Key  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  include  risk-free  interest  rates;  Adyen’s
common stock price, equity volatility and common stock outstanding; exercise price; and details specific to the warrant. The value is also probability
adjusted for management assumptions with respect to meeting the processing volume milestone targets. These assumptions and the probability of
meeting processing volume milestone targets may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. Refer to “Note 7 – Derivative Instruments”
for further details on our derivative instruments.

Other  financial  instruments,  including  accounts  receivable  and  accounts  payable,  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  their  fair  value

because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Senior Notes

In 2019, $400 million of  floating  rate  notes  and  $1.15 billion of  2.200% fixed  rate  notes  matured  and  were  repaid.  In  2018,  $750 million of

2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018 matured and were repaid.

None of the floating rate notes are redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed
rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time
to time prior to their maturity, generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.150% fixed rate notes due 2020, the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022, the
floating rate notes due 2023, the 2.750% fixed rate notes due 2023, the 3.600% fixed rate notes due 2027 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056,
we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The  indenture  pursuant  to  which  the  senior  notes  were  issued  includes  customary  covenants  that,  among  other  things  and  subject  to
exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions
with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.

To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered
into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR plus a spread.
These  swaps  were  designated  as  fair  value  hedges  against  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  certain  fixed  rate  senior  notes  resulting  from  changes  in
interest rates. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the
hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in market interest rates. In 2019, $1.15 billion related to our  2.200% senior
notes of the $2.4 billion aggregate notional amount matured.  In addition,  during the  three months  ended September  30, 2019, we terminated  the
interest rate swaps related to $750 million of our 2.875% senior notes due July 2021 and $500 million of our 3.450% senior notes due July 2024. As
a result of the early termination, hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively and the gain on termination was recorded as an increase to the
long-term  debt  balance  and  is  being  recognized  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  underlying  debt  as  a  reduction  to  interest  expense.  The  gain
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was immaterial.

The effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of
any  original  issue  discount  on  these  senior  notes.  Interest  on  these  senior  notes  is  payable  either  quarterly  or  semiannually.  Interest  expense
associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was
approximately $301 million, $318 million and $307 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated fair value of these senior
notes, using Level 2 inputs, was approximately $7.9 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively.

Commercial Paper

We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes in an aggregate principal amount at maturity
of up to $1.5 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were
no commercial paper notes outstanding.

Credit Agreement

In  November  2015,  we  entered  into  a  credit  agreement  that  provides  for  an  unsecured  $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility.  We may
also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate amount
of $1 billion. Funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and other
general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under our $2 billion credit agreement. However, as described above, we have an
up to $1.5 billion commercial paper program and therefore maintain $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order
to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event

F-31

we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. As a result, $500 million of borrowing capacity was available
as of December 31, 2019 for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.

Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.875
percent to 1.5 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate,  the federal funds effective  rate plus  0.5 percent or LIBOR plus  1.0
percent, plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.5 percent. The credit agreement will terminate and all
amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on November 9, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request
or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date
is  extended  upon  our  request,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the  lenders.  The  credit  agreement  includes  customary  representations,  warranties,
affirmative  and  negative  covenants,  including  financial  covenants,  events  of  default  and  indemnification  provisions  in  favor  of  the  banks.  The
negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum
consolidated leverage ratio. The events of default include the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) with respect to
us.

We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2019.

Commitments

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material

effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

We  have  a  cash  pooling  arrangement  with  a  financial  institution  for  cash  management  purposes.  This  arrangement  allows  for  cash
withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution (“Aggregate
Cash Deposits”). This arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net
balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense
or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $4.8 billion in aggregate cash deposits, partially offset by $4.7 billion
in cash withdrawals, held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Litigation and Other Legal Matters

Overview

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis. Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an
indeterminate amount of damages. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the
estimated liability in our financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in
our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the
low  end  of  the  range.  For  those  proceedings  in  which  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  but  not  probable,  we  have  disclosed  an
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses
arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate the
probable  or  reasonably  possible  loss  or  range  of  losses  arising  from  a  proceeding,  we  have  disclosed  that  fact.  In  assessing  the  materiality  of  a
proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies
sought  by  plaintiffs  (e.g.,  injunctive  relief)  that  may  require  us  to  change  our  business  practices  in  a  manner  that  could  have  a  material  adverse
impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 12, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that
could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.

Amounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019.  Except  as  otherwise  noted  for  the  proceedings  described  in  this  Note  12,  we  have  concluded,  based  on  currently  available
information,  that  reasonably  possible  losses  arising  directly  from  the  proceedings  (i.e.,  monetary  damages  or  amounts  paid  in  judgment  or
settlement)  in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and
subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations,  the  impact  on  our  operating  results  or  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  material.  Legal  fees  are  expensed  as
incurred.

General Matters

Third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We
are subject to patent disputes, and expect that we could be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business
as  our  products  and  services  continue  to  expand  in  scope  and  complexity.  Such  claims  may  be  brought  directly  or  indirectly  against  us  and/or
against our customers (who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us), and we are subject to increased exposure
to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business. We have in the past been
forced to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the
Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are

F-35

eBay Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

interpreted by the courts, and as we expand the scope of our business (both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our
geographical  operations)  and  become  subject  to  laws  in  jurisdictions  where  the  underlying  laws  with  respect  to  the  potential  liability  of  online
intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. We believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent, copyright
or  trademark  laws  will  be  filed  against  us.  Intellectual  property  claims,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  are  time  consuming  and  costly  to  defend  and
resolve, could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements
on unfavorable terms.

From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including suits by our
users (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, improper disclosure of our prices, rules or policies, that our practices, prices,
rules, policies or customer/user agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly and/or not acted in conformity with such practices,
prices,  rules,  policies  or  agreements.  Further,  the  number  and  significance  of  these  disputes  and  inquiries  are  increasing  as  the  political  and
regulatory landscape changes and, as we have grown larger, our businesses have expanded in scope (both in terms of the range of products and
services  that  we  offer  and  our  geographical  operations)  and  our  products  and  services  have  increased  in  complexity.  Any  claims  or  regulatory
actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage awards (including statutory damages for
certain  causes  of  action  in  certain  jurisdictions),  injunctive  relief  or  increased  costs  of  doing  business  through  adverse  judgment  or  settlement,
require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant
operational resources or otherwise harm our business.

Indemnification Provisions

We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with PayPal to govern the separation and relationship
of the two companies. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and PayPal,
which may be significant. In addition, the indemnity rights we have against PayPal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our
indemnity obligations to PayPal may be significant.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors, executive officers and certain other officers. These
agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become
subject as a result of their affiliation with us.

In the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we
have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application programming interface license agreements. Under these
contracts,  we generally  indemnify,  hold harmless  and agree  to  reimburse  the  indemnified  party  for  losses  suffered  or incurred  by the indemnified
party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that
such  marks  are  applicable  to  our  performance  under  the  subject  agreement.  In  certain  cases,  we  have  agreed  to  provide  indemnification  for
intellectual  property  infringement.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  our
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.

To date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant,

either individually or collectively.

Note 13 – Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series; to establish the number
of  shares  included  within  each  series;  to  fix  the  rights,  preferences  and  privileges  of  the  shares  of  each  wholly  unissued  series  and  any  related
qualifications, limitations or restrictions; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series (but not below the number of shares of a
series then outstanding) without any further vote or action by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 10 million shares of
$0.001 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and no shares issued or outstanding.

Common Stock

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 3.6 billion shares of common stock.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and,
subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic and programmatic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding
share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately
negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated
at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and
regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.

In  January  2018,  our  Board  of  Directors  (“Board”)  authorized  a  $6.0  billion stock  repurchase  program,  and  in  January  2019,  our  Board
authorized an additional 4.0 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization.
The stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during 2019 was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans

Equity Incentive Plans

We  have  equity  incentive  plans under  which  we  grant  equity  awards,  including  stock  options,  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”),  performance-
based  restricted  stock  units  (“PBRSUs”),  stock  payment  awards  and  performance  share  units,  to  our  directors,  officers  and  employees.  As  of
December 31, 2019, 755 million shares were authorized under our equity incentive plans and 55 million shares were available for future grant.

Stock options granted under these plans generally vest 12.5% six months from the date of grant (or  25% one year from the date of grant for
grants to new employees) with the remainder vesting at a rate of 2.08% per month thereafter, and generally expire seven to ten years from the date
of grant. RSU awards granted to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest in annual or quarterly installments over a period
of three to five years, are subject to the employees’ continuing service to us and do not have an expiration date.

In 2019, 2018 and  2017,  certain  executives  were  eligible  to  receive  PBRSUs.  PBRSU  awards  are  subject  to  performance  and  time-based
vesting  requirements.  The  target  number  of  shares  subject  to  the  PBRSU  award  are  adjusted  based  on  our  business  performance  measured
against the performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Generally, if the performance
criteria are satisfied, one-half of the award vests in March following the end of the performance period and the other half of the award vests in March
of the following year.

Deferred Stock Units

Prior  to  December  31,  2016,  we  granted  deferred  stock  units  to  each  non-employee  director  (other  than  Mr.  Omidyar)  at  the  time  of  our
annual meeting of stockholders and to new non-employee directors upon their election to the Board. Each deferred stock unit award granted to a
new non-employee director upon election to the Board vests 25% one year from the date of grant, and at a rate of  2.08% per month thereafter. In
addition, directors were permitted to elect to receive, in lieu of annual retainer and committee chair fees and at the time these fees would otherwise
be payable, fully vested deferred stock units with an initial value equal to the amount based on the fair market value of common stock at the date of
grant. Following termination of a non-employee director’s service on the Board, deferred stock units granted prior to August 1, 2013 are payable in
stock or cash (at our election), while deferred stock units granted on or after August 1, 2013 are payable solely in stock. As of December 31, 2019,
there  were  approximately  207,179 deferred  stock  units  outstanding,  which  are  included  in  our  restricted  stock  unit  activity  below.  As  of
December 31, 2016, we no longer grant deferred stock units.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We  have  an  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (“ESPP”)  for  all  eligible  employees.  Under  the  plan,  shares  of  our  common  stock  may  be
purchased  over  an  offering  period  with  a  maximum  duration  of  two years  at  85% of  the  lower  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  first  day  of  the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the six-month purchase period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10%
of their eligible compensation during an offering period. During 2019, 2018, and 2017, employees purchased approximately 3 million, 4 million and 4
million shares under this plan at average prices of  $25.24, $23.82 and $22.32 per share, respectively. As of  December 31, 2019, approximately 9
million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance.

Stock Option Activity

No stock options were granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our equity incentive plans was $20 million, $18 million
and  $26  million,  respectively,  determined  as  of  the  date  of  option  exercise.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  options  to  purchase  approximately  800
thousand shares of our common stock were outstanding and in-the-money.

As  of  December  31,  2019,  there  was  approximately  $768 million of  unearned  stock-based  compensation  that  will  be  expensed  from  2020
through  2023.  If  there  are  any  modifications  or  cancellations  of  the  underlying  unvested  awards,  we  may  be  required  to  accelerate,  increase  or
cancel all or a portion of the remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future unearned stock-based compensation will increase to
the extent we grant additional equity awards, change the mix of grants between stock options and restricted stock units or assume unvested equity
awards in connection with acquisitions.

Employee Savings Plans

We  have  a  defined  contribution  plan,  which  is  qualified  under  Section  401(k)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  Participating  employees  may
contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In  2019, 2018 and 2017, we contributed one dollar for each
dollar  a  participant  contributed,  with  a  maximum  contribution  of  4% of  each  employee’s  eligible  compensation,  subject  to  a  maximum  employer
contribution of $11,200, $11,000 and  $10,800 per employee for each period, respectively.  Our non-U.S.  employees are covered by various other
savings plans. Total expense for these plans was $64 million, $60 million and $57 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities  and  their  respective  tax  bases  using  enacted  tax  rates  in  effect  for  the  year  in  which  the  differences  are  expected  to  be  reversed.
Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in millions):

Deferred tax assets:

Net operating loss, capital loss and credits

Accruals and allowances

Stock-based compensation

Amortizable tax basis in intangibles

Net deferred tax assets

Valuation allowance

As of December 31, 2019, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  for income tax purposes were approximately  $11
million, $55 million and  $361 million,  respectively.  The  federal  and  state  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  are  subject  to  various  limitations  under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows: $12 million
do not expire, $246 million are subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2020, and  $104 million are not subject to valuation allowance
but will begin to expire in 2024. As of December 31, 2019, state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $140 million.
Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily

to operating losses in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized.

During the first half of 2017, we recognized a noncash income tax charge of $376 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a
deferred tax asset related to intangible assets in our foreign eBay platforms. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved a step-up in the tax basis of the
intangible assets in our foreign Classifieds platforms as a result of voluntary domiciling our Classifieds intangible assets into a new jurisdiction and
recognized a tax benefit of $695 million.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. U.S. tax reform, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal income tax
rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, instituted a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation
of  unremitted  foreign  earnings  in  2017  and  created  a  new  U.S.  minimum  tax  on  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries.  We  recognized  a  provisional
income tax charge of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included as a component of the income tax provision on our consolidated
statement  of  income.  We  completed  our  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  U.S.  tax  reform  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018  and  recognized  a  $463 million
reduction  to  the  provisional  tax  amounts  recorded  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017,  which  is  included  as  a  component  of  income  tax  expense  from
continuing operations in 2018.

Included in the 2017 provisional amount was $1.4 billion for  the income  tax on the deemed repatriation  of unremitted  foreign  earnings. We
completed the computation of this amount as part of the 2017 income tax return filing and reduced the provisional amount by  $18 million and we
utilized $213 million of foreign tax credits to reduce the net

F-41

eBay Inc.

liability,  both  in  2018.  We  elected  to  pay  the  liability  for  the  deemed  repatriation  of  foreign  earnings  in  installments,  as  specified  by  the
Act. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $884 million and $968 million of our liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was
included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

The  remaining  provisional  amount  of  $1.7 billion was  for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act,  primarily  the  impact  of  the  new  U.S.
minimum tax on foreign earnings, partially offset by the reversal of our existing deferred tax liability associated with repatriation of unremitted foreign
earnings. We completed our analysis of the components of the deferred tax computation in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recognized a tax benefit of
$445 million as  a reduction  to  the  provisional  amounts  recorded  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2017 for  the  deferred  income  tax  effects  of  the  Act.  This
amount  includes  a  $389  million tax  benefit  as  a  result  of  clarification  by  Swiss  tax  authorities  regarding  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  to
repatriated earnings in October 2018.

We have recognized the tax consequences of all foreign unremitted earnings and management has no specific plans to indefinitely reinvest
the  unremitted  earnings  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  We  have  not  provided  for  deferred  taxes  on  outside  basis
differences  in  our  investments  in  our  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  unrelated  to  unremitted  earnings.  These  basis  differences  will  be  indefinitely
reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis difference is not practicable.

The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):

Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of the period

Included within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $387 million as of December 31,  2019 is $55 million of unrecognized tax
benefits indemnified by PayPal. If total unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $285 million. Of
this amount, approximately $51 million of unrecognized tax benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reduced upon
a  future  realization.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  our  liabilities  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  were  included  in  other  liabilities  on  our  consolidated
balance sheet.

We  recognize  interest  and/or  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  in  income  tax  expense.  In  2019,  $8  million was  included  in  tax
expense for interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $46 million
and $61 million, respectively.

We  are  subject  to  both  direct  and  indirect  taxation  in  the  U.S.  and  various  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  are  under  examination  by
certain  tax  authorities  for  the  2008  to  2018  tax  years.  We  believe  that  adequate  amounts  have  been  reserved  for  any  adjustments  that  may
ultimately result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities for tax
years after 2007 include, among others, the U.S. (Federal and California), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Although  the  timing  of  the  resolution  and/or  closure  of  audits  is  highly  uncertain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  balance  of  gross
unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the
number  of  matters  being  examined,  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  full  range  of  possible  adjustments  to  the  balance  of  gross  unrecognized  tax
benefits. We expect the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next twelve months by at least $19 million.

On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatment
of  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  an  intercompany  cost-sharing  arrangement.  A  final  decision  was  issued  by  the  Tax  Court  in  December
2015.  The  IRS  appealed  the  decision  in  June  2016.  On  July  24,  2018,  the  Ninth  Circuit  Federal  Court  issued  a  decision  that  was  subsequently
withdrawn and a

F-42

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

reconstituted  panel  has  conferred  on  the  appeal.  On  June  7,  2019,  the  Ninth  Circuit  Federal  Court  upheld  the  cost-sharing  regulations  and  on
November 11, 2019 the U.S. Tax Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit released a court order denying an en banc rehearing of the case Altera Corp.
v Commissioner following Altera’s petition filed on July 22, 2019. It has not been determined if this ruling will be further appealed as of the date of
our filing. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits or obligations,
and the risk of the Tax Court’s decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any benefit or expense as of December 31, 2019. We
will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.

During  the  first  quarter  of  2019,  management  approved  a  plan  to  drive  operational  improvement  that  included  the  reduction  of  workforce,
primarily  in  our  Marketplace  segment.  The  reduction  was  substantially  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019  and  resulted  in  pre-tax  restructuring
charges  of  approximately  $41  million.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019,  management  approved  a  plan  to  drive  operational  improvement  that
included the reduction of workforce, primarily in our Marketplace segment. We incurred a pre-tax charge of $36 million, which was primarily related
to employee severance and benefits.

In June 2018, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of our existing global workforce, primarily in our Marketplace
segment. The reduction was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2018 and resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately
$86 million.

No restructuring charges were recognized in 2017.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Exhibit 4.15

As of December 31, 2019, eBay Inc. had the following two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”): (i) its common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“common stock”), and (ii) its
6.00% Notes due 2056.

References in the following discussion to “eBay,” “eBay Inc.,” “we,” “our” and “us” and similar references mean eBay Inc.

excluding, unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise expressly stated, its subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

The following is a description of some of the terms of our common stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the
“charter”), our amended and restated bylaws (the “bylaws”) and certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).
The following description is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our charter and bylaws, each of which
is filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, and the DGCL. You
should read our charter and bylaws and the applicable provisions of the DGCL for a complete statement of the provisions described under this
caption “Description of Common Stock” and for other provisions that may be important to you.

Common Stock

Under our charter, the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which we are authorized to issue is 3,590,000,000 shares,
consisting  of  two  classes:  3,580,000,000  shares  of  common  stock  and  10,000,000  shares  of  preferred  stock,  $0.001  par  value  per  share
(“preferred stock”).

Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders. Our
charter does not entitle the holders of our common stock to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of our directors. This means
that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election by our
common stockholders (assuming there are no outstanding shares of our preferred stock entitled to vote as a single class with our common
stock in such election).

Nominees for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders shall stand for election to a one-year term expiring at the next
annual  meeting  of  stockholders  and  until  their  respective  successors  are  duly  elected  and  qualified,  subject  to  earlier  death,  resignation,
retirement or removal. Pursuant to our bylaws and subject to the rights of any series of our preferred stock that may be outstanding, each
member  of  our  board  of  directors  shall  be  elected  by  the  affirmative  vote  of  a  majority  of  the  votes  cast  with  respect  to  such  director
(excluding abstentions) by the shares represented and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present; provided,
however, that if our board of directors determines that the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected at
such meeting (a “Contested Election”) and has not rescinded that determination as provided in our bylaws, each of the directors to be elected
at such meeting shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented and entitled to vote at such
meeting with respect to the election of such director. If an incumbent director fails to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast at a meeting for the election of directors

(other than a Contested Election), either our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or a committee of independent directors shall
determine whether to accept or reject any resignation that may have been previously tendered by such incumbent director or whether other
action  should  be  taken  (including  whether  to  request  the  incumbent  director  to  resign  from  the  board  of  directors  if  no  resignation  has
previously been tendered).

Unless  otherwise  provided  by  applicable  law,  the  rules  or  regulations  of  any  applicable  stock  exchange,  or  our  charter  or  bylaws,
every matter to be voted on by our stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of
a  majority  in  voting  power  of  the  shares  of  our  stock  entitled  to  vote  thereon  that  are  present  in  person  or  represented  by  proxy  at  the
applicable meeting.

Our bylaws require us to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name of any person nominated for
election to our board of directors by a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of up
to 20 beneficial owners who own and have owned, in each case continuously for at least three years, at least 3% (determined as provided in
our  bylaws)  of  the  aggregate  voting  power  of  our  outstanding  common  stock  and  any  other  capital  stock  entitled  to  vote  generally  in  the
election of directors; provided that such stockholders give us written notice of such request within the time period set forth in our bylaws and
such stockholders and their nominees satisfy the other requirements specified in our bylaws; and provided, further, that the number of such
nominees whose names appear in our proxy materials shall not exceed the greater of (x) two nominees and (y) the largest whole number of
nominees that does not exceed 20% of the number of our directors then in office, subject to possible reduction as provided in our bylaws.

Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock to receive dividends before any dividends may be
paid on our common stock, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in any dividends payable on our common stock
that may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.

Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share
ratably  in  any  of  our  assets  remaining  for  distribution  to  our  common  stockholders  after  payment  of  or  provision  for  our  debts  and  other
liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock to receive distributions in the event of our
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up before distributions are made to holders of our common stock.

Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights.

Under our charter, our board of directors is authorized, without vote or other action by our stockholders, to cause the issuance of up to
10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock in one or more series from time to time, to establish the number of shares to be included in each such
series  and  to  fix  the  designation,  powers,  preferences  and  rights  of  the  shares  of  each  such  series  (which  may  include,  without  limitation,
voting rights, dividend rights and preferences, liquidation rights and preferences, redemption provisions and rights to convert the preferred
stock of such series into other securities or property) and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, and to increase or decrease the
number  of  shares  of  any  such  series  (but  not  below  the  number  of  shares  of  such  series  then  outstanding).  Our  board  of  directors  may
authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation, conversion or other rights (which may include, without limitation,
rights  of  one  or  more  series  of  preferred  stock,  voting  as  a  separate  class,  to  elect  one  or  more  directors,  rights  of  one  or  more  series  of
preferred stock to vote with our common stock in the election of directors, and rights to receive dividends and to receive distributions in the
event of our liquidation,

2

dissolution or winding-up before any dividends or distributions may be paid to holders of our common stock) that could dilute or otherwise
adversely affect the voting power or the dividend, liquidation or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred
stock,  while  providing  flexibility  in  connection  with  possible  acquisitions,  financings  and  other  corporate  purposes,  could,  among  other
things,  have  the  effect  of  delaying,  deterring  or  preventing  a  merger,  change  of  control  or  other  takeover  of  our  company  that  our
stockholders  might  consider to  be  in  their  best  interests,  including  transactions that  might  result  in a  premium  being  paid over  the  market
price of our common stock, and may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any other securities that we may issue
and the voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights of the holders of our common stock.

Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law

We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (“Section 203”). In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation
from engaging in “business combination” transactions with any “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the time that the
stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:

•

•

•

prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the corporation’s board of directors approved either the applicable
business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

upon  consummation  of  the  transaction  which  resulted  in  the  stockholder  becoming  an  interested  stockholder,  the  interested
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding
for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) shares owned
by directors who are also officers of the corporation and shares owned by employee stock plans in which the employee participants
do  not  have  the  right  to  determine  confidentially  whether  shares  held  subject  to  the  plan  will  be  tendered  in  a  tender  or  exchange
offer; or

at  or  subsequent  to  the  time  that  the  stockholder  became  an  interested  stockholder,  the  business  combination  is  approved  by  the
corporation’s board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66-
2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

A  “business  combination”  is  defined  to  include,  among  other  things  and  in  general  and  subject  to  exceptions,  a  merger  of  the
corporation  with  the  interested  stockholder;  a  sale  of  10%  or  more  of  the  market  value  of  the  corporation’s  consolidated  assets  to  the
interested stockholder; certain transactions that result in the issuance of the corporation’s stock to the interested stockholder; a transaction that
has the effect of increasing the proportionate  share of the corporation’s stock owned by the interested stockholder; and any receipt by the
interested stockholder of loans, guarantees or other financial benefits provided by the corporation. An “interested stockholder” is defined to
include, in general and subject to exceptions, a person that (1) owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation or (2) is
an “affiliate” or “associate” (as defined in Section 203) of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding
voting stock at any time within the prior three year period.

A  Delaware  corporation  may  opt  out  of  Section  203  with  an  express  provision  in  its  original  certificate  of  incorporation  or  by  an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to be governed by Section 203 and approved by a majority of
its outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out of Section 203. As a result, Section 203 could delay, deter or prevent a merger, change
of control or other takeover of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests, including

3

transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our common stock, and may also adversely affect the market
price of our common stock and any other securities that we may issue.

Anti-Takeover Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring

or seeking to acquire control of us. For example, our charter and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

authorize our board of directors, without vote or other action by our stockholders, to cause the issuance of preferred stock in one or
more series from time to time and, with respect to each series, to establish the number of shares constituting that series and to fix the
rights and other terms of that series, which may include, without limitation, voting rights, dividend rights and preferences, liquidation
rights and preferences and rights to convert the preferred stock of such series into other securities or property;

provide that, subject to the rights of any series of our preferred stock that may be outstanding, vacancies on our board of directors or
newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directors
then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director;

provide that the number of directors constituting our board of directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by our
board of directors;

require  that actions  to  be taken  by  our  stockholders must  be  taken at  an  annual or  special  meeting  of  our  stockholders  and not  by
written consent;

establish advance notice procedures and other requirements for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our
board of directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;

provide  that,  subject  to  the  rights  of  any  series  of  preferred  stock  that  may  be  outstanding  and  except  as  may  be  required  by  law,
special  meetings  of  stockholders  may  be  called  only  by  (1)  our  board  of  directors;  (2)  our  Chairman  of  the  Board;  (3)  our  Chief
Executive Officer; or (4) our Secretary upon the written request of one or more of our stockholders that have continuously held, for
their own account or on behalf of others, at least a 20% aggregate “net long position” (as defined and determined as provided in our
bylaws) of our outstanding common stock for at least 30 days as of the date such request is delivered to us and that have complied
with the other requirements set forth in our bylaws; and

do not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, which means that the
holders  of  a  majority  of  our  outstanding  shares  of  common  stock  can  elect  all  directors  standing  for  election  by  our  common
stockholders.

The provisions described above are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids
and to encourage anyone seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. However, these provisions may also
delay, deter or prevent a merger, change of control or other takeover of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best
interests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our common stock,

4

and may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any other securities that we may issue. These provisions may also
have the effect of preventing changes in our management.

Limitation on Liability of Directors; Indemnification of Directors and Officers

Our charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of our directors shall be personally liable for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted
by the DGCL. We believe that these limitations of liability and indemnification provisions are useful to attract and retain qualified directors
and officers.

DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

Our  6.00%  Notes  due  2056  (the  “notes”)  were  issued  under  an  indenture  dated  as  of  October  28,  2010  (the  “base  indenture”),  as
amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of October 28, 2010 (the “supplemental indenture;” the base indenture, as
amended and supplemented  by the supplemental indenture, is hereinafter  called  the “indenture”), each  between us  and Wells Fargo Bank,
National  Association,  as  trustee.  The  description  of  the  notes  is  contained  in  two  parts.  The  first  part,  contained  under  this  caption
“Description of Notes,” describes some of the specific terms of the notes and some of the specific terms of the indenture that are applicable to
the notes. The second part, contained under the caption “Description of Indenture” below, provides a more general description of some of the
terms of the indenture and the debt securities (the “debt securities”) issuable by us under the indenture. The discussion of some of the terms
of the notes and the indenture contained under this caption “Description of Notes” supplements, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the
description  of  some  of  the  general  terms  of  the  indenture  and  the  debt  securities  contained  below  under  the  caption  “Description  of
Indenture.”  To  the  extent  the  discussion  of  some  of  the  terms  of  the  notes  and  the  indenture  appearing  under  this  caption  “Description  of
Notes” differs from the discussion of some of the terms of the indenture and the debt securities appearing under the caption “Description of
Indenture,” you should rely on the discussion under this caption “Description of Notes.” Certain terms used but not defined under this caption
“Description of Notes” have the meanings specified below under the caption “Description of Indenture—Covenants.”

We may issue our debt securities under the indenture from time to time in one or more series. The notes are a separate series of our
debt securities issued and outstanding under the indenture, which means that, for purposes of giving any consent, notice or waiver or taking
any other action under the indenture, the registered holders of the notes will act separately from the registered holders of each other series of
our debt securities that may be outstanding under the indenture from time to time. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise
requires,  references  to  “debt  securities”  under  this  caption  “Description  of  Notes”  and  the  caption  “Description  of  Indenture”  below  shall
include the notes.

The description of some of the terms of the notes and the indenture contained under this caption “Description of Notes” and under the
caption “Description of Indenture” are not complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, the indenture and the

General

The notes were originally issued on February 29, 2016. The notes constitute a separate series of debt securities under the indenture,

were issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 and will mature on February 1, 2056.

We may from time to time, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes, issue
additional notes having the same terms (except for the issue date, public offering price, sale price, the first interest payment date and the date
from which interest shall begin to accrue) as, and ranking equally in right of payment with, the notes then outstanding. Any such additional
notes, together with the notes then outstanding, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture.

The notes are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “EBAYL.”

The notes are issuable in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 in principal amount and in integral multiples
of  $25  in  principal  amount  in  excess  thereof.  The  notes  are  in  book-entry  form  and  are  evidenced  by  one  or  more  notes  in  global  form
(“global notes”), registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), as depositary (the “Depositary”) for the global notes, or
its nominee. Beneficial owners of interests in the global notes are not entitled to receive physical certificates registered in their names except
in  the  limited  circumstances  described  below  under  “Description  of  Indenture  —  Book-Entry  Form  and  Transfer”  and,  unless  physical
certificates registered in their names are issued, beneficial owners will not be considered “holders” of notes under the indenture.

The  notes  are  not  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  any  sinking  fund.  Except  as  described  below  under  “—Change  of  Control  Triggering
Event,” the indenture does not contain any provisions which are intended to protect holders of notes in the event of a change of control of
eBay  or  a  highly  leveraged  transaction  (whether  or  not  relating  to  a  change  of  control)  involving  eBay.  The  indenture  does  not  limit  the
incurrence of unsecured debt by us or any of our subsidiaries.

We may at our option, at any time or from time to time, repurchase notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, and may hold

or resell such notes or surrender such notes to the trustee for cancellation.

Ranking

The notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior
unsecured indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to
the extent of the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, the notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing
and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, which are separate legal entities from us and have no obligation to pay any
amounts due pursuant to the notes or to make funds available for such purpose.

Interest

The notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per year, accruing from the most recent date to which we have paid or provided for interest
on the notes. Interest on the notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year (each, an
“interest payment date”). Interest paid on the notes on any interest payment date is payable to the persons who were the registered holders of
the notes at the close of  business on  the  January  15, April  15, July 15  or October 15, as  the case may be, whether or  not a business day,
immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date.

6

Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable
on the notes on any interest payment date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below), maturity date or other date
on which interest on the notes is due will be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, such interest payment date, redemption date,
Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. If an interest payment date, redemption date, Change of
Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date on which any payment on the notes is due falls on a day that is not a business day, then
payment  of  principal,  premium,  if  any,  and  interest,  as  the  case  may  be,  due  on  such  interest  payment  date,  redemption  date,  Change  of
Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be, need not be made on such interest payment date, redemption date,
Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date as the case may be, but may be made on the next succeeding business day, and
no  interest  on  such  payment  shall  accrue  for  the  period  from  and  after  such  interest  payment  date,  redemption  date,  Change  of  Control
Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. As used in this paragraph and the immediately preceding paragraph, the term
“business day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized
or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close (a “New York business day”); provided that such term shall mean, with respect to
any place of payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the notes, any day (a) which is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on
which banking institutions in such place of payment are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close and (b) which
is also a New York business day.

Optional Redemption

On  and  after  March  1,  2021,  we  may  at  our  option  redeem  the  notes,  at  any  time  in  whole  or  from  time  to  time  in  part,  at  a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal
amount of the notes being redeemed to the applicable redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments of interest on the notes that are due and payable on any interest payment dates falling on or
prior to a date fixed for redemption of the notes will be payable to the holders of the notes registered as such at the close of business on the
relevant record dates according to their terms and the terms and provisions of the indenture.

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, then, if the notes are evidenced by one or more global notes, the notes to be redeemed
will be selected in accordance with the procedures of the Depositary, or, if the notes are evidenced by notes in definitive, physical form issued
under the limited circumstances described below under “Description of Indenture — Book-Entry Form and Transfer,” the trustee shall select
the  notes  (or  portions  thereof)  to  be  redeemed  in  any  manner  that  the  trustee  deems  fair  and  appropriate.  Notes  may  be  selected  for
redemption in whole or in part in a minimum of $25 in principal amount and integral multiples of $25 in principal amount in excess thereof,
provided that the remaining principal amount of any note redeemed in part is $25 or an integral multiple of $25 in excess thereof.

Notice of any redemption shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the

notes to be redeemed.

Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest shall cease to accrue on the notes or

portions thereof called for redemption.

Change of Control Triggering Event

If  a  Change  of  Control  Triggering  Event  (as  defined  below)  occurs  with  respect  to  the  notes,  then,  unless  we  give  notice  of  our
election to redeem all of the notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption” and such notice is given by the date specified below,
we will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of notes to repurchase (at such holder’s option and on the
terms  described  below)  all  or  any  part  (in  a  principal  amount  of  $25  or  an  integral  multiple  of  $25  in  excess  thereof,  provided  that  any
remaining principal amount of any note repurchased in part is $25 or an integral multiple of $25 in excess thereof) of such holder’s notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes
repurchased to the Change of Control Payment Date (as defined below) (the “Change of Control Payment”); provided that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, payments of interest on notes that are due and payable on any interest payment dates falling on or prior to such Change of
Control  Payment  Date  will  be  payable  to  the  holders  of  the  notes  registered  as  such  at  the  close  of  business  on  the  relevant  record  dates
according to their terms and the terms and provisions of the indenture.

No later than 30 days following the date on which a Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred with respect to the notes
or, at our option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below) but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or
may constitute the Change of Control, we will, unless we give notice of our election to redeem all of the notes as described above under “—
Optional Redemption” and such notice is given by the date specified below, mail or cause to be mailed (or, in the case of notes evidenced by
one  or  more  global  notes,  give  or  cause  to  be  given  in  accordance  with  the  Depositary’s  procedures)  a  notice  (the  “Change  of  Control
Purchase Notice”) to all holders of notes (with a copy to the trustee), which notice shall govern the terms of such Change of Control Offer. In
such  Change  of  Control  Purchase  Notice,  we  will  generally  describe  the  transaction  or  transactions  that  constitute  or  may  constitute  the
Change of Control and offer to repurchase the notes on the date specified in such notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no
later  than  60  days  after  the  date  such  notice  is  mailed  (or  given,  as  the  case  may  be),  except  as  may  be  required  by  applicable  law  or
regulation (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). The Change of Control Purchase Notice shall, if mailed (or given, as the case may be)
prior to occurrence of the applicable Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer for the notes and our obligation to purchase
the notes pursuant to such Change of Control Offer are conditioned on such Change of Control and the related Change of Control Triggering
Event with respect to the notes occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date specified in such notice.

Holders electing to have a note or portion thereof repurchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes will be
required  to  surrender  the  note  (which,  in  the  case  of  notes  evidenced  by  one  or  more  global  notes,  must  be  made  in  accordance  with  the
procedures of the Depositary), together with a duly completed and executed notice of holder to elect repurchase in the form attached to the
notes (which may, in the case of notes evidenced by one or more global notes, be given in accordance with the Depositary’s procedures), to
the trustee under the indenture (or to such other person as may be designated by us for such purpose) as provided in the applicable Change of
Control  Purchase  Notice  prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  third  business  day  immediately  preceding  the  applicable  Change  of  Control
Payment Date and to comply with other procedures and requirements set forth in such Change of Control Purchase Notice. As used in the
preceding sentence, the term “business day” means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City
of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.

On any Change of Control Payment Date with respect to the notes, we shall be required, to the extent lawful, to:

•

•

accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the applicable Change of Control Offer;

deposit  with  a  paying  agent  for  the  notes  an  amount  equal  to  the  aggregate  Change  of  Control  Payment  in  respect  of  all  notes  or
portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the applicable Change of Control Offer; and

deliver  or  cause  to  be  delivered  (including  by  book-entry  transfer,  if  applicable)  the  repurchased  notes  or  portions  of  notes  to  the
trustee, accompanied by an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes accepted by us for repurchase.

Interest on notes and portions of notes properly tendered for repurchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue on
and after the applicable Change  of Control Payment Date, unless we shall  have failed to accept such notes and such portions of notes for
payment or failed to deposit the Change of Control Payment in respect thereof in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. We
will promptly pay, or cause the trustee or a paying agent for the notes to promptly pay (by application of funds deposited by us as aforesaid),
to each holder of notes (or portions thereof) properly tendered and accepted for payment by us pursuant to such Change of Control Offer, the
Change of Control Payment for such notes. In the case of any note repurchased in part, the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or
cause to be delivered by book-entry transfer) to the holder of such note a new note equal in principal amount to any unrepurchased portion of
the note repurchased in part.

We will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the
extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the
notes or the indenture, we shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached our obligations
under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the notes or the indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the indenture or the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the notes, we will
not be required to make a Change of Control Offer for the notes or repurchase any notes pursuant to any Change of Control Offer for such
notes  if  (a)  a  third  party  agrees  to  make  such  Change  of  Control  Offer  in  the  manner,  at  the  times  and  otherwise  in  compliance  with  the
requirements for an offer made by us and such third party repurchases all notes properly tendered by the holders pursuant to such Change of
Control Offer or (b) we give notice of redemption of all of the notes no later than 30 days after the applicable Change of Control Triggering
Event with respect to the notes. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the indenture or the Change of Control Triggering
Event  provisions  of  the  notes,  we  will  not  be  required  to,  and  we  will  not,  repurchase  notes  pursuant  to  a  Change  of  Control  Offer  with
respect to the notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the applicable Change of Control Payment Date an event of default (as defined
under “Description of Indenture—Events of Default” below) with respect to the notes or the debt securities of any other series outstanding
under the indenture.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following:

(a)    the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is
that any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than us or any of our Subsidiaries (as defined
under “Description of Indenture — Covenants — Certain Definitions” below)) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules
13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our

9

outstanding Voting Stock (measured by voting power rather than number of shares), provided, however, that a person shall not be
deemed the beneficial owner of, or to own beneficially, (1) any securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or
on behalf of such person or any of such person’s affiliates (as defined in the indenture) until such tendered securities are accepted for
purchase  or  exchange  thereunder  or  (2)  any  securities  if  such  beneficial  ownership  arises  solely  as  a  result  of  a  revocable  proxy
delivered in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act;

(b)    the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of us and our Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, to any person (other than us or any of our Subsidiaries);

(c)    the first day on which a majority of the members of our board of directors (which term, as used in this definition, means

our full board of directors and not any committees thereof) are not Continuing Directors;

(d)    the adoption of a plan by our board of directors relating to our liquidation or dissolution; or

(e)    we consolidate with, or merge with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, us, in
any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of our outstanding Voting Stock or the outstanding Voting Stock of such other
person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of our
Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the
outstanding Voting Stock (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) of the surviving person, or any direct or indirect
parent of the surviving person, immediately after giving effect to such transaction.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in clause (a) of the first sentence of this definition, the term “person,” as used in this definition, has
the meaning set forth in the indenture.

“Change  of  Control  Triggering  Event”  means  the  occurrence  of  both  a  Change  of  Control  and  a  Rating  Event  with  respect  to  the
notes. For purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that no Change of Control Triggering Event shall be deemed to have occurred with
respect to the notes in connection with any particular Change of Control unless and until such Change of Control has actually occurred.

“Continuing Directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of our board of directors (which term, as used in this
definition, means our full board of directors and not any committees thereof) who (a) was a member of our board of directors on the date the
notes were first issued or (b) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to our board of directors with the approval of or by a majority
of the Continuing Directors who were members of our board of directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by
vote  or  written  consent  or  by  approval  of  our  proxy  statement  in  which  such  member  was  named  as  a  nominee  for  election  as  a  director
without written objection to such nomination).

“Exchange  Act”  means  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  or  any  successor  thereto,  in  each  case  as  amended  or

supplemented from time to time.

10

“Investment Grade Rating” means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody’s and BBB- (or the equivalent)
by S&P, and a rating equal to or higher than the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Rating
Agencies selected by us.

“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

“Rating  Agencies”  means  (a)  each  of  Moody’s  and  S&P;  and  (b)  if  Moody’s  or  S&P  or,  if  applicable,  any  replacement  Rating
Agency  ceases  to  rate  the  notes  or  fails  to  make  a  rating  of  the  notes  publicly  available  for  reasons  outside  of  our  control,  a  “nationally
recognized statistical rating organization” (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act) selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s,
S&P or any such replacement Rating Agency, as the case may be.

“Rating Event” means the rating on the notes is lowered by both of the Rating Agencies and as a result the notes are rated below an
Investment Grade Rating by both of the Rating Agencies, in each case on any day during the period (the “Measurement Period”) commencing
on the date of the first public announcement of an arrangement that results in a Change of Control and ending on the 60th day following the
first public announcement of the occurrence of such Change of Control (which Measurement Period shall be extended (subject to the proviso
below) if on such 60th day (x) the rating of the notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by either Rating
Agency and (y) the rating on the notes by such Rating Agency is an Investment Grade Rating, such extension to continue until the day on
which each such Rating Agency considering such possible downgrade either rates the notes below an Investment Grade Rating or publicly
announces that it is no longer considering the notes for a possible downgrade; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such extension
will occur if on such 60th day, and any such extension will terminate if at any time after such 60th day, the notes have an Investment Grade
Rating  from  at  least  one  Rating  Agency  and  are  not  under  publicly  announced  consideration  for  a  possible  downgrade  by  such  Rating
Agency).

“S&P” means Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, Inc.

“Voting  Stock”  means,  with  respect  to  any  person,  any  Capital  Stock  (as  defined  under  “Description  of  Indenture  –  Covenants  –
Certain Definitions” below) of such person that is normally entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any contingency) to vote generally in
the election of directors, managers, trustees or similar persons, as applicable, of such person.

As used under this caption “—Change of Control Triggering Event,” all references to rules and regulations under the Exchange Act
shall  include  any  successor  provisions  thereto;  and  all  references  to  “the  Change  of  Control  Triggering  Event  covenant,”  “the  Change  of
Control Triggering Event provisions” and other similar references mean all of the terms and provisions set forth above under this caption “—
Change of Control Triggering Event.”

If we are required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient
financial  resources  available,  or  that  we  will  be  able  to  arrange  sufficient  financing,  to  satisfy  our  obligation  to  repurchase  the  notes.
Moreover, any such failure to repurchase the notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event could constitute an
event of default under other debt instruments of ours and our subsidiaries resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other
indebtedness. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and on the market value of the
notes.

The Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the notes may not provide holders of notes protection in the event of highly

leveraged transactions, reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or similar

11

transactions involving us that might adversely affect holders of notes. In particular, any such transaction may not give rise to a Change of
Control Triggering Event with respect to the notes, in which case we would not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect
to the notes. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, neither the notes nor the indenture contain
provisions that permit holders of notes to require us to repurchase or repay the notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
similar transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries.

In addition, clause (b) of the definition of “Change of Control” appearing above includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect
sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation) of “all or substantially all” of the properties and
assets of us and our Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the properties and assets of us and our Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, may be uncertain.

Moreover, under clause (c) of the definition of Change of Control appearing above, a Change of Control will occur when a majority
of the members of our board of directors are not “Continuing Directors” (as defined above). In a decision in connection with a proxy contest,
a Delaware court held that the existing directors could approve a dissident slate of director nominees (who would constitute a majority of the
new board of  directors)  as  “continuing  directors”  under  a similar indenture provision  and avoid triggering  a change of control under such
indenture,  provided  the  incumbent  directors  give  their  approval  in  the  good  faith  exercise  of  their  fiduciary  duties.  Therefore,  in  certain
circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of our board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest where
our board of directors does not endorse a dissident slate of directors but approves them as “Continuing Directors” for purposes of the Change
of Control Triggering Event provisions, holders of the notes may not be entitled to require us to make a Change of Control Offer with respect
to the notes.

Covenant Defeasance, Legal Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge

The  provisions  described  below  under  “Description  of  Indenture—  Defeasance  of  Debt  Securities  and  Certain  Covenants”  and
“Description  of  Indenture  —Satisfaction  and  Discharge”  are  applicable  with  respect  to  the  notes.  In  that  regard,  the  covenants  described
below  under  “Description  of  Indenture—Covenants,”  insofar  as  they  apply  to  the  notes,  are  subject  to  covenant  defeasance  as  described
below under “Description of Indenture— Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants.” However, the provisions described above
under “– Change of Control Triggering Event” will not be subject to covenant defeasance.

of Indenture” include our 6.00% Notes due 2056 (the “notes”), which are a series of our debt securities under the indenture. The following
description is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the indenture, which is incorporated by reference as
an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part. You should read the indenture for a complete statement of the
provisions described under this caption and

12

for other provisions that may be important to you. The indenture is subject to and governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
In  the  following  description,  we  have  included  references  to  some  of  the  section  numbers  of  the  base  indenture  and  the  supplemental
indenture so that you can easily locate those provisions.

General

The terms of each series of debt securities will be established by or pursuant to a resolution of our board of directors or a committee
thereof,  and  set  forth  or  determined  in  the  manner  provided  in  a  resolution  of  our  board  of  directors  or  a  committee  thereof,  an  officers’
certificate or a supplemental indenture. (Section 2.2 of the base indenture)

An unlimited aggregate principal amount of debt securities may be issued under the indenture. We may issue debt securities under the
indenture from time to time in one or more series with the same or various maturities, interest rates, public offering prices and other terms and
provisions. We need not issue all debt securities of one series at the same time. In addition, unless otherwise provided with respect to any
series of debt securities, we may, without the consent of the holders or beneficial owners of the debt securities of any series, reopen a series of
debt securities and issue additional debt securities of that series from time to time. Any such additional debt securities of any series, together
with the debt securities of that series previously issued, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the terms of the debt securities of any series may modify, supplement or supersede any of the

terms of the indenture described under this caption.

Transfer and Exchange

Debt securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange at any office we maintain for this purpose in accordance
with the terms of the indenture. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of debt securities (except as otherwise expressly
provided  by  the  indenture),  but  we  may  (subject  to  limited  exceptions)  require  payment  of  a  sum  sufficient  to  cover  any  tax  or  other
governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange. (Section 2.7 of the base indenture)

The indenture provides that neither we nor any registrar for the debt securities will be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange debt securities of any series during the period beginning at the opening of business 15 days preceding the mailing of a notice of
redemption of debt securities of that series and ending at the close of business on the day of that mailing or (b) to register the transfer of or
exchange debt securities (or portions thereof) selected, called or being called for redemption or, if applicable, surrendered for repurchase by
us at the option of the holder, except any portion thereof not so selected, called or being called or so surrendered. (Section 2.7 of the base
indenture)

The indenture provides that, prior to due presentment of a debt security for registration of transfer, we, the trustee and any agent of
ours or the trustee may treat the person in whose name such debt security is registered in the register maintained for that purpose as the owner
of such debt security for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal of and premium and interest, if any, on such debt security and for
all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payment with respect to such debt security shall be overdue, and neither we, the trustee nor
any agent of ours or the trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (Section 2.16 of the base indenture)

Covenants

The following covenants apply to the notes. The following covenants also apply to the debt securities of each other series that may be
outstanding  from  time  to  time  under  the  indenture,  unless  otherwise  specified  in  a  resolution  of  our  board  of  directors  (or  a  committee
thereof), supplemental indenture or officers’ certificate establishing the terms of the debt securities of such series as provided in the indenture.

Limitation on Liens

Subsidiary or intercompany Debt owed by any Significant Subsidiary to us or any of our other Subsidiaries (“Intercompany Debt”) (whether
such Principal Property, shares of Capital Stock or Intercompany Debt is existing or owed on the date the debt securities of such series are
first issued or thereafter created or acquired), without in any such case effectively providing, substantially concurrently with or prior to the
issuance, incurrence, creation, assumption or guarantee of any such secured Debt or the grant of such Lien securing any such secured Debt,
that the debt securities of such series (together with, if we shall so determine, any other indebtedness or other obligations (including, without
limitation, debt securities of other series issued under the indenture) of or guarantees by us or any Significant Subsidiary ranking equally in
right of payment with the debt securities of such series or any such guarantee) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at our option,
prior to) such secured Debt (but only so long as such secured Debt is so secured). The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any of
the following:

(1)        Liens  on  property,  Capital  Stock,  Debt  or  other  assets  of  any  person  existing  at  the  time  such  person  becomes  a
Subsidiary of ours, provided that such Liens are not incurred in anticipation of such person becoming a Subsidiary of ours and do not
extend to any assets other than those of such person;

(2)        Liens  on  property,  Capital  Stock,  Debt  or  other  assets  existing  at  the  time  of  acquisition  thereof  (including,  without

payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or Liens on property, Capital Stock, Debt or other assets to secure any Debt
incurred  prior  to,  at  the  time  of,  or  within  18  months  after,  the  latest  of  the  acquisition  (including,  without  limitation,  by  merger,
consolidation or acquisition of Capital Stock) thereof or, in the case of property, the completion of construction, the completion of
improvements or the commencement of substantial commercial operation of such property for the purpose of financing all or any part
of the purchase price thereof, such construction or the making of such improvements, as the case may be;

properties of any person as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to us or a Subsidiary of ours, provided that such Liens were not
incurred

14

in anticipation of such merger, consolidation, sale, lease or other disposition and do not extend to any assets other than those of the
person merged with or into, or consolidated with, us or a Subsidiary of ours or such property sold, leased or disposed of;

(10)    extensions, renewals, refinancings or replacements (in whole or in part) of any Liens or Debt which is secured by Liens
that were permitted to be incurred by the indenture; provided, however, that (a) the principal or accreted amount of any Debt of ours
or any of our Significant Subsidiaries secured by such Lien immediately after such extension, renewal, refinancing or replacement
shall  not  exceed  the  sum  of  the  principal  or  accreted  amount,  as  the  case  may  be,  of  any  Debt  of  ours  or  any  of  our  Significant

be subject to the restrictions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph if, immediately after giving effect thereto and, if applicable, to
the application of any proceeds therefrom to repay Debt on a pro forma basis, our Aggregate Debt does not exceed the greater of (1) 20% of
our  Consolidated  Net  Tangible  Assets,  determined  as  of  the  date  of  such  issuance,  incurrence,  creation,  assumption  or  guarantee,  and
(2) $500 million. (Section 4.1 of the supplemental indenture)

secured  by  a  Lien  on  the  Principal  Property  involved  in  such  Sale  and  Lease-Back  Transaction  at  least  equal  in  amount  to  the
Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, without equally and ratably securing the debt securities of
such series, pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Liens” above;

(4)    we or any of our Subsidiaries applies an amount equal to the net proceeds of such Sale and Lease-Back Transaction

obligations and covenants under the debt securities and the indenture. (Section 5.1 of the base indenture)

securities of such series were first issued and secured by Liens not permitted under the first paragraph under “—Limitation on
Liens” above, and

the  aggregate  amount  of  Attributable  Debt  of  us  and  our  Significant  Subsidiaries  then  outstanding  in  respect  of  Sale  and
Lease-Back Transactions entered into by us and our Significant Subsidiaries after the date the debt securities of such series
were first issued pursuant to the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions” above.

debt  securities  then  outstanding  under  the  indenture)  compounded  semi-annually  (assuming  a  360-day  year  consisting  of
twelve 30 day months). For purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that (a) the total net amount of rent required to be

maintenance, repairs, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates or similar charges or any amounts required to be paid by such
lessee contingent upon the amount of sales or similar contingent amounts. In the case of any lease that is terminable by the
lessee  upon  the  payment  of  a  penalty,  such  total  net  amount  of  rent  shall  be  the  lesser  of  (1)  the  net  amount  determined
assuming

17

termination  upon  the  first  date  such  lease  may  be  terminated  (in  which  case  the  net  amount  shall  also  include  the  present
value, calculated as provided above, of the amount of the penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under
such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or (2) the net amount determined assuming no

liabilities,  except  for  current  maturities  of  long-term  debt  and  obligations  under  capital  leases,  and  (b)  all  intangible  assets  (including
goodwill), to the extent included in said aggregate amount of assets, all as set forth in the most recent consolidated balance sheet of us and
our  consolidated  Subsidiaries  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP  contained  in  an  annual  report  on  Form  10‑K  or  a  quarterly  report  on
Form 10-Q (in each case as amended, if applicable) filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor thereto) or if,
at such date, we shall have ceased filing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor thereto), our then most

directors (or a committee thereof), supplemental indenture or officers’ certificate establishing the terms of the debt securities of such series as
provided in the indenture, any of the following:

•

•

•

•

•

default in the payment of any interest on any debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of
that default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of such payment is deposited by us with the trustee or with a

a series of debt securities other than that series), which default or breach continues uncured for a period of 90 days after there
has been given, by registered or certified mail, to us by the trustee or to us and the trustee by the holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series, a written notice containing the statements required by the
indenture; or

certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of eBay; or

any  other  event  of  default  with  respect  to  the  debt  securities  of  that  series  that  is  specified  in  a  resolution  of  our  board  of
directors (or a committee thereof), supplemental indenture

19

or officer’s certificate establishing the terms of the debt securities of that series as provided in the indenture. (Section 6.1 of
the base indenture)

No event of default with respect to a particular series of debt securities necessarily constitutes an event of default with respect to any
other series of debt securities. The occurrence of certain events of default or an acceleration of the debt securities of one or more series under
the indenture may constitute an event of default under certain of our other indebtedness outstanding from time to time.

If an event of default with respect to the debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing (other than an
event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of eBay), then the trustee or the holders of not less than
25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on all of the debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to us (and to the trustee if given by the
holders). If an event of default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of eBay occurs and is continuing
with respect to the debt securities of any series, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding debt securities of
such series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of
debt securities of such series. At any time after acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has occurred and before a judgment
or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
debt securities of that series may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences if all events of default with respect to the debt
securities of such series, other than non-payment of the principal and interest, if any, of the debt securities of such series which have become
due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. (Section 6.2 of the base indenture).

The indenture provides that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the
request  or  direction  of  any  of  the  holders  of  debt  securities  of  any  series  unless  such  holders  shall  have  offered  to  the  trustee  security  or
indemnity  reasonably  satisfactory  to  it  against  the  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  which  might  be  incurred  by  it  in  compliance  with  such
request or direction. (Section 7.2(f) of the base indenture) Subject to certain rights of the trustee and to certain conditions specified in the
indenture, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of  conducting any  proceeding  for  any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series. (Section 6.12 of the base indenture)

No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
indenture or the debt securities of such series, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee or similar official, or for any other remedy under
the indenture, unless:

•

•

•

that holder has previously given written notice to the trustee of a continuing event of default with respect to debt securities of
that series;

the  holders  of  at  least  a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the  outstanding  debt  securities  of  that  series  have  made  written
request  to  the  trustee  to  institute  proceedings  in  respect  of  such  event  of  default  in  its  own  name  as  trustee  under  the
indenture;

such  holder  or  holders  have  offered  to  the  trustee  indemnity  reasonably  satisfactory  to  it  against  the  costs,  expenses  and
liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

20

•

•

the  trustee  for  90  days  after  its  receipt  of  such  notice,  request  and  offer  of  indemnity  has  failed  to  institute  any  such
proceeding; and

no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 90-day period by holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series. (Section 6.7 of the base indenture)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the
principal of and premium and interest, if any, on that debt security on the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment. (Section 6.8 of the base indenture)

The indenture requires that we deliver to the trustee, within 120 days after the end of each of our fiscal years, an officers’ certificate
stating  whether  or  not,  to  the  knowledge  of  the  signers  thereof,  we  are  in  default  in  the  performance  or  observance  of  any  of  the  terms,
provisions and conditions of the indenture and, if we are in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which the
signers  may  have  knowledge.  The  indenture  also  requires  that,  so  long  as  any  debt  securities  are  outstanding,  we  deliver  to  the  trustee
promptly upon becoming aware of any default or event of default under the indenture, an officers’ certificate specifying such default or event
of default and what action we are taking or propose to take with respect thereto. (Section 4.3 of the base indenture) The indenture provides
that  the  trustee  may  withhold  notice  to  the  holders  of  debt  securities  of  any  series  of  any  default  or  event  of  default  with  respect  to  debt
securities of that series (except a default in payment of principal of or premium or interest, if any, on any debt securities of that series) if it in
good faith determines that withholding notice  is in  the  interest of  the  holders of  the debt securities  of that series. (Section 7.5 of the base
indenture)

We  and  the  trustee  may  enter  into  supplemental  indentures  for  the  purpose  of  supplementing  or  amending  in  any  manner  the
indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series or supplementing or amending the debt securities of any series with the consent of

immediately preceding paragraph. In that case then, anything in the indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the amendment, supplement or
waiver shall bind every holder of a debt security who has consented to it and every subsequent holder of a debt security or portion of a debt
security that evidences the same debt as the consenting holder’s debt security. (Section 9.5 of the base indenture)

any, on the outstanding debt securities of such series when due; and

a  limited  number  of  other  provisions  of  the  indenture,  including  provisions  relating  to  transfers  and  exchanges  of,  and  the
maintenance  of  a  registrar  and  paying  agent  for,  the  debt  securities  of  such  series  and  the  replacement  of  stolen,  lost  or
mutilated debt securities of such series.

We  sometimes  refer  to  this  as  “legal  defeasance.”  Upon  the  legal  defeasance  of  the  debt  securities  of  any  series,  we  will  be
discharged from our obligations to make payments on the debt securities of such series and (subject to the exceptions as described above) all
of our other obligations under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of such series.

The  indenture  further  provides  that,  upon  satisfaction  of  the  conditions  specified  in  the  indenture,  we  will  be  released  from  our
obligations  under,  and  may  omit  to  comply  with,  the  covenants  described  under  the  heading  “—Covenants”  above  and  certain  other
covenants in the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series, as well as any additional covenants applicable to the debt securities
of such series which may be identified in a resolution of our board of directors (or committee thereof), supplemental indenture or officers’
certificate establishing the terms of the debt securities of such series as provided in the indenture as being subject to covenant defeasance, and
the failure to comply with any such covenants shall not constitute a default or event of default with respect to any debt securities of such
series. We sometimes refer to this as “covenant defeasance.”

Conditions to Legal  Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. In  order to effect legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the debt

securities of any series, we must, among other things:

(a)

(b)

deposit with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities of any series denominated
in a currency other than U.S. dollars, money and/or foreign government obligations, that, through the payment of interest and
principal in accordance with their terms, will provide an amount in cash sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest, if any, on
and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the dates those payments are due
or, if applicable, any redemption date;

in the case of legal defeasance, deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that we have received from, or there
has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of the indenture, there has been a
change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion
shall confirm that, the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, legal defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States
federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit, legal defeasance and discharge had not occurred; and

(c)

in  the  case  of  covenant  defeasance,  deliver  to  the  trustee  an  opinion  of  counsel  to  the  effect  that  the  holders  of  the  debt
securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and covenant

24

defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and covenant defeasance had not occurred. (Sections 8.3 and 8.4 of
the base indenture)

In the event we exercise our option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of debt securities and the debt securities
of that series are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an event of default (including an event of default due to our failure to
comply  with  any  covenant  that  remains  in  effect  following  such  covenant  defeasance),  the  amount  of  money  and/or  U.S.  government
obligations or foreign government obligations, as the case may be, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the
debt securities of that series on the dates those payments are due or, if applicable, a redemption date, but may not be sufficient to pay amounts
due on the debt securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from the event of default. However, we shall remain liable for
those payments.

When we use the term “U.S. government obligations,” we mean:

•

•

securities which are (a) direct obligations of the United States of America for the payment of which its full faith and credit is
pledged or (b) obligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States  of  America,  the  payment  of  which  is  unconditionally  guaranteed  as  a  full  faith  and  credit  obligation  by  the  United
States of America, and which in the case of (a) and (b) are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof; and

depository receipts issued by a bank or trust company as custodian with respect to any such U.S. government obligations or a
specific payment of interest on, or principal of or other amount payable with respect to, such U.S. government obligations
held by such custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt, provided that (except as required by law) such
custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any
amount  received  by  the  custodian  in  respect  of  the  U.S.  government  obligation  or  the  specific  payment  of  interest  on  or
principal of or other amount payable with respect to the U.S. government obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.

Satisfaction and Discharge

The indenture will cease to be of any further effect with respect to any series of debt securities if:

•

•

all outstanding debt securities of such series have (subject to certain exceptions) been delivered to the trustee for cancellation;
or

all  outstanding  debt  securities  of  such  series  not  previously  delivered  to  the  trustee  for  cancellation  have  become  due  and
payable, will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, have been called for redemption or are to be
called  for  redemption  within  one  year,  or  have  been  legally  defeased  as  described  above  under  “—Defeasance  of  Debt
Securities  and  Certain  Covenants,”  and  (except  in  the  case  of  debt  securities  that  have  been  legally  defeased)  we  have
deposited  with  the  trustee  an  amount  sufficient  to  pay  the  principal  of,  and  premium  and  interest,  if  any,  on,  such  debt
securities to the date of such deposit (in the case of debt securities which have become due and payable on or prior to the date
of such deposit) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;

25

and, in either case, we also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable under the indenture by us with respect to the debt securities of that
series and satisfy certain other conditions specified in the indenture. We sometime refer to this as “satisfaction and discharge.” (Section 8.1 of
the base indenture)

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series, a limited number of
provisions  of  the  indenture  shall  remain  in  effect,  including  provisions  relating  to  transfers  and  exchanges  of,  and  the  maintenance  of  a
registrar and paying agent for, debt securities, and the replacement of stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities.

Repayment of Unclaimed Funds

The indenture provides that the trustee and any paying agent shall pay to us upon request any money, U.S. government obligations or
foreign government obligations held by them for payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, or any sinking fund payment on any debt
securities that remain unclaimed for two years after the respective dates such principal, interest or premium, if any, or sinking fund payment
shall have become due and payable. Thereafter, holders of debt securities entitled to those payments must look to us for payment as general
creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. (Section 8.5 of the base indenture)

Governing Law

The indenture and the debt securities will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

No Recourse Against Others

The indenture provides that a director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of ours shall not have any liability for any of our
obligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.
The indenture further provides that each holder of debt securities, by accepting a debt security, waives and releases all such liability and that
such waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the debt securities.

Book-Entry Form and Transfer

The debt securities of any series may be issued in the form of one or more debt securities in global, fully registered form (“global
securities”), without interest coupons. Each such global security will be deposited with or on behalf of a depositary for the global securities of
such series (the “Depositary”) and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary. The following discussion assumes
that The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will be the Depositary.

Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through the Depositary if they are direct participants (as defined below)

or indirectly through organizations that are participants (as defined below) in the Depositary. Except in the limited circumstances described
below, holders of beneficial interests in the global securities of any series will not be entitled to receive debt securities of such series in
definitive, certificated form (“certificated securities”) or to have debt securities of such series registered in their names.

The Depositary holds securities of institutions that have accounts with the Depositary (“direct participants”) to facilitate the clearance

and settlement of securities transactions among its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants,
thereby eliminating the need for

26

physical movement of securities certificates. The Depositary’s direct participants include brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to the Depositary’s book-entry system is also available to other organizations
(“indirect participants” and, together with direct participants, “participants”), such as brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing
corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, whether directly or indirectly. The rules
applicable to the Depositary and its direct participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of a global security of any series, the Depositary or such nominee, as
the case may be, will be considered the sole holder and owner of the debt securities represented by such global security for all purposes under
the indenture and such debt securities. Owners of beneficial interests in a global security of any series will not be considered the owners or
holders of the debt securities of such series under the indenture, will not be able to transfer those beneficial interests except in accordance
with the procedures of the Depositary and its participants and, except under the limited circumstances set forth below, will not be entitled to
receive certificated securities or to have debt securities registered in their names. Accordingly, each owner of a beneficial interest in a global
security of any series must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such person is not a direct participant, on the procedures of the
participants through which it owns its beneficial interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities of such series under the indenture.
We understand that, under existing industry practice, in the event owners of beneficial interests in global securities of any series wish to take
any  action  that  DTC  or  its  nominee,  as  the  holder  of  such  global  securities,  is  entitled  to  take,  DTC  would  authorize  the  applicable
participants to take such action, and that such participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such
action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such beneficial owners. Because DTC can only act on behalf of direct participants, who
in turn act on behalf of others, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do
not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest, may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate
representing that interest.

All  payments  on  the  debt  securities  of  any  series  represented  by  a  global  security  registered  in  the  name  of  the  Depositary  or  its
nominee will be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered holder of the global security. We expect that the
Depositary or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, or premium or interest, if any, on, a global security of any series, will
credit  the  applicable  direct  participants’  accounts  with  payments  in  amounts  proportionate  to  their  respective  beneficial  interests  in  the
principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of the Depositary. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of
beneficial interests in the global security held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as
is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in “street name”; those payments will be the responsibility of such
participants.  Neither  we,  the  trustee  nor  any  agent  of  ours  or  of  the  trustee  will  have  any  responsibility  or  liability  for  any  aspect  of  the
records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial interests in any global security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
any records relating to such beneficial interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between the Depositary and its participants or the
relationship between such participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the global securities.

Unless  and  until  it  is  exchanged  in  whole  or  in  part  for  certificated  securities  under  the  limited  circumstances  described  below,  a
global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary
to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of
such successor Depositary.

27

The indenture provides that the global securities of any series will be exchanged for debt securities of the same series in certificated

form only in the following limited circumstances:

(1)    we receive notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the global securities of
such series or if the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), and, in either case, we fail to appoint a successor Depositary for the global securities of such series registered as
clearing agency under the Exchange Act within 90 days after the date we receive such notice or learn that the Depositary has ceased
to be so registered;

(2)    we in our sole discretion determine that the global securities of such series shall be exchanged (in whole but not in part)

for debt securities of such series in certificated form and we deliver to the trustee an officers’ certificate to such effect; or

(3)    an event of default with respect to the debt securities of such series shall have occurred and shall be continuing.

Any  global  security  of  any  series  that  is  exchanged  for  certificated  securities  as  provided  above  will  be  exchanged  for  an  equal
aggregate  principal  amount  of  certificated  securities  of  the  same  series,  in  authorized  denominations  and  registered  in  such  names  as  the
Depositary  instructs  the  trustee.  It  is  expected  that  such  instructions  will  be  based  upon  directions  received  by  the  Depositary  from
participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.

The  information  in  this  section  concerning  DTC  and  its  book-entry  system  has  been  obtained  from  sources  that  we  believe  to  be
reliable, but we do not take responsibility for this information. This information has been provided solely as a matter of convenience. The
rules and procedures of DTC are solely within its control and could change at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor any agent of ours or of
the trustee has any control over DTC and none of us takes any responsibility for their activities. In addition, DTC is under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee nor any
agent  of  ours  or  of  the  trustee  has  any  responsibility  for  the  performance  or  nonperformance  by  DTC  or  any  other  Depositary  or  their
respective participants of these or any other rules or procedures governing their respective operations.

CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002.

Exhibit 31.01

4.

I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of eBay Inc.;

Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
report;

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f)) for the registrant and have:

a)

b)

c)

d)

Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
