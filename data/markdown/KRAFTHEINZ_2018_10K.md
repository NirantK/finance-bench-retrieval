statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues; our ability to protect intellectual property
rights;  tax  law  changes  or  interpretations;  the  impact  of  future  sales  of  our  common  stock  in  the  public  markets;  our  ability  to  continue  to  pay  a  regular

General

Explanatory Note

On  May  2,  2019,  management,  in  consultation  with  the  Audit  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors,  concluded  that  our  audited  consolidated  financial
statements and related disclosures for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and
each of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods in fiscal year 2017 and each of our unaudited
condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  quarterly  and  year-to-date  periods  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  29,  2018  included  in  our
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018,
March 31, 2018, and September 30, 2017) and Form 10-Q/A (unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended July 1,
2017  and  April  1,  2017)  should  no  longer  be  relied  upon  due  to  misstatements  that  are  described  in  greater  detail  below,  and  that  we  would  restate  such
financial  statements  to  make  the  necessary  accounting  corrections.  We  discussed  this  conclusion  with  our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

Restatement

This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  29,  2018  includes  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  at  December  29,  2018  and
December 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, as well as relevant unaudited interim financial
information for the quarterly periods ended December 29, 2018, September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, September 30,
2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017. We have restated certain information within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial
statements  at  December  30,  2017  and  for  the  years  ended  December  30,  2017  and  December  31,  2016,  selected  financial  data  at  and  for  the  year  ended
January 3, 2016, and the relevant unaudited interim financial information for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018,
December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 (collectively known as the “Financial Statements”).

Restatement Background

As described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 6, 2019, management noted certain
misstatements  contained  in  the  Financial  Statements  relating  principally  to  the  accounting  treatment  for  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements.  As
previously disclosed, we received a subpoena from the SEC in October 2018related to our procurement area, specifically the accounting policies, procedures,
and  internal  controls  related  to  our  procurement  function,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  agreements,  side  agreements,  and  changes  or  modifications  to
agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with external counsel and forensic accountants, and subsequently, under
the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”), conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and
related  matters.  As  a  result  of  the  findings  from  this  internal  investigation,  which  is  now  complete  and  which  identified  that  multiple  employees  in  the
procurement area engaged in misconduct, we corrected prior period misstatements that generally increased the total cost of products sold in prior financial
periods. These misstatements principally related to the incorrect timing of when certain cost and rebate elements associated with supplier contracts and related
arrangements  were  initially  recognized.  The  findings  from  the  internal  investigation  did  not  identify  any  misconduct  by  any  member  of  the  senior
management team. We continue to cooperate with the SEC concerning its investigation of these matters.

In  connection  with  the  internal  investigation,  we  also  conducted  a  comprehensive  review  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements  to  identify  other
potential  misstatements  in  the  timing  of  the  recognition  of  supplier  rebates,  incentive  payments,  and  pricing  arrangements.  The  review  identified  further
misstatements, which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. These misstatements were
primarily related to certain supplier contracts and related arrangements where the allocation of value of all or a portion of rebates and up-front payments to
contractual elements in the current period should have been deferred and recognized over an applicable contractual period. We corrected these misstatements
to  defer  the  up-front  consideration  from  suppliers  when  the  retention  or  receipt  of  that  consideration  was  contingent  upon  future  events  and  to  correctly
recognize the consideration as a reduction of cost of products sold over the terms of the arrangements with the suppliers.

4

Our internal investigation and review identified adjustments that resulted in an understatement of cost of products sold totaling $208 million, including $175
million  relating  to  the  periods  up  through  September  29,  2018  that  are  being  restated  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  The  misstatements  of  cost  of
products sold related to our internal investigation and review included $22 million for fiscal year 2018, $94 million for fiscal year 2017, $35 million for fiscal
year 2016, and $24 million for fiscal year 2015. We  do  not  believe  that  the  misstatements  are  quantitatively  material  to  any  period  presented  in  our  prior
financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number of years over which
the  misconduct  occurred  and  the  number  of  transactions,  suppliers,  and  procurement  employees  involved,  we  determined  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to
correct  the  misstatements  in  our  previously  issued  consolidated  financial  statements  by  restating  such  financial  statements.  The  restatement  also  included
corrections  for  additional  identified  out-of-period  and  uncorrected  misstatements  in  the  impacted  periods.  Accordingly,  we  have  restated  our  consolidated
financial statements and the impacted amounts within the accompanying footnotes thereto.

In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of accounting standards
update (“ASU”) 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter
of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The
restated statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2017-07 and are labeled “As Recast.”

Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements

This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  restates  amounts  included  in  the  2017  Annual  Report  described  above,  including  the  audited  consolidated  financial
statements at December 30, 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In addition to the misstatements related to the
supplier contracts and related arrangements, including the misstatements related to lease classification, we corrected additional identified out-of-period and
uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements were related
to customer incentive program expense misclassifications, balance sheet misclassifications, income taxes, impairments, and other misstatements.

See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  for  additional
information.

The  relevant  unaudited  interim  financial  information  for  the  quarterly  periods  ended  September  29,  2018,  June  30,  2018,  March  31,  2018,  December  30,
2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017, has also been restated. The 2018 quarterly restatements will be effective with the filing of our
future 2019 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement filings in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

See Note 23, Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited), in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for such restated information, and see
Supplemental  Unaudited  Quarterly  Financial  Information,  in  Item  7,  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
Operations, for additional interim financial information.

Selected financial information for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 has also been restated. See Item 6, Selected Financial Data.

Control Considerations

In  connection  with  the  restatement,  management  has  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Based  on  this  assessment,
management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting resulting in the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  not  effective  as  of  December  29,  2018.  Management  has  taken  and  is  taking
additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, for additional
information related to these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and the related remedial measures.

Additional Information Specific to Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment

We announced on February 21, 2019 that as part of our normal quarterly reporting procedures and planning processes for the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair
values of certain goodwill and intangible assets were below their carrying amounts. As a result, we announced non-cash impairment losses of $15.4 billion to
lower the carrying amount of goodwill in certain reporting units, primarily U.S. Refrigerated and Canada Retail, and certain intangible assets, primarily the
Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6, 2019, we subsequently identified errors in the
calculations  performed  in  connection  with  the  interim  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  impairment  testing  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018.
Specifically, we identified certain errors in projected net cash flows and allocations to certain brands. Correcting this allocation error resulted in an increase to
the impairment losses initially calculated for brands of approximately $278 million, partially offset by a reduction to the impairment losses initially calculated
for reporting units of approximately $171 million.

In addition, the corrections to the carrying values on our balance sheet at December 29, 2018 recorded as part of the correction of the procurement-related
misstatements described above resulted in an adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain reporting units, and therefore resulted in a reduction to goodwill
impairment losses of approximately $92 million. The net impact of these misstatements was an increase of approximately $15 million from the $15.4 billion
total impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 previously announced in our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019.

As discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the
level  of  precision  used  to  review  the  allocation  of  cash  flow  projections  to  certain  brands  used  as  a  basis  for  performing  our  fourth  quarter  2018  interim
impairment  assessments  in  response  to  the  significant  reduction  in,  and  in  certain  instances  elimination  of,  the  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  for
certain brands that resulted from the changing business environment. This material weakness resulted in the errors in the calculations performed in connection
with the interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018, as described above, because approximately
five to ten percent of cash flows were not subjected to our control procedures. This material weakness arose during our interim impairment testing in the
fourth  quarter  of  2018  due  to  the  significant  reduction  in  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  for  certain  brands  as  noted  above,  which  required  us  to
increase the percentage of cash flows subject to our control procedures to nearly one hundred percent. This did not result in a misstatement of any previously
reported consolidated financial statements but was determined to be a material weakness because it could have resulted in a material misstatement that would
not have been prevented or detected.

Item 1. Business.

PART I

General
For 150 years, we have produced some of the world’s most beloved products at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC). Our Vision is To Be the Best Food
Company, Growing a Better World. We are one of the largest global food and beverage companies, with 2018 net sales of approximately $26 billion.  Our
portfolio is a diverse mix of iconic and emerging brands. As the guardians of these brands and the creators of innovative new products, we are dedicated to
the sustainable health of our people and our planet.

On July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary
of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company, and H.
J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company.

Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire Hathaway”) and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P.
(“3G Capital”) (together, the “Sponsors”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.

Reportable Segments

We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two
operating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).

Our  segments  reflect  a  change,  effective  in  the  first  quarter  of  our  fiscal  year  2018,  to  reorganize  our  international  businesses  to  better  align  our  global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment into
the historical Europe reportable segment, forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became
the APAC operating segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented.

See Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for our geographic financial information by segment.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property

Our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets. Depending on the country, trademarks generally remain valid for as long
as  they  are  in  use  or  their  registration  status  is  maintained.  Trademark  registrations  generally  are  for  renewable,  fixed  terms.  Significant  trademarks  by
segment based on net sales in 2018 were:

United States

  Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Lunchables, Velveeta, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun*, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O

Majority Owned and Licensed Trademarks

Canada

EMEA

  Kraft, Cracker Barrel, Heinz, Philadelphia, Maxwell House, Classico, McCafe*, P’Tit Quebec, Tassimo*

  Heinz, Plasmon, Pudliszki, Honig, HP, Kraft, Benedicta, Karvan Cevitam

Rest of World

  Heinz, ABC, Master, Quero, Kraft, Golden Circle, Wattie's, Glucon-D, Complan
*Used under license. Additionally, our license to use the McCafe brand in Canada will expire in December 2019.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations, predominantly in Canada and India, including the intellectual
property rights to Cracker Barrel and P’Tit Quebec in Canada, as well as Glucon-D and Complan globally. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on these transactions.

We sell certain products under brands we license from third parties. In 2018, brands used under licenses from third parties included Capri Sun packaged drink
pouches for sale in the United States, TGI Fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the United States and Canada, McCafe ground, whole bean, and on-demand
single cup coffees in the United States and Canada, and Taco Bell Home Originals Mexican-style food products in U.S. grocery stores. In addition, in our
agreements  with  Mondelēz  International,  Inc.  (“Mondelēz  International”)  following  the  spin-off  of  Kraft  from  Mondelēz  International  in  2012,  we  each
granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time.

We also own numerous patents worldwide. We consider our portfolio of patents, patent applications, patent licenses under patents owned by third parties,
proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations. Patents, issued or applied
for, cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. While our patent portfolio
is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our  issued  patents  extend  for  varying  periods  according  to  the  date  of  the  patent  application  filing  or  grant  and  the  legal  term  of  patents  in  the  various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

Research and Development

Our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:

•

•

•

•

product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth;

world-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;

superior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and

continuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions.

Competition

Our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers,
large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional
companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product
quality and innovation, brand recognition and loyalty, service, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, the introduction of new products and
the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, distribution, shelf space, merchandising support, and price. Improving our market
position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.

Sales and Customers

Our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers, agents, and distributors to chain, wholesale, cooperative and
independent grocery accounts, convenience stores, drug stores, value stores, bakeries, pharmacies, mass merchants, club stores, foodservice distributors, and
institutions, including hotels, restaurants, hospitals, health care facilities, and certain government agencies. Our products are also sold online through various
e-commerce platforms and retailers. Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2018, approximately 21% of our
net sales in 2017, and approximately 22% of our net sales in 2016.

Additionally,  we  have  significant  customers  in  different  regions  around  the  world;  however,  none  of  these  customers  are  individually  material  to  our
consolidated business. In 2018, the five largest customers in our U.S. segment accounted for approximately 49% of U.S. segment net sales, the five largest
customers  in  our  Canada  segment  accounted  for  approximately  71%  of  Canada  segment  net  sales,  and  the  five  largest  customers  in  our  EMEA  segment
accounted for approximately 26% of our EMEA segment net sales.

Net Sales by Product Category

In 2018, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change for all historical
periods presented. The product categories that contributed 10% or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were:

Condiments and sauces

Cheese and dairy

Ambient foods

Frozen and chilled foods

Meats and seafood

Raw Materials and Packaging

We  manufacture  (and  contract  for  the  manufacture  of)  our  products  from  a  wide  variety  of  raw  materials.  We  purchase  and  use  large  quantities  of
commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn
products, and wheat products, to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, and cardboard to package
our  products  and  natural  gas  to  operate  our  facilities.  For  commodities  that  we  use  across  many  of  our  product  categories,  such  as  corrugated  paper  and
energy, we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition, some of our product lines and brands separately
source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers, including large, international producers
and  smaller,  local,  independent  sellers.  Where  appropriate,  we  seek  to  establish  preferred  purchaser  status  and  have  developed  strategic  partnerships  with
many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and
agricultural  materials  that  we  use  in  our  products  are  affected  by  external  factors,  such  as  global  competition  for  resources,  currency  fluctuations,  severe
weather or global climate change, consumer, industrial or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative energy,
and agricultural programs.

Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices.
Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and
that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many
of our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw material costs. We actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other
operational measures.

Seasonality and Working Capital

Although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis, the majority of our products are produced throughout the
year.

Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products, including holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. While these factors
influence our quarterly net sales, operating income/(loss), and cash flows at the product level, unless the timing of such events shift period-over-period (e.g., a
shift in Easter timing), this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results.

For information related to our cash flows provided by/(used for) operating activities, including working capital items, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.

Employees

We had approximately 38,000 employees as of December 29, 2018.

Regulation

The  manufacture  and  sale  of  consumer  food  and  beverage  products  is  highly  regulated.  Our  business  operations,  including  the  production,  transportation,
storage,  distribution,  sale,  display,  advertising,  marketing,  labeling,  quality  and  safety  of  our  products  and  their  ingredients,  and  our  occupational  safety,
health, and privacy practices, are subject to various laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by federal, state, and local government
agencies  in  the  United  States,  as  well  as  government  entities  and  agencies  outside  the  United  States  in  markets  where  our  products  are  manufactured,
distributed  or  sold.  In  the  United  States,  our  activities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  various  federal  government  agencies,  including  the  Food  and  Drug
Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection
Agency,  as  well  as  various  state  and  local  agencies.  We  are  also  subject  to  numerous  similar  and  other  laws  and  regulations  outside  of  the  United  States,
including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are
also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act,
and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house
and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business. In addition, the
United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and other regulatory regime changes may add cost
and complexity to our compliance efforts.

9

Environmental Regulation

Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters. Various laws concerning the
handling,  storage,  and  disposal  of  hazardous  materials  and  the  operation  of  facilities  in  environmentally  sensitive  locations  may  impact  aspects  of  our
operations.

In the United States, where a significant portion of our business operates, these laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act,  and  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability  Act  (“CERCLA”).  CERCLA
imposes  joint  and  several  liability  on  each  potentially  responsible  party.  We  are  involved  in  a  number  of  active  proceedings  in  the  United  States  under
CERCLA (and other similar state actions under similar legislation) related to our current operations and certain closed, inactive, or divested operations for
which we retain liability.

As of December 29, 2018, we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we
believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will
not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance
efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus, future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Industry Risks

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as
well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service,
taste,  convenience,  brand  recognition  and  loyalty,  effectiveness  of  marketing  and  distribution,  promotional  activity,  and  the  ability  to  identify  and  satisfy
changing consumer preferences.

We  may  need  to  reduce  our  prices  in  response  to  competitive  and  customer  pressures,  including  pressures  in  relation  to  private  label  products  that  are
generally  sold  at  lower  prices.  These  pressures  have  restricted  and  may  in  the  future  continue  to  restrict  our  ability  to  increase  prices  in  response  to
commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact
the achievement of our objectives.

11

The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships
and  presenting  additional  challenges  to  increasing  prices  in  response  to  commodity  or  other  cost  increases.  We  may  also  need  to  increase  or  reallocate
spending  on  marketing,  retail  trade  incentives,  materials,  advertising,  and  new  product  or  channel  innovation  to  maintain  or  increase  market  share.  These
expenditures  are  subject  to  risks,  including  uncertainties  about  trade  and  consumer  acceptance  of  our  efforts.  If  we  are  unable  to  compete  effectively,  our
profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.

Our success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to
meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.

Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the
tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences, including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not
offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.

We must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer
preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because
of  our  varied  consumer  base,  we  must  offer  an  array  of  products  that  satisfy  a  broad  spectrum  of  consumer  preferences.  If  we  fail  to  expand  our  product
offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories, demand for our
products could decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products (including as they relate to obesity or other health
concerns)  could  influence  consumer  preferences  and  acceptance  of  some  of  our  products  and  marketing  programs.  We  strive  to  respond  to  consumer
preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences
could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, achieving growth depends on our successful development, introduction, and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are
inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on
our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to
correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance, to obtain, protect, and maintain necessary intellectual property rights, and to avoid infringing upon
the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our
competitors, and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance.

Retail  customers,  such  as  supermarkets,  warehouse  clubs,  and  food  distributors  in  our  major  markets,  may  continue  to  consolidate,  resulting  in  fewer  but
larger customers for our business across various channels. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their positions to
improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency, lower pricing, more favorable terms, increased promotional programs, or specifically-tailored
product  offerings.  In  addition,  larger  retailers  have  scale  to  develop  supply  chains  that  permit  them  to  operate  with  reduced  inventories  or  to  develop  and
market their own private label products. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and operating results.

Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding
material  and  adverse  effect  on  us.  For  example,  if  our  customers  cannot  access  sufficient  funds  or  financing,  then  they  may  delay,  decrease,  or  cancel
purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results.

In addition, technology-based systems, which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, are also
significantly  altering  the  retail  landscape  in  many  of  our  markets.  If  we  are  unable  to  adjust  to  developments  in  these  changing  landscapes,  we  may  be
disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating
results.

12

Changes in our relationships with significant customers, suppliers, or other business relationships could adversely impact us.

We derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers (see Sales and Customers within Item 1, Business). There can be no assurance
that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as
increasingly  powerful  retailers  may  demand  lower  pricing  and  focus  on  developing  their  own  brands.  The  loss  of  a  significant  customer  or  a  material
reduction  in  sales  or  a  change  in  the  mix  of  products  we  sell  to  a  significant  customer  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  product  sales,  financial
condition, and operating results.

Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers
and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, terminations of relationships with other
significant contractual counterparties, including licensors, could adversely affect our portfolio, product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, the financial condition of such customers, suppliers, and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and
events that are beyond our control. Significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers, suppliers, and other business relationships
could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

Maintaining, extending, and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success.

We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our
existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.

We  seek  to  maintain,  extend,  and  expand  our  brand  image  through  marketing  investments,  including  advertising  and  consumer  promotions,  and  product
innovation.  Negative  perceptions  on  the  role  of  food  and  beverage  marketing  could  adversely  affect  our  brand  image  or  lead  to  stricter  regulations  and
scrutiny of marketing practices. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social
impacts,  our  products  becoming  unavailable  to  consumers,  or  our  suppliers  and,  in  some  cases,  our  competitors,  could  damage  our  reputation  and  brand
image, undermine our customers’ confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our
operations.  Furthermore,  existing  or  increased  legal  or  regulatory  restrictions  on  our  advertising,  consumer  promotions,  and  marketing,  or  our  response  to
those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands.

In addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment.
We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and
extent  that  information,  including  misinformation,  and  opinions  can  be  shared.  Negative  posts  or  comments  about  us,  our  brands  or  our  products,  or  our
suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition,
we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding
our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results
could be materially and adversely affected.

We must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products.

In nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our
products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may
not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products
or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product
mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster-growing and more
profitable categories.

Our  future  results  will  depend  on  our  ability  to  drive  revenue  growth  in  our  key  product  categories  and  growth  in  the  food  and  beverage  industry  in  the
countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster-growing
and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market
share  decreases  in  our  key  product  categories,  or  develop  innovative  products  for  new  and  existing  categories  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

13

Product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.

Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or
other adulteration. We have decided and could in the future decide to, and have been or could in the future be required to, recall products due to suspected or
confirmed product contamination, adulteration, product mislabeling or misbranding, tampering, undeclared allergens, or other deficiencies. Product recalls or
market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the
product for a period of time.

We  could  be  adversely  affected  if  consumers  lose  confidence  in  the  safety  and  quality  of  certain  food  products  or  ingredients,  or  the  food  safety  system
generally.  Adverse  attention  about  these  types  of  concerns,  whether  or  not  valid,  may  damage  our  reputation,  discourage  consumers  from  buying  our
products, or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition.

We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness, or death. In addition, our
marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory
enforcement action against us, or a significant product recall, may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product
liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit, or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.

We  have  a  complex  network  of  suppliers,  owned  and  leased  manufacturing  locations,  co-manufacturing  locations,  distribution  networks,  and  information
systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather,
raw material shortages, natural disasters, fires or explosions, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, could damage or disrupt
our operations or our suppliers’, co-manufacturers’ or distributors’ operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain
or  distribution  network.  If  we  cannot  respond  to  disruptions  in  our  operations,  whether  by  finding  alternative  suppliers  or  replacing  capacity  at  key
manufacturing or distribution locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in
delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our
customers’ confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition, and operating results.

Business Risks

We may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures, joint ventures, or other investments.

From  time  to  time,  we  have  evaluated  and  may  continue  to  evaluate  acquisition  candidates,  alliances,  joint  ventures,  or  other  investments  that  may
strategically fit our business objectives, and we have divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or
profitability  targets.  These  activities  may  present  financial,  managerial,  and  operational  risks  including,  but  not  limited  to,  diversion  of  management’s
attention  from  existing  core  businesses,  difficulties  integrating  or  separating  personnel  and  financial  and  other  systems,  inability  to  effectively  and
immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population, adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier
business relationships, and potential disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition
laws  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  the  European  Union,  and  other  jurisdictions,  and  we  may  be  required  to  obtain  the  approval  of  these  transactions  by
competition authorities, as well as to satisfy other legal requirements.

To the extent we undertake acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, investments, or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories, we may
face additional risks related to such developments. For example, risks related to foreign operations include compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations
outside of the United States, such as the FCPA, currency rate fluctuations, compliance with foreign regulations and laws, including tax laws, and exposure to
politically and economically volatile developing markets. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition,
and operating results.

14

We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and
improve our competitiveness.

We have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives, including our Integration Program (as defined in Overview, in Item 7, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We
have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure to enable us to reduce costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our
competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives. In addition, certain of our
initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion, outsourcing, or distribution costs. We must accurately
predict  costs  and  be  efficient  in  executing  any  plans  to  achieve  cost  savings  and  operate  efficiently  in  the  highly  competitive  food  and  beverage  industry,
particularly  in  an  environment  of  increased  competitive  activity.  To  capitalize  on  our  efforts,  we  must  carefully  evaluate  investments  in  our  business,  and
execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts, we could
be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness, production, profitability, financial conditions, and operating results could be adversely
affected.

We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives.

We  plan  to  continue  to  conduct  strategic  initiatives  in  various  markets.  Consumer  demands,  behaviors,  tastes  and  purchasing  trends  may  differ  in  these
markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may
also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Any
of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. We may also face difficulties divesting business operations with
minimal  impact  to  the  retained  businesses.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  successfully  complete  any  planned  strategic  initiatives,  that  any  new
business will be profitable or meet our expectations, or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption, which could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.

We are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 31% of our 2018 net sales
were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by
market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA;

changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
tax laws or their interpretations, or tax audit implications;

the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, or similar restrictions on our sales or imports, trade agreements, regulations, taxes,
or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs;

currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values;

compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national, and multi-national regulations and laws in
multiple jurisdictions;

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions;

changes  in  capital  controls,  including  currency  exchange  controls,  government  currency  policies,  or  other  limits  on  our  ability  to  import  raw
materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;

challenges associated with cross-border product distribution;

changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the
potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;

risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries
in which we operate;

the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application, and
enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;

risks  arising  from  the  significant  and  rapid  fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  markets  and  the  decisions  made  and  positions  taken  to  hedge  such
volatility;

changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations;

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and

15

•

design, implementation, and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption,
expropriation, and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. Slow economic
growth  or  high  unemployment  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate  could  constrain  consumer  spending,  and  declining  consumer  purchasing  power  could
adversely impact our profitability. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales, and could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations where we do business.

Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other
nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the legal and regulatory
effects  of  Brexit,  changes  to  major  international  trade  arrangements  (e.g.,  the  United  States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement),  and  the  imposition  of  tariffs  by
certain foreign governments, including China and Canada, in response to the imposition of tariffs or modification of trade relationships by the United States,
could  negatively  impact  our  operations  and  sales.  Other  factors  impacting  our  operations  in  the  United  States  and  in  international  locations  where  we  do
business include export and import restrictions, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, cash repatriation restrictions, recessionary conditions, foreign
ownership restrictions, nationalization, the impact of hyperinflationary environments, terrorist acts, and political unrest. Such factors in either domestic or
foreign jurisdictions, and our responses to them, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. For further
information on Venezuela, see Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

We  rely  on  our  management  team  and  other  key  personnel  and  may  be  unable  to  hire  or  retain  key  personnel  or  a  highly  skilled  and  diverse  global
workforce.

We depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability
to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within
and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented personnel and a diverse
global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business. Unplanned turnover, failure to attract and develop personnel
with  key  emerging  capabilities  such  as  e-commerce  and  digital  marketing  skills,  or  failure  to  develop  adequate  succession  plans  for  leadership  positions,
including the Chief Executive Officer position, could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Changes in immigration laws
and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. Any such loss, failure, or limitation could adversely affect our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results.

We  are  significantly  dependent  on  information  technology,  and  we  may  be  unable  to  protect  our  information  systems  against  service  interruption,
misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.

We  rely  on  information  technology  networks  and  systems,  including  the  Internet,  to  process,  transmit,  and  store  electronic  and  financial  information,  to
manage  a  variety  of  business  processes  and  activities,  and  to  comply  with  regulatory,  legal,  and  tax  requirements.  We  also  depend  on  our  information
technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers. These
information  technology  systems,  some  of  which  are  managed  by  third  parties,  may  be  susceptible  to  damage,  invasions,  disruptions,  or  shutdowns  due  to
hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors.
If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or
by  cyber-attacks,  and  our  business  continuity  plans  do  not  effectively  resolve  the  issues  in  a  timely  manner,  we  could  experience  business  disruptions,
reputational damage, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the leakage of confidential information, and the loss of customers and sales, causing our
product sales, financial condition, and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed.

In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation
or  remediation  costs,  fines,  or  penalties  because  of  the  unauthorized  disclosure  of  confidential  information  belonging  to  us  or  to  our  partners,  customers,
consumers, or suppliers.

16

Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of
opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts
and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated
confidential  information  belonging  to  us,  our  current  or  former  employees,  or  to  our  suppliers  or  consumers,  and  may  become  subject  to  legal  action  and
increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach
or to repair or replace networks and information systems.

Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers, distributors, or regulators operate.

We have been and may in the future be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or tsunamis that
could  disrupt  our  operations  or  the  operations  of  our  customers,  suppliers,  distributors,  or  regulators.  Natural  disasters  or  other  disruptions  at  any  of  our
facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of
our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse
effects on our results of operations. While we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to
manage business continuity planning, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or
other disasters or that our business continuity plans will effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially
mitigate  the  likelihood  or  potential  impact  of  such  events,  or  effectively  manage  such  events  if  they  occur,  particularly  when  a  product  is  sourced  from  a
single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our
supply chain.

The Sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.

As of December 29, 2018, the Sponsors own approximately 49% of our common stock. Four of our current 11 directors had been directors of Heinz prior to
the closing of the 2015 Merger and remained directors of Kraft Heinz pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition, the Board elected Joao M. Castro-Neves,
a  partner  of  3G  Capital,  one  of  the  Sponsors,  effective  June  12,  2019.  Furthermore,  some  of  our  executive  officers,  including  Bernardo  Hees,  our  Chief
Executive Officer, are partners of 3G Capital. As a result, the Sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control
over  decisions  of  our  Board  of  Directors  as  well  as  over  any  action  requiring  the  approval  of  the  holders  of  our  common  stock,  including  adopting  any
amendments to our charter, electing directors, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets. In addition, to the extent
that the Sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock, they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent
to  adopt  amendments  to  our  charter  or  take  other  actions,  such  as  corporate  transactions,  that  require  the  vote  of  holders  of  a  majority  of  our  outstanding
common  stock.  The  directors  designated  by  the  Sponsors  may  have  significant  authority  to  effect  decisions  affecting  our  capital  structure,  including  the
issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the decision of whether
to declare dividends and the amount of any such dividends. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from
time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that
may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to own a
significant amount of our equity, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

Financial Risks

Our level of indebtedness, as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business and financial
condition.

We  have  a  substantial  amount  of  indebtedness,  and  are  permitted  to  incur  a  substantial  amount  of  additional  indebtedness,  including  secured  debt.  Our
existing debt, together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

limiting  our  ability  to  obtain  additional  financing  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  research  and  development,  debt  service  requirements,
acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;

resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, including our commercial paper programs; liquidity;
and access to capital markets;

restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as
highly leveraged;

17

• making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;

•

•

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, payments of dividends, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;

exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency, as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and substantially all of
our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars; and

in the case of any additional indebtedness, exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.

In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us
to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity.
There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or
to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving
credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”) to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)). The
creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity
of our other debt. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and file our
periodic reports with the SEC, we have needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to
avoid being in default.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants  under  the  Senior  Credit  Facility.  As  previously  disclosed,  we  entered  into  two  waiver  agreements  with  respect  to  the  Senior  Credit  Facility,
pursuant to which the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted temporary waivers of
compliance by us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29,
2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than July 31, 2019. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29,
2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July
31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.
For  further  information  related  to  the  two  waiver  agreements,  see  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  in  Item  7,  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

However, we may not be able to secure similar waivers for any future delays in our periodic reports with the SEC. Furthermore, if we breach any covenants
under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors, or we may not be able to remedy
compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors. If this occurs, we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and
unable  to  access  our  Senior  Credit  Facility.  In  addition,  certain  creditors  could  exercise  their  rights,  as  described  above,  and  we  could  be  forced  into
bankruptcy or liquidation.

Additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units, and our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We
test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained
decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to
regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural
disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, or significant adverse
changes  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  We  test  reporting  units  for  impairment  by  comparing  the  estimated  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  with  its
carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the
case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.

18

As detailed in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as a result of our 2018 annual impairment
test in the second quarter of 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $133 million and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $101
million. Additionally, as part of our interim impairment test in the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of
$215 million and a definite-lived intangible asset impairment loss of $3 million.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  our  year-end  financial  statements,  we  assessed  the  changes  in  circumstances  that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts.
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.

While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to  conclude  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  certain  reporting  units  and  brands  were  below  their  carrying  amounts.  These  factors
included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net
assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected
supply  chain  costs  and  increased  competition;  (iii)  the  development  and  approval  of  our  2019  annual  operating  plan  in  December  2018,  which  provided
additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years, such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November
2018  to  sell  certain  assets  in  our  natural  cheese  portfolio  in  Canada,  which  changed  the  composition  and  use  of  the  remaining  assets  and  brands  in  the
associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase
in the United States in December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as
of the end of December 2018.

Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test on these reporting units and brands as of December 29, 2018. As a result of our interim impairment
test, we recognized goodwill impairment losses of $6.9 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of
2018.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic,
and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth
rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges,  and  other  market  factors.  If  current  expectations  of  future  growth  rates  and  margins  are  not  met,  if  market
factors  outside  of  our  control,  such  as  discount  rates,  change,  or  if  management’s  expectations  or  plans  otherwise  change,  including  as  a  result  of  the
development of our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. As detailed in
Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we recorded impairment losses totaling $15.9 billion for
the year ended December 29, 2018. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in
zero  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  2018  impairment  testing  dates.  Accordingly,  these  and  other  individual  reporting  units  and
brands  that  have  20%  or  less  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  testing  date  have  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  if  any
assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future.  Reporting  units  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  had  an  aggregate  goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion  at  December  29,  2018  and  included:  U.S.  Grocery,  U.S.  Refrigerated,  Canada  Retail,  Latin  America  Exports,  Southeast
Europe,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  Northeast  Asia.  Of  the  $29.0 billion  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments,  $9.3 billion  is  attributable  to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Brands with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate carrying amount of
$29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip, Stove Top, ABC, and
Quero. Of  the  $29.3 billion  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments,  $24.0 billion  is  attributable  to  brands  with  0%  excess  fair  value  over  carrying
amount. Although the remaining reporting units and brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment
testing date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition  date  fair  values.  Therefore,  if  any  assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future,  these  amounts  are  also  susceptible  to
impairments, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth.

19

Our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety
of  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  primarily  the  British  pound  sterling,  euro,  Australian  dollar,  Canadian  dollar,  New  Zealand  dollar,  Brazilian  real,
Indonesian rupiah, Chinese renminbi, and Indian rupee. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates
from  period  to  period  will  have  an  impact  on  our  reported  results.  We  have  implemented  currency  hedges  intended  to  reduce  our  exposure  to  changes  in
foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue
to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are
paid  in  a  different  currency.  As  a  result,  factors  associated  with  international  operations,  including  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  could
significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Commodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable
oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, wheat products, cucumbers, onions, other fruits and vegetables, spices, and flour to manufacture our products.
In  addition,  we  purchase  and  use  significant  quantities  of  resins,  metals,  cardboard,  glass,  plastic,  paper,  fiberboard,  and  other  materials  to  package  our
products, and we use other inputs, such as natural gas and water, to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices, which influence both
our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities, energy, and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to
predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather or global climate change, crop failures, or shortages due to plant
disease or insect and other pest infestation, consumer, industrial, or investment demand, and changes in governmental regulation and trade, tariffs, alternative
energy, including increased demand for biofuels, and agricultural programs. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect
to the costs of procuring raw materials, packaging, services, and transporting products, which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our
operations.  Furthermore,  the  cost  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products  may  fluctuate  due  to  movements  in  cross-currency  transaction  rates.  Rising
commodity,  energy,  and  other  input  costs  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  operations,  including  the  manufacture,  transportation,  and
distribution of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against input price
increases to the extent we deem appropriate, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw materials costs. For example, hedging our costs for one of our key commodities, dairy products, is difficult because dairy futures
markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other
supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, increases in the prices of our products to cover
these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes, or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer
pressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input
price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in
our gross profit and net income.

We use commodity futures, options, and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans,
sugar, vegetable oils, wheat products, corn products, cocoa products, packaging products, diesel fuel, and natural gas. We recognize gains and losses based on
changes in the values of these commodity derivatives. We recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income
to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process. We recognize these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment
operating results until we sell the underlying products, at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results. Accordingly, changes in
the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income.

Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.

Inflationary  pressures  and  any  shortages  in  the  labor  market  could  increase  labor  costs,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated
operating  results  or  financial  condition.  Our  labor  costs  include  the  cost  of  providing  employee  benefits  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  other  foreign
jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension
plans, the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally, the annual costs of
benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.

20

Furthermore,  we  may  be  subject  to  increased  costs  or  experience  adverse  effects  to  our  operating  results  if  we  are  unable  to  renew  collectively  bargained
agreements on satisfactory terms. Our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes
or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with union-represented employees both in and outside of the United States.

Regulatory Risks

Compliance  with  laws,  regulations,  and  related  interpretations  and  related  legal  claims  or  other  regulatory  enforcement  actions  could  impact  our
business,  and  we  face  additional  risks  and  uncertainties  related  to  any  potential  actions  resulting  from  the  SEC’s  ongoing  investigation,  as  well  as
potential additional subpoenas, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.

As  a  large,  global  food  and  beverage  company,  we  operate  in  a  highly-regulated  environment  with  constantly-evolving  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks.
Various  laws  and  regulations  govern  production,  storage,  distribution,  sales,  advertising,  labeling,  including  on-pack  claims,  information  or  disclosures,
marketing,  licensing,  trade,  labor,  tax,  environmental  matters,  privacy,  as  well  as  health  and  safety  and  data  protection  practices.  Government  authorities
regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. In particular, Brexit could result in a new regulatory regime in the United Kingdom that may
or may not follow that of the European Union, and the creation of new and divergent laws and regulations could increase the cost and complexity of our
compliance.  In  addition,  this  shift  in  regime  could  create  a  number  of  legal  and  accounting  complexities  with  respect  to  existing  relationships,  including
uncertainty regarding the continuity of contracts entered into by entities in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Our compliance with new or revised
laws and regulations, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial
condition, and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, we are faced with a heightened risk of
legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions.

As  previously  disclosed  on  February  21,  2019,  we  received  a  subpoena  in  October  2018  from  the  SEC  related  to  our  procurement  area,  specifically  the
accounting  policies,  procedures,  and  internal  controls  related  to  our  procurement  function,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  agreements,  side  agreements,  and
changes  or  modifications  to  agreements  with  our  suppliers.  Following  the  receipt  of  this  subpoena,  we,  together  with  external  counsel  and  forensic
accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters.
Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019, when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible
asset impairments, the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting, internal controls, and disclosures, our assessment of goodwill
and intangible asset impairments, and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern District of Illinois also is reviewing this matter, working with the SEC and receiving materials from it. After our earnings release, four securities
class action lawsuits, one class action lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), and five stockholder derivative actions were
filed against us and certain of our current and former officers, directors, and employees. One of the securities class action lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed
without prejudice, while the other matters are still pending.

We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. We are unable, at this time, to estimate our potential liability in these matters, but we may be required
to pay judgments, settlements, or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses in connection with the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits and the
stockholder  derivative  actions.  See  Item  3,  Legal  Proceedings,  and  Note  18,  Commitment  and  Contingencies,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Furthermore,  if  the  SEC  commences  legal  action  as  a  result  of  the  investigation,  we  could  be  required  to  pay  significant  penalties  and  become  subject  to
injunctions, cease and desist orders, and other equitable remedies. The SEC investigation will not be resolved as a result of the completion of the internal
investigation and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory
investigation.

We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the internal
investigation, the SEC investigation, and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses, the delay in timely filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
the  delay  in  timely  filing  our  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  for  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  and  the  diversion  of  the  attention  of  the
management  team  that  has  occurred,  and  is  expected  to  continue,  has  adversely  affected,  and  could  continue  to  adversely  affect,  our  business,  financial
condition, and cash flows.

As  a  result  of  matters  associated  with  the  internal  investigation  related  to  the  SEC  investigation  and  various  lawsuits,  we  are  exposed  to  greater  risks
associated  with  litigation,  regulatory  proceedings,  and  government  enforcement  actions  and  additional  subpoenas.  Any  future  investigations  or  additional
lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

21

We  identified  material  weaknesses  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  If  we  are  unable  to  remediate  these  material  weaknesses,  or  if  we
experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may
not  be  able  to  accurately  and  timely  report  our  financial  results,  in  which  case  our  business  may  be  harmed,  investors  may  lose  confidence  in  the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the price of our common stock may decline.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the
effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  reporting  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other
rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to
furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public
accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

In connection with our most recent year-end assessment of internal control over financial reporting, we determined that, as of December 29, 2018, we did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness in our risk assessment process related to designing and maintaining
controls sufficient to appropriately respond to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to material
weaknesses arising from (i) supplier contracts and related arrangements, and (ii) goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, and we
have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. For further discussion of the material weaknesses
identified and our remedial efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.

Remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. As a result, we may not
be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management, be able to do so in a timely manner, or
be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future.

If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting,
the  accuracy  and  timing  of  our  financial  reporting  may  be  adversely  affected;  our  liquidity,  our  access  to  capital  markets,  the  perceptions  of  our
creditworthiness, and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable
securities laws, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements
regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial
reporting; we may suffer defaults, accelerations, or cross-accelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to
obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches; and our stock price may decline.

Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, restricts our
ability to issue equity securities, including within the Kraft Heinz Savings Plan and the Kraft Heinz Union Savings Plan (collectively, the “Plan”), and
could impact our listing on Nasdaq.

We did not file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018 or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
March 30, 2019 within each respective timeframe required by the SEC, meaning we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC.
This limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business
strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would
allow  us  to  continuously  incorporate  by  reference  our  SEC  reports  into  the  registration  statement,  or  to  use  “shelf”  registration  statements  to  conduct
offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering now, we would be
required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer
than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and the necessity of using a Form S-1 for a public offering of registered
securities  could,  to  the  extent  we  are  not  able  to  conduct  offerings  using  alternative  methods,  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  raise  capital  or  complete
acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.

22

In addition, as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8 registration
statements. As a result, on April 23, 2019, the administrator of the Plan issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during
which participants are prohibited from acquiring beneficial ownership of additional interests in The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund. If we are not able to
become and remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, it restricts our ability to maintain The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund or issue
other equity securities to our employees.

As  previously  disclosed,  we  also  received  notices  from  Nasdaq  regarding  our  noncompliance  with  Nasdaq  Listing  Rule  5250(c)(1),  which  requires  listed
companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We timely submitted our plan to regain compliance, and Nasdaq granted the
Company  until  September  11,  2019  to  regain  compliance,  subject  to  our  compliance  with  certain  terms  outlined  in  the  notice  received  on  May  15,  2019,
including filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended March 30, 2019, which we expect to file as promptly as practicable following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are not able
to file before September 11, 2019, however, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.

We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may
affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues.

As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial
Data (Unaudited), in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
for  the  years  ended  December  30,  2017  and  December  31,  2016  and  to  restate  each  of  the  quarterly  and  year-to-date  periods  for  the  nine  months  ended
September  29,  2018  and  for  fiscal  year  2017,  following  the  identification  of  misstatements  as  a  result  of  the  internal  investigation  conducted.  We  do  not
believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of
the  matters  identified  in  our  internal  investigation,  including  the  number  of  years  over  which  the  misconduct  occurred  and  the  number  of  transactions,
suppliers,  and  procurement  employees  involved,  we  determined  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to  correct  the  misstatements  in  our  previously  issued
consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and
uncorrected  misstatements  in  the  impacted  periods.  As  a  result,  we  have  incurred  unanticipated  costs  for  accounting  and  legal  fees  in  connection  with  or
related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of
our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We  consider  our  intellectual  property  rights,  particularly  and  most  notably  our  trademarks,  but  also  our  patents,  trade  secrets,  trade  dress,  copyrights,  and
licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of
patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and trade dress laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and
policing  of  third-party  misuses  of  our  intellectual  property.  Our  failure  to  develop  or  adequately  protect  our  trademarks,  products,  new  features  of  our
products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property,
may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition. We also license certain intellectual property, most notably
trademarks, from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with
these third parties, our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted.

We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands, or products. Any litigation regarding patents or
other  intellectual  property  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming  and  could  divert  the  attention  of  our  management  and  key  personnel  from  our  business
operations. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to
significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

23

Changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on
the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable
tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the
interpretation  of  existing  laws  and  rules.  Federal,  state,  and  local  governments  and  administrative  bodies  within  the  United  States,  which  represents  the
majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms
that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax
rate,  our  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  taxation  of  foreign  earnings.  The  comprehensive  impact  of  U.S.  Tax  Reform  is  yet  to  be  determined,  and  future
guidance and interpretations may have adverse or uncertain effects. Relatedly, changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development’s (“OECD”) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing (“BEPS”) could impact our effective tax rate. It is
not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact
on our business and financial condition.

Significant  judgment,  knowledge,  and  experience  are  required  in  determining  our  worldwide  provision  for  income  taxes.  Our  future  effective  tax  rate  is
impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in geographic mix of income, increases
in expenses not deductible for tax, including impairment of goodwill, and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we
believe  our  tax  estimates  are  reasonable,  the  final  determination  of  tax  audits  and  any  related  litigation  could  be  materially  different  from  our  historical
income tax provisions and accruals. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more
difficult. The results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Registered Securities Risks

Sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, sales of our common stock by the Sponsors, or the perception that these
sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity
securities. A sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened (in November and December 2018, which was a contributing factor
to our decision to perform an interim impairment test for certain reporting units and brands in the fourth quarter of 2018, for which we ultimately recorded
impairment losses) and could in the future happen, which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets, which could increase
the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Kraft Heinz, 3G Capital, and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all
registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which represents all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsors as of the date of the
closing  of  the  2015  Merger.  As  of  December  29,  2018,  registrable  shares  represented  approximately  49%  of  all  outstanding  shares  of  our  common  stock.
Although  the  registrable  shares  are  subject  to  certain  holdback  and  suspension  periods,  the  registrable  shares  are  not  subject  to  a  “lock-up”  or  similar
restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly, offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement. Sales of our common stock by the Sponsors
to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our
common stock.

Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and
may be limited by our financial condition, debt agreements, or limitations under Delaware law.

Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof
will  be  at  the  discretion  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  will  be  dependent  on  then-existing  conditions,  including  our  financial  condition,  income,  legal
requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, debt agreements, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors has
decided, and may in the future decide, in its sole discretion, to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely.
For these reasons, shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly, realization of any gain on shares of our
common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.

24

Volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business.

Changes in financial and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, uncertainty regarding Brexit, and interest rate volatility, including as
a  result  of  the  use  or  discontinued  use  of  certain  benchmark  rates  such  as  LIBOR,  may  increase  the  cost  of  financing  as  well  as  the  risks  of  refinancing
maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these ratings
could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.

Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger
customers,  some  of  which  are  highly  leveraged  and  facing  increased  competition  and  continued  credit  market  volatility.  These  factors  have  caused  some
customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or
counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Item 2. Properties.

Our  corporate  co-headquarters  are  located  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania  and  Chicago,  Illinois.  Our  co-headquarters  are  leased  and  house  certain  executive
offices,  our  U.S.  business  units,  and  our  administrative,  finance,  legal,  and  human  resource  functions.  We  maintain  additional  owned  and  leased  offices
throughout the regions in which we operate.

We manufacture our products in our network of manufacturing and processing facilities located throughout the world. As of December 29, 2018, we operated
84 manufacturing and processing facilities. We own 81 and lease three of these facilities. Our manufacturing and processing facilities count by segment as of

(a) As  previously  disclosed,  we  adopted  a  new  accounting  standard  related  to  revenue  recognition  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  and  at  the  same  time,  we  retrospectively  corrected  immaterial
misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications. This resulted in net sales decreases of $147 million in 2017, $152
million in 2016, and $55 million in 2015.

(b) The increases in net sales in 2016 and in 2015 compared to the prior year, and the increases in total assets and long-term debt from December 28, 2014 to January 3, 2016, were primarily driven

by the 2015 Merger.

27

(c) We have restated previously disclosed consolidated financial data for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, as well as the related balance sheet dates, to correct misstatements principally related to
supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements,  as  well  as  other  identified  out-of-period  and  uncorrected  misstatements.  See  Note  2,  Restatement  of  Previously  Issued  Consolidated  Financial
Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

(d) The increases in income/(loss), income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders, and basic and diluted income/(loss) per common share in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily driven by

U.S. Tax Reform, which was enacted in December 2017. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

(e) The decreases in income/(loss), income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders, and basic and diluted income/(loss) per common share in 2018 compared to 2017, and the decrease in total
assets  from  December  30,  2017  to  December  29,  2018,  were  primarily  driven  by  non-cash  impairment  losses  in  2018.  See  Note  10,  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets,  in  Item  8,  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

(f) Amounts exclude the current portion of long-term debt.

(g) On  June  7,  2016,  we  redeemed  all  outstanding  shares  of  our  9.00%  cumulative  compounding  preferred  stock,  Series  A  (“Series  A  Preferred  Stock”).  See  Equity  and  Dividends  in  Item  7,
Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  along  with  Note  19,  Debt,  and  Note  20,  Capital  Stock,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.

(h) On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31, 2016, we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year
ending  on  the  last  Saturday  in  December  in  each  calendar  year.  In  prior  years,  we  operated  on  a  52-  or  53-week  fiscal  year  ending  the  Sunday  closest  to  December  31.  As  a  result,  we
occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year. Our 2015 fiscal year includes a 53rd week of activity.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements:

We have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to the “Explanatory Note”
preceding Item 1, Business, for background on the restatement, the fiscal periods impacted, control considerations, and other information.

In addition, we have restated certain previously reported financial information at December 30, 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016 in this Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  including  but  not  limited  to
information within the Consolidated Results of Operations, Results of Operations by Segment, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures  sections.  We  have  also
included certain restated quarterly information in the Supplemental Quarterly Financial Information section at the end of this item.

See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,  for  additional
information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the misstatements and the impacts on our consolidated financial statements.

Description of the Company:
We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee,
and other grocery products throughout the world.

We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and EMEA. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two operating segments: Latin America and
APAC.

Our  segments  reflect  a  change,  effective  in  the  first  quarter  of  our  fiscal  year  2018,  to  reorganize  our  international  businesses  to  better  align  our  global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical AMEA operating segment into the historical Europe reportable segment,
forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became the APAC operating segment. We have
reflected this change in all historical periods presented.

See  Note  22,  Segment  Reporting,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our  financial
information by segment.

28

Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results

Impairment Losses:
Our 2018 results reflect goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses of $15.9 billion compared to $49 million in 2017. The increase was primarily driven
by impairment losses of $15.5 billion recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  our  year-end  financial  statements,  we  assessed  the  changes  in  circumstances  that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts.
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.

While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to  conclude  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  certain  reporting  units  and  brands  were  below  their  carrying  amounts.  These  factors
included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net
assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected
supply  chain  costs  and  increased  competition;  (iii)  the  development  and  approval  of  our  2019  annual  operating  plan  in  December  2018,  which  provided
additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years, such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November
2018  to  sell  certain  assets  in  our  natural  cheese  portfolio  in  Canada,  which  changed  the  composition  and  use  of  the  remaining  assets  and  brands  in  the
associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase
in the United States in December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as
of the end of December 2018.

As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts, we performed an
interim impairment test as of December 29, 2018. As a result of our interim impairment test, we recognized goodwill impairment losses of $6.9 billion and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment losses of $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.

See Critical Accounting Estimates within this item and Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

U.S. Tax Reform:
U.S. Tax Reform legislation enacted by the federal government on December 22, 2017 significantly changed U.S. tax laws by, among other things, lowering
the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective January 1, 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries  as  of  December  30,  2017.  In  addition,  there  were  many  new  provisions,  including  changes  to  bonus  depreciation,  revised  deductions  for
executive  compensation  and  interest  expense,  a  tax  on  global  intangible  low-taxed  income  (“GILTI”),  the  base  erosion  anti-abuse  tax  (“BEAT”),  and  a
deduction  for  foreign-derived  intangible  income  (“FDII”).  While  the  corporate  tax  rate  reduction  was  effective  January  1,  2018,  we  accounted  for  this
anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion in 2017.
As a result, U.S. Tax Reform significantly impacted our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes and our effective tax rate, primarily in 2017, resulting in a
lack of comparability year over year.

See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Integration and Restructuring Expenses:
At the end of 2017, we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the “Integration Program”), which was
designed  to  reduce  costs  and  integrate  and  optimize  our  combined  organization.  As  of  December  29,  2018,  we  had  incurred  cumulative  pre-tax  costs  of
$2,146  million  related  to  the  Integration  Program.  These  costs  primarily  included  severance  and  employee  benefit  costs  (including  cash  and  non-cash
severance),  costs  to  exit  facilities  (including  non-cash  costs  such  as  accelerated  depreciation),  and  other  costs  incurred  as  a  direct  result  of  integration
activities. Approximately 60%  of  total  Integration  Program  costs  were  cash  expenditures.  As  of  December  29,  2018,  we  had  incurred  approximately  $1.4
billion in capital expenditures related to the Integration Program since its inception in 2015.

Related to our restructuring activities, including the Integration Program, we recognized expenses of $460 million in 2018, $434 million in 2017, and $1.0
billion in 2016. Integration Program expenses included in these totals were $92 million in 2018, $316 million, in 2017, and $887 million in 2016.

See Note 6, Integration and Restructuring Expenses, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Results of Operations

We disclose in this report certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a
consistent  basis  for  purposes  of  business  decision-making  by  removing  the  impact  of  certain  items  that  management  believes  do  not  directly  reflect  our
underlying operations. For additional information and reconciliations from our consolidated financial statements see Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

The restatement described in the Overview section within this item did not significantly impact the drivers of our consolidated results of operations or our
results  of  operations  by  segment.  See  Note  2,  Restatement  of  Previously  Issued  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary Data, for additional information.

In addition, during the period between December 29, 2018 and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain industry trends impacting our results of
operations as described herein, including increased costs in procurement and logistics, pricing pressure as a result of increased private label competition, and
consumer trends focused on health and wellness, have continued.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:

Net sales increased 0.7% to $26.3 billion in 2018 compared to $26.1 billion in 2017, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.6 pp) and the net
favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (0.4 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 0.9% to $26.1 billion in 2018 compared to $25.9 billion in 2017 driven
by favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp). Volume/mix was favorable in all segments. Pricing was flat, with lower pricing in the United States and Canada offset by
higher pricing in Rest of World (primarily driven by highly inflationary environments in certain markets within Latin America) and EMEA.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Net sales decreased 0.9% to $26.1 billion in 2017 compared to $26.3 billion in 2016. The impacts of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures were
flat. Organic Net Sales decreased 0.9% to $26.0 billion in 2017 compared to $26.2 billion in 2016 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.5 pp), partially offset by
higher pricing (0.6 pp). Volume/mix was unfavorable in the United States and Canada, partially offset by growth in Rest of World and EMEA. Higher pricing
in Rest of World and the United States was partially offset by lower pricing in Canada and EMEA.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:

Operating income/(loss) decreased 268.7% to a loss of $10.2 billion in 2018 compared to income of $6.1 billion in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to
higher impairment losses in 2018. Impairment losses were $15.9 billion in 2018 compared to $49 million in 2017. The remaining $390 million decrease in
operating income/(loss) was due to higher input costs and strategic investments. These decreases to operating income/(loss) were partially offset by lower
Integration  Program  and  other  restructuring  expenses,  the  favorable  impact  of  foreign  currency  (4.2  pp),  the  benefit  from  the  postemployment  benefits
accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018, savings from Integration Program and other restructuring activities, and productivity savings. See Note
10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our impairment losses.

Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders decreased 193.2% to a loss of $10.2 billion in 2018 compared to income of $10.9 billion in 2017. The
decrease was primarily due to the operating income/(loss) factors described above (primarily higher impairment losses in 2018), as well as a lower tax benefit,
unfavorable changes in other expense/(income), net, and higher interest expense, which are detailed as follows:

•

•

•

The effective tax rate was a benefit of 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss compared to a benefit of 100.6% in 2017 on pre-tax income. The 2018 effective
tax rate was lower, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate, non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments, nonmonetary
currency devaluation losses, and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans), the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our deferred
tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform, which were partially offset by the benefit from intangible asset impairment
losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information
related to our effective tax rates.

Other expense/(income), net was income of $183 million in 2018 compared to income of $627 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a
$162 million non-cash settlement charge in 2018 related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans
compared to a $177 million  non-cash  curtailment  gain  from  postretirement  plan  remeasurements  in  2017.  In  addition,  this  decrease  was  due  to  a
$146  million  nonmonetary  currency  devaluation  loss  in  the  current  period  compared  to  a  $36  million  loss  in  the  prior  period  related  to  our
Venezuelan  operations.  See  Note  16,  Venezuela  -  Foreign  Currency  and  Inflation,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  for
additional information.

Interest expense was $1.3 billion in 2018 compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $3.0 billion aggregate principal
amount  of  long-term  debt  issued  in  June  2018.  See  Note  19,  Debt,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  for  additional
information.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.3% to $7.0 billion in 2018 compared to $7.7 billion in 2017, primarily due to higher input costs, strategic investments, higher
overhead  costs,  and  the  unfavorable  impact  of  foreign  currency  (0.5  pp),  partially  offset  by  savings  from  Integration  Program  and  other  restructuring
activities, and productivity savings.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Operating income/(loss) increased 8.1% to $6.1 billion  in  2017  compared  to  $5.6 billion  in  2016.  This  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  savings  from  the
Integration Program and other restructuring activities, lower Integration Program and other restructuring expenses in 2017, and lower overhead costs, partially
offset by higher input costs in local currency, lower Organic Net Sales, lower unrealized gains on commodity hedges in 2017, and the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency (0.4 pp).

31

Net  income/(loss)  attributable  to  common  shareholders  increased  220.3%  to  $10.9  billion  in  2017  compared  to  $3.4  billion  in  2016.  The  increase  was
primarily driven by U.S. Tax Reform, the operating income/(loss) factors discussed above, the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend in 2017, and
favorable changes in other expense/(income), net, partially offset by higher interest expense, detailed as follows:

•

•

•

•

The effective tax rate was a 100.6% benefit in 2017 compared to 27.0% expense in 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven
by the $7.0 billion tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform, lower tax benefits associated with deferred tax effects of statutory rate changes, and taxes on
income  of  foreign  subsidiaries  in  2017.  See  Note  11,  Income  Taxes,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  for  additional
information related to our effective tax rates.

The  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  was  fully  redeemed  on  June  7,  2016.  Accordingly,  there  were  no  dividends  for  2017,  compared  to  $180  million  in
2016. See Equity and Dividends within this item for additional information.

Other expense/(income), net was $627 million of income in 2017 compared to $472 million of income in 2016. This increase was primarily driven
by  a  $177  million  non-cash  curtailment  gain  from  postretirement  plan  remeasurements  in  2017.  This  was  partially  offset  by  a  $36  million
nonmonetary currency devaluation loss in 2017 compared to $24 million  in  2016  related  to  our  Venezuelan  operations.  See  Note  16,  Venezuela -
Foreign Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Interest expense increased to $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.1 billion in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the May 2016 issuances of
long-term debt and borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which began in the second quarter of 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.2% to $7.7 billion in 2017 compared to $7.6 billion in 2016, primarily driven by savings from the Integration Program and
other restructuring activities and lower overhead costs, partially offset by higher input costs in local currency, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.2
pp), and a decline in Organic Net Sales.

(a) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

Adjusted EPS increased 0.3% to $3.51 in 2018 compared to $3.50 in 2017, driven by lower taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period, the benefit from
the  postemployment  benefits  accounting  change  adopted  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  and  the  effect  of  dilutive  equity  awards,  partially  offset  by  lower
Adjusted EBITDA, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization in the current period. We have excluded the effect of dilutive equity
awards in 2018 as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS because of the net loss attributable to common shareholders. In 2017, the
effect of dilutive equity awards was included.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Diluted EPS increased 220.5% to $8.91 in 2017 compared to $2.78 in 2016, primarily driven by the net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders
factors discussed above.

(a) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.

Adjusted EPS increased 5.7% to $3.50 in 2017 compared to $3.31 in 2016, primarily driven by the absence of Series A Preferred Stock dividends in 2017 and
Adjusted EBITDA growth despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, partially offset by higher interest expense.

Results of Operations by Segment

Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales, Organic Net Sales, and segment adjusted earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation, and amortization (“Segment Adjusted EBITDA”). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations
before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and
restructuring  expenses);  in  addition  to  these  adjustments,  we  exclude,  when  they  occur,  the  impacts  of  integration  and  restructuring  expenses,  deal  costs,
unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the
gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, other gains/(losses)
related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity
award  compensation  expense  (excluding  integration  and  restructuring  expenses).  Segment  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  a  tool  that  can  assist  management  and
investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our
underlying operations.

Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar. As a result, we must revalue the results of our
Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S. dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (“DICOM”) rates,
and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are
recorded in current net income and are classified within other expense/(income), net as nonmonetary currency devaluation. See Note 16, Venezuela - Foreign
Currency and Inflation, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:

Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 0.6% to $18.1 billion in 2018 compared to $18.2 billion in 2017 primarily due to lower pricing (0.9 pp), partially
offset by favorable volume/mix (0.3 pp). Pricing was lower across most categories, particularly in ready-to-drink beverages, cheese, and meat, partially offset
by  increases  in  boxed  dinners  and  condiments  and  sauces.  Favorable  volume/mix  across  several  categories,  particularly  in  ready-to-drink  beverages,  was
partially offset by lower shipments in cheese.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.2% to $5.2 billion in 2018 compared to $5.9 billion in 2017 primarily due to non-key commodity cost inflation,
lower  Organic  Net  Sales,  strategic  investments,  and  higher  overhead  costs,  partially  offset  by  favorable  key  commodity  costs,  and  Integration  Program
savings.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased 1.3% to $18.2 billion in 2018 compared to $18.5 billion in 2017 due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.8 pp), partially
offset  by  higher  pricing  (0.5 pp).  Unfavorable  volume/mix  was  primarily  driven  by  distribution  losses  in  nuts,  cheese,  and  meat,  and  lower  shipments  in
foodservice. The decline was partially offset by gains in refrigerated meal combinations, boxed dinners, and frozen meals. Pricing was higher driven primarily
by price increases in cheese.

36

Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.2% to $5.9 billion in 2017 compared to $5.7 billion in 2016 primarily driven by Integration Program savings and
lower overhead costs, partially offset by unfavorable key commodity costs, primarily in dairy, meat, and coffee, as well as unfavorable volume/mix.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:

Net sales decreased 0.2% to $2.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.3 pp). Organic Net
Sales increased 0.1% to $2.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017 driven by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (0.6
pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in cheese and coffee, primarily due to earlier execution of go-to-market agreements
with key retailers, partially offset by lower shipments in condiments and sauces. Lower pricing in cheese was partially offset by increases across a number of
categories, particularly in foodservice.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.4% to $608 million in 2018 compared to $636 million in 2017, partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
currency (0.3 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower pricing, higher overhead costs, and higher
input costs in local currency.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Net sales decreased 5.4% to $2.2 billion in 2017 compared to $2.3 billion in 2016, despite the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.9 pp).  Organic  Net
Sales  decreased  7.3%  to  $2.1  billion  in  2017  compared  to  $2.3  billion  in  2016  due  to  unfavorable  volume/mix  (5.5  pp)  and  lower  pricing  (1.8  pp).
Volume/mix was unfavorable across several categories and was most pronounced in cheese, coffee, and boxed dinners, primarily due to delayed execution of
go-to-market agreements with key retailers, retail distribution losses (primarily in cheese), and lower inventory levels at retail versus the prior year. Lower
pricing was due to higher promotional activity, primarily in cheese.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.7% to $636 million in 2017 compared to $632 million in 2016, despite the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.7
pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower Organic Net Sales partially offset by Integration Program
savings and lower overhead costs in 2017.

Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017:

Net sales increased 5.1% to $2.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.6 billion in 2017 driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency (2.5 pp), partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (1.5 pp). Organic Net Sales increased 4.1% to $2.6 billion in 2018 compared to $2.5 billion in 2017
driven  by  favorable  volume/mix  (3.2 pp)  and  higher  pricing  (0.9  pp).  Favorable  volume/mix  was  primarily  driven  by  growth  in  condiments  and  sauces,
including the addition of Kraft products in certain regions, and gains in foodservice. Pricing was higher, primarily driven by higher pricing in Middle East and
Africa, and favorable timing of promotional activity versus the prior year in the UK, partially offset by lower pricing in eastern Europe.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% to $724 million in 2018 compared to $673 million in 2017, including the favorable impact of foreign currency
(3.2 pp).  Excluding  the  currency  impact,  the  increase  was  primarily  driven  by  Organic  Net  Sales  growth,  productivity  savings,  and  the  benefit  from  the
postemployment benefits accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher supply chain costs in the Middle East and Africa.

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Net sales were flat at $2.6 billion in 2017 and in 2016, despite the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (0.5 pp) and acquisitions and divestitures (0.3 pp).
Organic Net Sales increased 0.8% to $2.5 billion in 2017 compared to $2.5 billion in 2016 driven by favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by lower
pricing (0.5 pp). Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by higher shipments in foodservice and growth in condiments and sauces, partially offset by
ongoing declines in infant nutrition in Italy. Pricing was lower, primarily driven by higher promotional activity in the UK and Italy versus the prior period,
partially offset by higher pricing in the Middle East and Africa.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 9.3% to $673 million in 2017 compared to $741 million in 2016, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
(1.4 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the decrease was due to higher input costs in local currency, partially offset by productivity savings.

pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar), which more than offset the favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (5.3 pp). Organic Net Sales
increased 7.9% to $3.2 billion in 2018 compared to $2.9 billion in 2017 driven by higher pricing (5.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (2.5 pp).  Pricing  was
higher primarily driven by highly inflationary environments in certain markets within Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was driven by growth across
several categories, which was most pronounced in condiments and sauces, partially offset by lower shipments in Southeast Asia.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $635 million in 2018 compared to $590 million in 2017, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
(12.7 pp, including 11.4 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA was

Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016:

Net sales increased 4.8% to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion in 2016, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.8 pp, including 2.0
pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Organic Net Sales increased 5.6% to $3.0 billion in 2017 compared to $2.9 billion  in  2016  driven  by
higher pricing (4.2 pp) and favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local
currency, primarily in Latin America. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions partially offset by
volume/mix declines in several markets associated with distributor network re-alignment.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.0% to $590 million in 2017 compared to $621 million in 2016, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
(2.9 pp, including 3.5 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily
due to higher input costs in local currency and higher commercial investments, partially offset by Organic Net Sales growth.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies
we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting
policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that
occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions
to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We
recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.

Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We  promote  our  products  with  advertising,  consumer  incentives,  and  performance  obligations  related  to  trade  promotions.  Consumer  incentives  and  trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable
consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to
customers  and  consumers  at  the  end  of  a  period.  We  base  these  estimates  principally  on  historical  utilization,  redemption  rates,  and/or  current  period
experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.

Advertising  expenses  are  recorded  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  (“SG&A”).  For  interim  reporting  purposes,  we  charge  advertising  to
operations  as  a  percentage  of  estimated  full  year  sales  activity  and  marketing  costs.  We  review  and  adjust  these  estimates  each  quarter  based  on  actual
experience  and  other  information.  We  recorded  advertising  expenses  of  $584  million  in  2018,  $629  million  in  2017,  and  $708  million  in  2016,  which
represented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. The decrease in advertising expenses in 2018
compared to 2017 was driven by a shift from traditional ad spaces to non-traditional ad spaces. We also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as
shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs were $1,140
million in 2018, $1,115 million in 2017, and $1,221 million in 2016.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying amount of $36.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. Our  indefinite-lived
intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $44.0 billion as of December 29,
2018.

39

We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  or  brand  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount.  Such  events  and  circumstances  could  include  a
sustained  decrease  in  our  market  capitalization,  increased  competition  or  unexpected  loss  of  market  share,  increased  input  costs  beyond  projections  (for
example due to regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example
due  to  a  natural  disaster  or  loss  of  a  customer,  supplier,  or  other  significant  business  relationship),  unexpected  significant  declines  in  operating  results,  or
significant  adverse  changes  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  We  test  reporting  units  for  impairment  by  comparing  the  estimated  fair  value  of  each
reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and
carrying amount, in the case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic,
and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth
rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges,  and  other  market  factors.  If  current  expectations  of  future  growth  rates  and  margins  are  not  met,  if  market
factors  outside  of  our  control,  such  as  discount  rates,  change,  or  if  management’s  expectations  or  plans  otherwise  change,  including  as  a  result  of  the
development of our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future. As detailed in
Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we recorded impairment losses totaling $15.9 billion for
the year ended December 29, 2018. Our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in
zero  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  2018  impairment  testing  dates.  Accordingly,  these  and  other  individual  reporting  units  and
brands  that  have  20%  or  less  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  testing  date  have  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  if  any
assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future.  Reporting  units  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  had  an  aggregate  goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion  at  December  29,  2018  and  included:  U.S.  Grocery,  U.S.  Refrigerated,  Canada  Retail,  Latin  America  Exports,  Southeast
Europe,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  Northeast  Asia.  Of  the  $29.0 billion  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments,  $9.3 billion  is  attributable  to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Brands with a heightened risk of future impairments had an aggregate carrying amount of
$29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip, Stove Top, ABC, and
Quero. Of  the  $29.3 billion  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments,  $24.0 billion  is  attributable  to  brands  with  0%  excess  fair  value  over  carrying
amount. Although the remaining reporting units and brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment
testing date, these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated
acquisition  date  fair  values.  Therefore,  if  any  assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future,  these  amounts  are  also  susceptible  to
impairments.

We  generally  utilize  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  under  the  income  approach  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  reporting  units.  Some  of  the  more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit (including net sales,
cost  of  products  sold,  SG&A,  depreciation  and  amortization,  working  capital,  and  capital  expenditures),  income  tax  rates,  long-term  growth  rates,  and  a
discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using
historical  data,  supplemented  by  current  and  anticipated  market  conditions,  estimated  product  category  growth  rates,  management’s  plans,  and  guideline
companies.

We  generally  utilize  the  excess  earnings  method  under  the  income  approach  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  certain  of  our  largest  brands.  Some  of  the  more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales, cost of
products  sold,  and  SG&A),  contributory  asset  charges,  income  tax  considerations,  long-term  growth  rates,  a  discount  rate  that  reflects  the  level  of  risk
associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in
the  financial  forecasts  using  historical  data,  supplemented  by  current  and  anticipated  market  conditions,  estimated  product  category  growth  rates,
management’s plans, and guideline companies.

We  generally  utilize  the  relief  from  royalty  method  under  the  income  approach  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  remaining  brands.  Some  of  the  more
significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand, royalty rates (as a percentage of net
sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee), income tax considerations, long-term growth rates, a discount
rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand, and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely.
We  selected  the  assumptions  used  in  the  financial  forecasts  using  historical  data,  supplemented  by  current  and  anticipated  market  conditions,  estimated
product category growth rates, management’s plans, and guideline companies.

The discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates we used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair
value over carrying amount, as of the latest 2018 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand, were as follows:

Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts
and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in
isolation. However, as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur, as a sensitivity measure, we have presented the estimated effects of
isolated changes in discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates for our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying
amount. If we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying
amount, as of the latest testing date for each of these reporting units and brands, these isolated changes, which are reasonably possible to occur, would have
led to the following increase/(decrease) in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands (in billions):

(a) A reduction in fair value would not necessarily cause an impairment in all cases, but due to the low or zero excess fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units and brands, it is

reasonably possible that a reduction in fair value would lead to an impairment.

Definite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  periods  benefited.  We  review  definite-lived  intangible  assets  for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
When  testing  for  impairment  of  definite-lived  intangible  assets  held  for  use,  we  group  assets  at  the  lowest  level  for  which  cash  flows  are  separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details related to our 2018 impairment testing.

Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform a qualitative assessment each interim reporting period to determine
if it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is below its carrying amount. While we have not completed such impairment assessment
for the first fiscal quarter of 2019, nor have we completed our 2019 annual impairment testing as of the first day of our second fiscal quarter, it is reasonably
possible that an impairment of certain reporting units or brands could occur based on continued industry trends impacting our results of operations.

Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We  maintain  various  retirement  plans  for  the  majority  of  our  employees.  These  include  pension  benefits,  postretirement  health  care  benefits,  and  defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the  plan  is  active  or  inactive.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  our  plan  assets  result  in  net  actuarial  gains  or  losses.  These  net  actuarial  gains  and  losses  are
deferred  into  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(losses)  and  amortized  within  other  expense/(income),  net  in  future  periods  using  the  corridor
approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive.

41

For  our  postretirement  benefit  plans,  our  2019  health  care  cost  trend  rate  assumption  will  be  6.7%.  We  established  this  rate  based  upon  our  most  recent
experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%.
The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan, ranging between the years 2019 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the
following effects, increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation, as of December 29, 2018 (in millions):

Our 2019 discount rate assumption will be 4.3% for service cost and 4.1% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 discount rate assumption
will  be  4.6%  for  service  cost  and  4.4%  for  interest  cost  for  our  U.S.  pension  plans  and  3.4%  for  service  cost  and  3.3%  for  interest  cost  for  our  non-U.S.
pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future
cash flows of the plans. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.

In 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement benefit
plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components. We now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the
specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost
and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the
period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit
cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We accounted for this
change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

Our 2019 expected return on plan assets will be 5.4% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 expected rate of return on plan assets
will be 5.7% for our U.S. pension plans and 5.4% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan
assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current and future asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to
maintain our target asset allocation by re-balancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments.

While  we  do  not  anticipate  further  changes  in  the  2019  assumptions  for  our  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  pension  and  postretirement  benefit  plans,  as  a  sensitivity
measure, a 100-basis-point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following
effects, increase/(decrease) in cost (in millions):

Income Taxes:
We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn
income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for
tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that
we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax
benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the
impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits, we do not consider information that has become
available  after  the  balance  sheet  date,  however  we  do  disclose  the  effects  of  new  information  whenever  those  effects  would  be  material  to  our  financial
statements. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of
benefit  recognized  for  financial  reporting.  These  unrecognized  tax  benefits  are  recorded  primarily  within  other  non-current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated
balance sheets.

We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment  about  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets  in  future  years,  we  would  adjust  related  valuation  allowances  in  the  period  that  the  change  in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be
material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position.

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 4, New Accounting Standards, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.

Contingencies

See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of our contingencies.

Commodity Trends

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable
oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, and wheat products to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of
resins, metals, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of
these commodities.

We define our key commodities in the United States and Canada as dairy, meat, coffee, and nuts. In 2018, we experienced cost decreases for dairy, coffee, and
meat, while costs for nuts increased. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk
management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends.

Dairy  commodities,  primarily  milk  and  cheese,  are  the  most  significant  cost  components  of  our  cheese  products.  We  purchase  our  dairy  raw  material
requirements from independent third parties, such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand, as well as government
programs,  significantly  influence  the  prices  for  milk  and  other  dairy  products.  Significant  cost  components  of  our  meat  products  include  pork,  beef,  and
poultry, which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the
prices of these meat products. The most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans, which we purchase on global markets. Quality and
availability of supply, currency fluctuations, and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices. The most significant cost components in
our nut products include peanuts, cashews, and almonds, which we purchase on both domestic and global markets, where global market supply and demand is
the primary driver of prices.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, commercial paper programs, and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet
our working capital needs, future contractual obligations (including repayments of long-term debt), payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends, planned
capital expenditures, restructuring expenditures, and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans. An additional potential source of liquidity is access
to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. Overall, while, as noted above, we
are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3, we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material
effect on our short-term or long-term liquidity.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility and certain indentures. As a result, we obtained temporary waivers from certain creditors under our indebtedness
instruments. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated
financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019. See the “Total Debt” section below for additional information.

Cash Flow Activity for 2018 Compared to 2017:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $501 million for the year ended December 30,
2017. This increase was primarily driven by decreased postemployment benefit contributions in 2018, the timing of income tax payments, higher collections
on trade receivables as fewer were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables in connection with the unwind of all of our accounts receivable securitization and
factoring programs (the “Programs”) in 2018, and decreased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2018. These increases in cash provided by operating
activities were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.

Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $288 million for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30,
2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections on previously sold receivables of $990 million, as we unwound all of our Programs in 2018,
and cash payments to acquire businesses in 2018, primarily Cerebos Pacific Limited. These decreases in cash provided by investing activities were partially
offset by decreased capital expenditures, which was driven by the wind-up of Integration Program footprint costs in the prior year. We expect 2019 capital
expenditures to be approximately $800 million. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including Note 17, Financing Arrangements,
for  additional  information  on  our  Programs,  Note  5,  Acquisitions  and  Divestitures,  for  additional  information  on  our  2018  acquisitions,  and  Note  6,
Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information on the Integration Program.

Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $3.4 billion for the year ended December 29, 2018 compared to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017.
This decrease was primarily driven by increased proceeds from long-term debt issuances, which more than offset increased cash distributions related to our
dividends, higher net repayments of commercial paper, and higher repayments of long-term debt. See Note 19, Debt, in Item 8, Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary  Data,  for  additional  information  on  our  long-term  debt  issuances  and  repayments.  See  Equity  and  Dividends  in  this  item  for  additional
information on our dividends.

Cash Flow Activity for 2017 Compared to 2016:
Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities was $501 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the $1.2 billion pre-funding of our postretirement benefit plans in 2017,
lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables, favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term
renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year, and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our pre-funding of postretirement plan benefits following
U.S. Tax Reform enactment on December 22, 2017.

Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities:
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from our Programs, as well as lower proceeds from cash
settlements on net investment hedges. Capital expenditures were flat in 2017 compared to 2016.

Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities:
Net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The decrease was driven by the benefit of fewer dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016, which more than offset higher net repayments of long-term
debt  and  commercial  paper  in  2017  compared  to  2016,  including  cash  outflows  associated  with  the  redemption  of  our  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  in  2016.
Dividend payments were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the absence of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend and the impact of four common stock
cash distributions in 2017 compared to five such distributions in 2016. See Equity and Dividends for additional information on cash distributions related to
common stock and Series A Preferred Stock.

Cash Held by International Subsidiaries:
Of the $1.1 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018, $923 million was held by international subsidiaries.

We  consider  the  unremitted  current  year  earnings  of  certain  international  subsidiaries  that  impose  local  country  taxes  on  dividends  to  be  indefinitely
reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately
$20 million.

Our historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through December 30, 2017 are undistributed and currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested. As of
December 29, 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2 billion of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will be
owed when this cash is distributed.

Total Debt:
We  obtain  funding  through  our  U.S.  and  European  commercial  paper  programs.  At  December  29,  2018,  we  had  no  commercial  paper  outstanding.  At
December  30,  2017,  we  had  commercial  paper  outstanding  of  $448  million  with  a  weighted  average  interest  rate  of  1.541%.  The  maximum  amount  of
commercial paper outstanding during the year ended December 29, 2018 was $1.1 billion.

We  maintain  our  $4.0  billion  Senior  Credit  Facility,  and  subject  to  certain  conditions,  we  may  increase  the  amount  of  revolving  commitments  and/or  add
additional  tranches  of  term  loans  in  a  combined  aggregate  amount  of  up  to  $1.0  billion.  No  amounts  were  drawn  on  our  Senior  Credit  Facility  at
December 29, 2018, at December 30, 2017, or during the years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. In June 2018, we
entered into an agreement that became effective on July 6, 2018 to extend the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 6, 2021 to July 6, 2023 and
to establish a $400 million  euro  equivalent  swing  line  facility,  which  is  available  under  the  $4.0 billion  revolving  credit  facility  limit  for  short-term  loans
denominated in euros on a same-day basis. The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of
facilities and could upon the occurrence of certain events of default restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all
financial covenants during the year ended December 29, 2018.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.

However, as previously disclosed, on March 22, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the “Original Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit
Facility, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by
us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Pursuant
to the Original Waiver, we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14, 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial
reporting, on May 10, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the “Second Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility, pursuant to which
the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us
with respect to the requirements to furnish the lenders copies of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and for the
fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  Second  Waiver  and  in  order  to  remedy  our  noncompliance,  we  are  required  to  provide  consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than
July 31, 2019. If we had not obtained these waivers, we would not have been able to access our Senior Credit Facility.

Our  long-term  debt,  including  the  current  portion,  was  $31.1 billion  at  December  29,  2018  and  $31.0 billion  at  December  30,  2017.  Our  long-term  debt
contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the year ended December 29,
2018.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants under certain indentures. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.

Under our existing indentures, if we do not file required reports within specified time periods, the trustee or holders of at least 30% in the case of our Second
Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and 25% in the case of any other series of notes may deliver a notice of default for such series of notes which would
commence the applicable cure period under such indenture. As of June 5, 2019, none of the cure periods under our existing indentures have been triggered in
connection with our failure to comply with the respective reporting covenants set forth in such indentures. However, if a cure period is triggered under such
indentures and we fail to file our annual and interim financial statements within such cure period, any outstanding notes issued thereunder would become
callable.

Our senior notes maturing in 2019 and 2020 include aggregate principal amounts of approximately $350 million in August 2019, approximately $900 million
in  February  2020,  and  approximately  800  million  Canadian  dollars  and  $1.5  billion  in  July  2020.  We  expect  to  fund  these  long-term  debt  repayments
primarily with cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities, proceeds from our divestiture in Canada, and potential new issuances of short-term
or long-term debt.

See Note 19, Debt, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information related to our long-term debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

We have utilized accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient liquidity. During
2018, we had Programs in place in various countries across the globe. In the second quarter of 2018, we unwound our U.S. securitization program, which
represented the majority of our Programs, using proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in June 2018. As of December 29, 2018, we have unwound all
of our Programs.

See  Note  17,  Financing  Arrangements,  in  Item  8,  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,  for  a  discussion  of  our  Programs  and  other  financing
arrangements.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 29, 2018 (in millions):

(a)   Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt, including interest on variable and fixed rate long-term debt. Interest on variable rate long-term debt is calculated based on

interest rates at December 29, 2018.

(b) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including expected cash payments of interest expense.

(c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(d) We have purchase obligations for materials, supplies, property, plant and equipment, and co-packing, storage, and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal
course  of  business.  Other  purchase  obligations  include  commitments  for  marketing,  advertising,  capital  expenditures,  information  technology,  and  professional  services.  Arrangements  are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction.
Several of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash
payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty
provisions for early terminations. We do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current
expectations. We exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above.

(e) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to U.S. Tax Reform, as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-
term liabilities related to income taxes, insurance accruals, and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the
timing of payments for these items.

(f) As part of the restatement described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, certain amounts

in prior years, if presented, would have been recategorized between capital leases, operating leases, and purchase

46

obligations as well as across future periods. There would have been no impact on the total future contractual obligations as of December 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

Pension plan contributions were $57 million in 2018. We estimate that 2019 pension plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Beyond 2019, we
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including
changes  in  tax,  employee  benefit,  or  other  laws  and  regulations,  tax  deductibility,  significant  differences  between  expected  and  actual  pension  asset
performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension plan contributions for 2019 have been excluded from the above table.

Postretirement benefit plan contributions were $19 million in 2018. We estimate that 2019 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately
$15 million. Beyond 2019, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. Our actual contributions and
plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences
between  expected  and  actual  postretirement  plan  asset  performance  or  interest  rates,  or  other  factors.  As  such,  estimated  postretirement  benefit  plan
contributions for 2019 have been excluded from the above table.

At December 29, 2018, the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along
with  positions  only  impacting  the  timing  of  tax  benefits,  was  approximately  $445  million.  The  timing  of  payments  will  depend  on  the  progress  of
examinations  with  tax  authorities.  We  do  not  expect  a  significant  tax  payment  related  to  these  obligations  within  the  next  year.  We  are  unable  to  make  a
reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net
unrecognized tax benefits from the above table.

Equity and Dividends

Common Stock Dividends:
We paid common stock dividends of $3.2 billion in 2018, $2.9 billion in 2017, and $3.6 billion in 2016. Additionally, on February 21, 2019, our Board of
Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which was payable on March 22, 2019 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2019.
Additionally, on May 21, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock, which is payable on June 14, 2019 to
holders of record as of May 31, 2019.

The  declaration  of  dividends  is  subject  to  the  discretion  of  our  Board  of  Directors  and  depends  on  various  factors,  including  our  net  income,  financial
condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

Series A Preferred Stock Dividends:
On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, we no longer pay any associated dividends, and there
were no such dividend payments in 2018 or 2017. Prior to the redemption, we made cash distributions of $180 million in 2016.

See Note 19, Debt, and Note 20, Capital Stock, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.

To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and
Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP
financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures
are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”), or
other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making
by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our
non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with
meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same
tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental
information  that  may  be  useful  to  investors  in  evaluating  our  results.  We  believe  that  the  presentation  of  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures,  when
considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations

47

to  those  measures,  provides  investors  with  additional  understanding  of  the  factors  and  trends  affecting  our  business  than  could  be  obtained  absent  these
disclosures.

Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We
calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela, for
which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in
comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying
operations.

Adjusted  EBITDA  is  defined  as  net  income/(loss)  from  continuing  operations  before  interest  expense,  other  expense/(income),  net,  provision  for/(benefit
from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when
they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains)
on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.,
remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that
can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes
do not directly reflect our underlying operations.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized
losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures
(e.g.,  tax  and  hedging  impacts),  nonmonetary  currency  devaluation  (e.g.,  remeasurement  gains  and  losses),  and  U.S.  Tax  Reform  discrete  income  tax
expense/(benefit), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. We believe Adjusted EPS
provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.

(a) Gross expenses included in integration and restructuring expenses were $460 million in 2018 ($396 million after-tax), $434 million in 2017 ($305 million after-tax), and $1.0 billion in 2016

($697 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line items:

•

•

Cost of products sold included $194 million in 2018, $464 million in 2017, and $699 million in 2016;

SG&A included $103 million in 2018, $119 million in 2017, and $293 million in 2016; and

• Other expense/(income), net, included expenses of $163 million in 2018, income of $149 million in 2017, and expenses of $20 million in 2016.

(b) Gross expenses included in deal costs were $23 million in 2018 ($19 million after-tax) and $30 million in 2016 ($20 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line

items:

•

•

Cost of products sold included $4 million in 2018 and $3 million in 2016; and

SG&A included $19 million in 2018 and $27 million in 2016.

(c) Gross expenses/(income) included in unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges were expenses of $21 million in 2018 ($16 million after-tax), expenses of $19 million in 2017 ($12 million

after-tax), and income of $38 million in 2016 ($25 million after-tax) and were recorded in cost of products sold.

(d) Gross expenses included in impairment losses were $15.9 billion in 2018 ($13.8 billion after-tax), $49 million in 2017 ($36 million after-tax), and $71 million in 2016 ($46 million after-tax) and

were recorded in the following income statement line items:

•

•

Cost of products sold included $53 million in 2016; and

SG&A included $15.9 billion in 2018, $49 million in 2017, and $18 million in 2016.

(e) Gross expenses included in losses/(gains) on sale of business were $15 million in 2018 ($15 million after-tax) and were recorded in SG&A.

(f) Gross expenses included in other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures were $27 million in 2018 ($15 million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line

items:

•

Interest expense included $3 million in 2018;

• Other expense/(income), net, included $17 million in 2018; and

•

Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included $7 million in 2018.

(g) Gross expenses included in nonmonetary currency devaluation were $146 million in 2018 ($146 million after tax), $36 million in 2017 ($36 million after-tax), and $28 million in 2016 ($28

million after-tax) and were recorded in the following income statement line items:

•

Cost of products sold included $4 million in 2016; and

• Other expense/(income), net, included $146 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017, and $24 million in 2016.

(h) For Adjusted EPS, we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly, we included adjustments to EPS to include $180 million Series A
Preferred Stock dividends in the first quarter of 2016 (to reflect the March 7, 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015) and to exclude $51 million of Series A
Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was redeemed on June 7, 2016).

(i) U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit) was an expense of $104 million in 2018 and a benefit of $7.0 billion in 2017. Expenses in 2018 primarily related to the revaluation of our
deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform. These expenses were partially offset by net benefits related to changes in U.S. tax reserves, U.S. Tax Reform
measurement period adjustments, changes in estimates of certain 2017 U.S. income tax deductions, and the release of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credits. The benefit in 2017 was
related to the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Supplemental Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information

The  following  unaudited  quarterly  financial  information  is  presented  to  illustrate  the  effects  of  the  corrections  of  misstatements  to  previously  reported
quarterly  financial  information  as  a  result  of  the  restatement.  Such  corrections  of  misstatements  are  described  in  more  detail  in  Note  2,  Restatement  of
Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The  following  unaudited  quarterly  financial  information  for  the  fiscal  quarters  ended  December  29,  2018  September  29,  2018,  June  30,  2018,  March  31,
2018, December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended  December  29,  2018  and  our  restated  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  December  30,  2017.  This  unaudited  quarterly
financial  information  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  other  sections  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  including  the  consolidated  financial
statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The following tables represent the unaudited reconciliation of net sales to Organic Net Sales. Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We  are  exposed  to  market  risks  from  adverse  changes  in  commodity  prices,  foreign  exchange  rates,  and  interest  rates.  We  monitor  and  manage  these
exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
reduce  the  potentially  adverse  effects  that  volatility  in  these  markets  may  have  on  our  operating  results.  We  maintain  risk  management  policies  that
principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in
commodity  prices,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  and  interest  rates.  We  manage  market  risk  by  incorporating  parameters  within  our  risk  management
strategy  that  limit  the  types  of  derivative  instruments,  the  derivative  strategies  we  use,  and  the  degree  of  market  risk  that  we  hedge  with  derivative
instruments. See Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 14, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.

When we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our
agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure
we  have  with  each  counterparty,  and  monitoring  the  financial  condition  of  our  counterparties.  All  of  our  non-exchange  traded  derivative  contracts  are
governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor
do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

56

Effect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices:
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and cross-currency swap contracts, assuming
a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions):

2018

December 30,
2017

$

100

287

It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the
value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the
prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on
debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.

Effect of Hypothetical 1% Fluctuation in LIBOR and CDOR:
Based on our current variable rate debt balance as of December 29, 2018, a hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR and CDOR would increase our annual interest
expense by approximately $19 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Kraft Heinz Company

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2018
and December 30, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 29, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a) (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the risk
assessment component of internal control, as the Company did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of material misstatement due to
changes in their business environment. The risk assessment material weakness gave rise to additional material weaknesses as the Company did not design and
maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and related arrangements or to reassess the level of precision used to review the
impairment assessments related to forecasted cash flows used within goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment calculations.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses
referred to above are described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material
weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2018 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has restated its 2017 and 2016 financial statements to correct misstatements.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it presents net periodic benefit costs in 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

58

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

Organization

The Kraft Heinz Company
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

On July 2, 2015 (the “2015 Merger Date”), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”) (the “2015 Merger”). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The
Kraft Heinz Company  (“Kraft  Heinz”).  Before  the  consummation  of  the  2015  Merger,  Heinz  was  controlled  by  Berkshire  Hathaway  Inc.  and  3G  Global
Food Holdings, LP (“3G Global Food Holdings” and together with its affiliates, “3G Capital”), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June
7, 2013.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz, as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are
eliminated.

Reportable Segments

We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada,
and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “Rest of World.” Rest of World comprises two
operating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (“APAC”).

Our  segments  reflect  a  change,  effective  in  the  first  quarter  of  our  fiscal  year  2018,  to  reorganize  our  international  businesses  to  better  align  our  global
geographies. We moved our Middle East and Africa businesses from the historical Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”) operating segment into
the historical Europe reportable segment, forming the new EMEA reportable segment. The remaining businesses from the AMEA operating segment became
the APAC operating segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. See Note 22, Segment Reporting, for our financial information
by segment.

Held for Sale

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations, predominantly in Canada and India. At December 29, 2018, we
have classified the assets and liabilities related to these disposal groups as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are
included  in  assets  held  for  sale  within  current  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  within  current  liabilities.  See  Note  5,  Acquisitions  and  Divestitures,  for
additional information.

Use of Estimates

We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  (“U.S.
GAAP”), which requires us to make accounting policy elections, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, reserves, and
expenses. These policy elections, estimates, and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections, estimates, and
assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be
reasonable  given  the  current  facts  available.  We  adjust  our  policy  elections,  estimates,  and  assumptions  when  facts  and  circumstances  dictate.  Market
volatility, including foreign currency exchange rates, increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects
cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions
in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates
and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

We made reclassifications to certain previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.

66

Note 2. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements

We have restated herein our audited consolidated financial statements at December 30, 2017 and for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31,
2016. We have also restated impacted amounts within the accompanying footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.

Restatement Background

As previously disclosed on February 21, 2019, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in October 2018 related to
our procurement area, specifically the accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to,
agreements,  side  agreements,  and  changes  or  modifications  to  agreements  with  our  suppliers.  Following  the  receipt  of  this  subpoena,  we,  together  with
external counsel and forensic accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”),
conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation, which is now
complete  and  which  identified  that  multiple  employees  in  the  procurement  area  engaged  in  misconduct,  we  corrected  prior  period  misstatements  that
generally increased the total cost of products sold in prior financial periods. These misstatements principally related to the incorrect timing of when certain
cost and rebate elements associated with supplier contracts and related arrangements were initially recognized.

In  connection  with  the  internal  investigation,  we  also  conducted  a  comprehensive  review  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements  to  identify  other
potential  misstatements  in  the  timing  of  the  recognition  of  supplier  rebates,  incentive  payments,  and  pricing  arrangements.  The  review  identified  further
misstatements, which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. These misstatements are
described in more detail in restatement reference (a) below.

Our  internal  investigation  and  review  identified  adjustments  that  resulted  in  an  understatement  of  cost  of  products  sold  totaling  $208  million,  including
misstatements  of  $175 million  relating  to  the  periods  up  through  September  29,  2018  that  are  being  restated  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  The
misstatements of cost of products sold related to our internal investigation and review included $22 million for fiscal year 2018, $94 million for fiscal year
2017, $35 million for fiscal year 2016, and $24 million for fiscal year 2015. We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period
presented in our prior financial statements. However, due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation, including the number
of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions, suppliers, and procurement employees involved, we determined that it would be
appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements. The restatement also
included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods.

Accordingly,  we  have  restated  herein  our  consolidated  financial  statements  at  December  30,  2017  and  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  December  30,  2017  and
December 31, 2016, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. In addition to
the  misstatements  related  to  the  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements,  including  the  misstatements  related  to  lease  classification  described  in
restatement reference (b) below, we corrected additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the
aggregate,  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  misstatements  were  related  to  customer  incentive  program  expense  misclassifications,  balance
sheet misclassifications, income taxes, impairments, and other misstatements, all of which are described in more detail in restatement references (c) through
(g) below.

The restated interim financial information for the relevant unaudited interim financial information for the quarterly periods ended September 29, 2018, June
30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017, is included in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Information
(Unaudited). The categories of misstatements and their impact on our previously issued consolidated financial statements are described in more detail below.

67

Description of Misstatements

Misstatements Associated with Supplier Contracts and Related Arrangements

(a) Supplier Rebates

We recorded adjustments to correct the misstatements found as a result of the internal investigation related to procurement described above. In connection
with  the  internal  investigation,  we  also  conducted  a  comprehensive  review  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements  to  identify  other  potential
misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates, incentive payments, and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements,
which  we  also  investigated  and  have  been  unable  to  conclude  if  they  resulted  from  the  misconduct  described  above.  These misstatements were primarily
related to certain supplier contracts and related arrangements where the allocation of value of all or a portion of rebates and up-front payments to contractual
elements in the current period should have been deferred and recognized over an applicable contractual period. We corrected these misstatements to defer the
up-front consideration from suppliers when the retention or receipt of that consideration was contingent upon future events and to correctly recognize the
consideration as a reduction of cost of products sold over the terms of the arrangements with the suppliers. The impacts of the supplier rebate misstatements
on each period are discussed in restatement reference (a) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

(b) Capital Leases

As part of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements in connection with the internal investigation, we evaluated additional elements of such
arrangements, including the classification of embedded lease provisions as capital or operating. We had initially classified certain embedded lease provisions
as capital leases and allocated their fixed consideration to the lease components. As a result of our analysis, and also taking into consideration, among other
elements,  the  total  value  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements,  we  determined  that  the  classification  of  the  embedded  lease  element  for  certain
contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition, we identified certain arrangements that were improperly
accounted for as embedded capital leases. The impacts of the capital lease misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (b) throughout
this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

Additional Misstatements

(c) Customer Incentive Program Expense Misclassifications

As previously disclosed in March 2018, we retrospectively corrected immaterial misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer
incentive  program  expense  misclassifications.  The  impacts  of  the  customer  incentive  program  expense  misclassifications  on  each  period  are  discussed  in
restatement reference (c) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

(d) Balance Sheet Misclassifications

We recorded adjustments to recognize certain balance sheet misclassifications in the correct period. These adjustments primarily related to the classification
of state income taxes, capital expenditures, and the classification of products held at co-packer locations. The impacts of the balance sheet misclassifications
on each period are discussed in restatement reference (d) throughout this note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

(e) Income Taxes

We recorded adjustments to recognize certain income tax items in the correct period, primarily deferred tax adjustments related to a Brazilian subsidiary, as
well as return-to-provision adjustments and various other misclassifications. The income tax impacts of all misstatements outside of this category are included
in their respective misstatement categories. The impacts of income tax misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (e) throughout this
note and in Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

(f) Impairments

We recorded an adjustment to recognize certain non-cash impairment losses in the correct period. In 2018, we had determined that a definite-lived intangible
asset had been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a license termination in that period and recorded an out-of-period correction to recognize the non-
cash impairment loss. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to correct goodwill impairment losses related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit,
which had been overstated. The impacts of the impairment misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (f) throughout this note and in
Note 23, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

68

(g) Other

We recorded adjustments to correct other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to
our  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  other  misstatements  were  primarily  related  to  structured  payable  and  product  financing  arrangements,
postemployment benefit plans, inventory write-offs, certain accrued liabilities, and other misstatements within net sales and certain income tax and balance
sheet  accounts.  The  impacts  of  the  other  misstatements  on  each  period  are  discussed  in  restatement  reference  (g)  throughout  this  note  and  in  Note  23,
Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited).

Description of Restatement Tables

The following tables represent our restated consolidated statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, statements of equity, and statements of
cash flows for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, as well as our restated consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2017.

Following the restated consolidated financial statement tables, we have presented a reconciliation from our prior periods as previously reported to the restated
values.  The  values  as  previously  reported  for  fiscal  years  2017  and  2016  were  derived  from  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended
December 30, 2017 filed on February 16, 2018.

In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of accounting standards
update (“ASU”) 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter
of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The
restated statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2017-07 and are labeled “As Recast.” See Note 4,
New Accounting Standards, for additional information related to our adoption of ASU 2017-07.

The $36 million decrease to net income was primarily driven by the misstatements in the other, supplier rebates, and impairments categories, partially offset
by the misstatements in the income taxes category. See additional descriptions of the net income impacts in the consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December 31, 2016 section above.

The $7 million increase to foreign currency translation adjustments is primarily the result of misstatements in the balance sheet misclassifications and the
other misstatements categories, partially offset by misstatements in the income taxes category.

The $66 million decrease to prior service credits arising during the period and the $3 million increase to net postemployment benefit gains reclassified to net
income are the result of misstatements in the other category.

which resulted in a decrease to net income for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, which has been reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital
rather than retained earnings due to certain dividends declared in 2015 without a corresponding amount in retained earnings.

The $55 million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive losses at January 3, 2016 was primarily driven by the misstatements in the other and income
taxes categories, partially offset by the misstatements in the balance sheet reclassifications category.

See  descriptions  of  the  net  income  and  other  comprehensive  income  impacts  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  income  and  consolidated  statement  of
comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016 sections above.

Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition:
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled
when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration, including consumer incentives and performance obligations related
to trade promotions, excluding taxes, and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that
occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions
to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We
recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.

Advertising, Consumer Incentives, and Trade Promotions:
We  promote  our  products  with  advertising,  consumer  incentives,  and  performance  obligations  related  to  trade  promotions.  Consumer  incentives  and  trade
promotions include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, performance-based in-store display activities, and volume-based incentives. Variable
consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to
customers  and  consumers  at  the  end  of  a  period.  We  base  these  estimates  principally  on  historical  utilization,  redemption  rates,  and/or  current  period
experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.

Advertising expenses are recorded in SG&A. For interim reporting purposes, we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales
activity and marketing costs. We review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information. We recorded advertising
expenses  of  $584  million  in  2018,  $629  million  in  2017,  and  $708  million  in  2016,  which  represented  costs  to  obtain  physical  advertisement  spots  in
television, radio, print, digital, and social channels. We also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as shopper marketing, sponsorships, and agency
advertisement conception, design, and public relations fees. Total advertising and marketing costs were $1,140 million in 2018, $1,115 million in 2017, and
$1,221 million in 2016.

Research and Development Expense:
We expense costs as incurred for product research and development within SG&A. Research and development expenses were approximately $109 million in
2018, $93 million in 2017, and $120 million in 2016.

Stock-Based Compensation:
We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which is generally five years. These
costs are primarily recognized within SG&A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity
award  compensation  costs.  We  classify  equity  award  compensation  costs  primarily  within  general  corporate  expenses.  See  Note  12,  Employees’  Stock
Incentive Plans, for additional information.

Postemployment Benefit Plans:
We  maintain  various  retirement  plans  for  the  majority  of  our  employees.  These  include  pension  benefits,  postretirement  health  care  benefits,  and  defined
contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on, among other things, the cost component and whether
the  plan  is  active  or  inactive.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  our  plan  assets  result  in  net  actuarial  gains  or  losses.  These  net  actuarial  gains  and  losses  are
deferred  into  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(losses)  and  amortized  within  other  expense/(income),  net  in  future  periods  using  the  corridor
approach. The corridor is 10% of the greater of the market-related value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation. Any actuarial gains and losses in
excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive. See Note 13, Postemployment Benefits, for
additional information.

82

Income Taxes:
We  recognize  income  taxes  based  on  amounts  refundable  or  payable  for  the  current  year  and  record  deferred  tax  assets  or  liabilities  for  any  difference
between  the  financial  reporting  and  tax  basis  of  our  assets  and  liabilities.  We  also  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  for  temporary  differences,  operating  loss
carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and
expectations  about  future  outcomes.  Realization  of  certain  deferred  tax  assets,  primarily  net  operating  loss  and  other  carryforwards,  is  dependent  upon
generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods.

We  apply  a  more-likely-than-not  threshold  to  the  recognition  and  derecognition  of  uncertain  tax  positions.  Accordingly,  we  recognize  the  amount  of  tax
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate
resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect our results in the quarter of such change.

We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation
allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in
judgment  about  the  realizability  of  deferred  tax  assets  in  future  years,  we  would  adjust  related  valuation  allowances  in  the  period  that  the  change  in
circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in
valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period, but is not expected to be material to our financial position.

Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends:
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit, dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
capital.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash  equivalents  include  demand  deposits  with  banks  and  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less.  Cash  and  cash
equivalents  that  are  legally  restricted  as  to  withdrawal  or  usage  is  classified  in  other  current  assets  or  other  non-current  assets,  as  applicable,  on  the
consolidated balance sheets.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories primarily using the average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery
and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from three to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years. Capitalized software
costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed
seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
Such  conditions  could  include  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  business  climate,  current-period  operating  or  cash  flow  losses,  significant  declines  in
forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating
cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash
flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be
disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

83

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:
Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units, and our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands. We
test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained
decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to
regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant brands or components of our business, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural
disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), unexpected significant declines in operating results, or significant adverse
changes  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  We  test  reporting  units  for  impairment  by  comparing  the  estimated  fair  value  of  each  reporting  unit  with  its
carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a
reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, in the
case of reporting units, not to exceed to the associated carrying amount of goodwill.

Definite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  periods  benefited.  We  review  definite-lived  intangible  assets  for
impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse
changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an
asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.
When  testing  for  impairment  of  definite-lived  intangible  assets  held  for  use,  we  group  assets  at  the  lowest  level  for  which  cash  flows  are  separately
identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.

Financial Instruments:
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad, we use a variety of risk management
strategies  and  financial  instruments  to  manage  commodity  price,  foreign  currency  exchange  rate,  and  interest  rate  risks.  Our  risk  management  program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our
operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy, we do not use
highly leveraged derivative instruments, nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value, which fluctuates based on changing market conditions.

Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others are not designated as hedging instruments and
are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss), in the same line item as the underlying hedged
item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement
line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain
foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our
non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method, with changes reported in foreign currency translation
adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until
the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated
as  net  investment  hedges  is  recognized  in  net  income/(loss)  within  interest  expense.  The  income  statement  classification  of  gains  and  losses  related  to
derivative  instruments  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  is  determined  based  on  the  underlying  intent  of  the  contracts.  Cash  flows  related  to  the
settlement  of  derivative  instruments  designated  as  net  investment  hedges  of  foreign  operations  are  classified  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows
within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged
item, which is generally within operating activities.

84

To qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at
inception  and  maintained  throughout  the  hedged  period.  When  a  hedging  instrument  no  longer  meets  the  specified  level  of  hedging  effectiveness,  we
reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income within other expense/(income), net.
We formally document our risk management objectives, our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, the nature of and relationships between
the hedging instruments and hedged items, and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions, we
specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will
not occur, the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in net income in the current period.

Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within
general  corporate  expenses  until  realized.  Once  realized,  the  gains  and  losses  are  included  within  the  applicable  segment  operating  results.  See  Note
14, Financial Instruments, for additional information.

Our designated and undesignated derivative contracts include:

•

•

•

•

Net  investment  hedges.  We  have  numerous  investments  in  our  foreign  subsidiaries,  the  net  assets  of  which  are  exposed  to  volatility  in  foreign
currency  exchange  rates.  We  manage  this  risk  by  utilizing  derivative  and  non-derivative  instruments,  including  cross-currency  swap  contracts,
foreign exchange contracts, and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-
currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness.
We recognize the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts in net income/(loss) within interest expense. We amortize the forward points on
foreign exchange contracts into net income/(loss) within interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship.

Foreign currency cash flow hedges. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and
intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling, euro,
and Canadian dollar. These instruments include cross-currency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Substantially all
of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency
swap contracts and the forward points and option premiums or discounts on foreign exchange contracts from the assessment and measurement of
hedge  effectiveness  and  amortize  such  amounts  into  net  income/(loss)  in  the  same  line  item  as  the  underlying  hedged  item  over  the  life  of  the
hedging relationship.

Interest rate cash flow hedges. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of our interest rate risk
management strategy. We have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future
debt obligations.

Commodity  derivatives.  We  are  exposed  to  price  risk  related  to  forecasted  purchases  of  certain  commodities  that  we  primarily  use  as  raw
materials.  We  enter  into  commodity  purchase  contracts  primarily  for  dairy  products,  meat  products,  coffee  beans,  sugar,  vegetable  oils,  wheat
products,  corn  products,  and  cocoa  products.  These  commodity  purchase  contracts  generally  are  not  subject  to  the  accounting  requirements  for
derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures, options, and
swaps to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs, including the commodities noted above, as well as packaging products, diesel
fuel, and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments. We also occasionally use futures to economically cross
hedge a commodity exposure.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on
the balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period.

85

Highly Inflationary Accounting:
We  apply  highly  inflationary  accounting  if  the  cumulative  inflation  rate  in  an  economy  for  a  three-year  period  meets  or  exceeds  100%.  Under  highly
inflationary  accounting,  the  financial  statements  of  a  subsidiary  are  remeasured  into  our  reporting  currency  (U.S.  dollars)  based  on  the  legally  available
exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities
are reflected in net income/(loss), rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no
longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We apply highly
inflationary  accounting  to  the  results  of  our  subsidiaries  in  Venezuela  and  Argentina.  The  net  monetary  assets  of  our  subsidiary  in  Argentina  were
approximately  $2  million  at  December  29,  2018.  See  Note  16,  Venezuela  -  Foreign  Currency  and  Inflation,  for  additional  information  related  to  our
subsidiary in Venezuela.

Note 4. New Accounting Standards

Accounting Standards Adopted in the Current Year

Presentation of Net Periodic Benefit Costs:
In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension
and  postretirement  cost).  This  ASU  became  effective  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  our  fiscal  year  2018.  Under  the  new  guidance,  the  service  cost
component  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  must  be  presented  in  the  same  statement  of  income  line  item  as  other  employee  compensation  costs  arising  from
services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in
the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income/(loss) subtotal. Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for
capitalization in assets. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively for the statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net
periodic  benefit  cost  components  and  prospectively  for  the  capitalization  of  service  cost  components.  There  is  a  practical  expedient  that  allows  us  to  use
historical amounts disclosed in our Postemployment Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the statement of income presentation
requirements. In  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  adopted  this  ASU  using  the  practical  expedient  described  above.  There  was  no  impact  to  our  consolidated
balance sheet at December 30, 2017 or to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December  31,  2016. See
Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for the impacts on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended
December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, companies must apply a
five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the  company  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  The  ASU  may  be  applied  using  a  full  retrospective  method  or  a  modified
retrospective  transition  method,  with  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  as  of  the  date  of  adoption.  The  ASU  also  provides  for  certain  practical  expedients,
including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if the contract period is for one year or less. This ASU was effective
beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method and the practical
expedient described above. Upon adoption, we made the following policy elections: (i) we account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment
costs, and (ii) we exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g., sales, use, and value added taxes) from the
transaction price. The impact of adopting this guidance was immaterial to our financial statements and related disclosures.

Income Tax Impacts of Certain Intercompany Transfers:
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax accounting impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, such as
intellectual property and property, plant and equipment. Under the new accounting guidance, current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon
transfer of the assets. Previously, recognition of current and deferred income taxes was prohibited until the asset was sold to an external party.  This  ASU
became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this new guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-
effect adjustment of $95 million to decrease retained earnings in the first quarter of 2018.

Definition of a Business Clarification:
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 clarifying the definition of a business used in determining whether transactions should be accounted for as
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU provides a screen for companies to determine if an integrated set of assets and activities (“set”) is
not a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of
similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. If this screen is not met, the entity then determines if the set meets the minimum requirement of a business.
For a set to be a business, it must include an input and a substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. This ASU
became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. We adopted this ASU on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not impact
our financial statements or related disclosures.

Goodwill Impairment Test Simplification:
In  January  2017,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2017-04  related  to  goodwill  impairment  testing.  This  ASU  eliminates  Step  2  from  the  goodwill  impairment  test.
Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the entity will record an impairment loss based on that difference. The
impairment loss will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Previously, if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its
carrying amount (Step 1), an entity was required to calculate any impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount
(Step  2).  Additionally,  under  the  new  standard,  companies  that  have  reporting  units  with  zero  or  negative  carrying  amounts  will  no  longer  be  required  to
perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, reporting units with zero or negative
carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however, additional disclosure will be required of those companies. We
early  adopted  this  guidance  on  a  prospective  basis  as  of  April  1,  2018  (our  annual  impairment  testing  date  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018).  As  a  result  of
adopting this ASU, we no longer perform Step 2 while completing our goodwill impairment testing, beginning with our annual goodwill impairment testing
in the second quarter of 2018.

Accounting for Hedging Activities:
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance impacted the accounting for financial (e.g., foreign
exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (e.g., commodity) hedging activities. We early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis in the
third quarter of 2018. Upon adoption, we recognized an insignificant cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit). The most significant impacts
of adoption are that we now:

•

•

•

Recognize changes in the fair value of excluded components in net income/(loss) in the current period or in other comprehensive income/(loss) (and
then amortize into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship);
Defer changes in the spot rate of the hedging instrument into other comprehensive income/(loss), while the excluded component (i.e., forward points
or  option  premiums  or  discounts)  is  amortized  into  net  income/(loss)  over  the  life  of  the  hedging  relationship.  When  the  excluded  component  is
released or the forecasted transaction occurs, it is recognized in the same income statement line item affected by the hedged item; and
Present additional details in our tabular disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements.

Additionally, ASU 2017-12 eliminated the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; therefore, we removed disclosures related to
hedge  ineffectiveness.  See  our  consolidated  statements  of  other  comprehensive  income,  Note  3,  Significant  Accounting  Policies,  Note  14,  Financial
Instruments, and Note 15, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses), for updated disclosures pursuant to ASU 2017-12.

87

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

Leases:
In  February  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-02  to  establish  the  principles  that  lessees  and  lessors  shall  apply  to  report  useful  information  to  users  of
financial  statements  about  the  amount,  timing,  and  uncertainty  of  cash  flows  arising  from  a  lease.  The  updated  guidance  requires  lessees  to  reflect  the
majority of leases on their balance sheets as assets and obligations. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early
adoption  is  permitted.  The  guidance  must  be  adopted  using  a  modified  retrospective  transition  method.  The  ASU  also  provides  for  certain  practical
expedients. Among the practical expedients is an optional transition method that allows companies to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) on the adoption date. We plan to elect this practical expedient upon adoption. We also plan to elect
the package of practical expedients that will allow us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists, the classification of a lease, and whether
initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard. We do not expect to use the hindsight practical expedient. We do plan to elect the
land easement option, which will allow us to continue to use prior accounting conclusions reached in our accounting for land easements. We also plan to elect
the short-term lease exemption whereby we will not record an asset or liability for short-term leases. We have completed our scoping reviews, identified our
significant leases by geography and by asset type, and developed our accounting policies and expected policy elections, which will take effect upon adoption
of  the  standard.  We  have  executed  our  lease  data  extraction  strategy  and  completed  data  extraction  efforts.  Our  identified  accounting  system,  which  will
support the future state leasing process, is also ready for implementation. We have completed our future state process design as part of the overall system
implementation. Upon adoption, we expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements.
We expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that, upon adoption, we will have total lease assets
between approximately $750 million and $910 million and total lease liabilities between approximately $810 million and $990 million. We will adopt this
ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019.

Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses:
In  June  2016,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2016-13  to  update  the  methodology  used  to  measure  current  expected  credit  losses  (“CECL”). This  ASU  applies  to
financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, and trade accounts receivable as well
as  certain  off-balance  sheet  credit  exposures,  such  as  loan  commitments.  This  ASU  replaces  the  current  incurred  loss  impairment  methodology  with  a
methodology to reflect CECL and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates. The
guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period
of adoption. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the
impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017. U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to
21.0%. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be
presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However, the related tax effects of such deferred tax assets and liabilities may have been originally
recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss). This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional, and if elected, may be applied either to the period of adoption or
retrospectively  to  the  period(s)  impacted  by  U.S.  Tax  Reform. Additionally,  this  ASU  requires  companies  to  disclose  the  policy  election  for  stranded  tax
effects as well as the general accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). This ASU will be
effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this ASU on the first day of our fiscal year 2019 and
will  make  the  policy  election  to  reclassify  stranded  tax  effects  from  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(losses)  to  retained  earnings/(deficit).  We
currently estimate the increase to retained earnings/(deficit) upon adoption will be between approximately $130 million and $140 million.

88

Fair Value Measurement Disclosures:
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of
and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred, and valuation processes
for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value
measurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing
requirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, including the amount and location of
unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in
determining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance
in whole is permitted. Alternatively, companies may early adopt removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their
effective date. Certain of the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively upon adoption, while other amendments must be applied retrospectively
upon adoption. We elected to early adopt the provisions related to removing disclosures in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018 on a retrospective basis.
Accordingly, we have removed information related to our valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements for pension plan investments within Note 13,
Postemployment Benefits. We also removed information about the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy from
Note  14,  Financial Instruments.  There  was  no  other  impact  to  our  financial  statement  disclosures  as  a  result  of  early  adopting  the  provisions  related  to
removing disclosures. We are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of the provisions related to modifying and adding disclosures as well as the timing of
adoption.

Disclosure Requirements for Certain Employer-Sponsored Benefit Plans:
In  August  2018,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2018-14  related  to  the  disclosure  requirements  for  employers  that  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension  and  other
postretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures, including weighted-average interest rates used in
the company’s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period.
Additionally, this guidance eliminates certain previous disclosure requirements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year
2020. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact this
ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption.

Implementation Costs Incurred in Hosted Cloud Computing Service Arrangements:
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements.
Under the new guidance, implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the
nature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization, they must be amortized
over  the  term  of  the  hosting  arrangement  and  assessed  for  impairment.  Companies  must  disclose  the  nature  of  any  hosted  cloud  computing  service
arrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of
cash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted,
including in an interim period. This guidance may be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of
adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption and
the application method.

Note 5. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Cerebos Acquisition

On  March  9,  2018  (the  “Acquisition  Date”),  we  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  equity  interests  in  Cerebos  Pacific  Limited  (“Cerebos”)  (the  “Cerebos
Acquisition”),  an  Australian  food  and  beverage  company  with  several  local  brands  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  The  Cerebos  business  manufactures,
markets,  and  sells  food  and  beverage  products,  including  gravies,  sauces,  instant  coffee,  salt,  herbs  and  spices,  and  tea.  Cerebos  is  included  in  our
consolidated financial statements as of the Acquisition Date. We have not included unaudited pro forma results, prepared in accordance with ASC 805, as if
Cerebos had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, as it would not yield significantly different results.

The Cerebos Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The total consideration paid for Cerebos
was $244 million. We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such allocation was final as of December 29, 2018.

The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cerebos Acquisition was (in millions):

We  valued  trademarks  using  the  relief  from  royalty  method  and  customer-related  assets  using  the  distributor  method.  Some  of  the  more  significant
assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales,
cost  of  products  sold,  selling  and  marketing  costs,  and  working  capital/contributory  asset  charges),  the  discount  rate  that  appropriately  reflects  the  risk
inherent  in  each  future  cash  flow  stream,  the  assessment  of  each  asset’s  life  cycle,  and  competitive  trends,  as  well  as  other  factors.  We  determined  the
assumptions  used  in  the  financial  forecasts  using  historical  data,  supplemented  by  current  and  anticipated  market  conditions,  estimated  product  category
growth rates, management plans, and market comparables.

We  used  carrying  values  as  of  the  Acquisition  Date  to  value  trade  receivables  and  payables,  as  well  as  certain  other  current  and  non-current  assets  and
liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at the Acquisition Date.

We valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach. Raw materials and packaging inventory was valued using the
replacement cost approach.

We valued property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income approach, the market approach, and the cost approach, which is based on the
current replacement and/or reproduction cost of the asset as new, less depreciation attributable to physical, functional, and economic factors.

We incurred deal costs of $18 million in 2018 related to the Cerebos Acquisition.

Other Acquisitions

In the third quarter of 2018, we had two additional acquisitions of businesses, including The Ethical Bean Coffee Company Ltd., a Canadian-based coffee
roaster,  and  Wellio,  Inc.,  a  full-service  meal  planning  and  preparation  technology  start-up  in  the  U.S.  The  aggregate  consideration  paid  related  to  these
acquisitions was $27 million.

In  November  2018,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  a  third  party  to  acquire  all  of  the  outstanding  equity  interests  in  Primal  Nutrition,  LLC
(“Primal Nutrition”) for approximately $200 million (the “Primal Acquisition”). Primal Nutrition is a better-for-you brand primarily focused on condiments,
sauces, and dressings, with growing product lines in healthy snacks and other categories. The brand holds leading positions in the e-commerce and natural
channels. The Primal Acquisition closed on January 3, 2019.

We incurred aggregate deal costs related to other acquisitions of $2 million in 2018.

90

Divestitures

In May 2018, we sold our 50.1% interest in our South African subsidiary to our minority interest partner. The transaction included proceeds of $18 million,
which are included in other investing activities, net on the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2018. We recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of business of
approximately $15 million. The pre-tax loss was included in SG&A on the consolidated statement of income for 2018.

In  October  2018,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  Zydus  Wellness  Limited  and  Cadila  Healthcare  Limited  (collectively,  the  “Buyers”)  to
sell 100% of our equity interests in Heinz India Private Limited (“Heinz India”) for approximately 46 billion Indian rupees (approximately $660 million at
December 29, 2018) (the “Heinz India Transaction”). In connection with the Heinz India Transaction, we will transfer to the Buyers, among other assets and
operations,  our  global  intellectual  property  rights  to  several  brands,  including  Complan, Glucon-D, Nycil,  and  Sampriti.  Our  core  brands  (i.e.,  Heinz  and
Kraft) will not be transferred. The Heinz India Transaction closed on January 30, 2019. We expect to recognize a gain on this transaction upon closing. We
have presented the assets and liabilities related to the Heinz India Transaction as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018. This
divestiture  is  not  considered  a  strategic  shift  that  will  have  a  major  effect  on  our  operations  or  financial  results;  therefore,  it  will  not  be  reported  as
discontinued operations.

We  entered  into  foreign  exchange  derivative  contracts  to  economically  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exposure  related  to  the  Heinz  India  Transaction.
Additionally, we entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges related to our investment in Heinz India.
See Note 14, Financial Instruments, for additional information. We also recorded changes in our deferred tax liabilities related to the Heinz India Transaction.
See Note 11, Income Taxes, for additional information.

Additionally, in November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Parmalat SpA (“Parmalat”) to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio
in Canada for approximately 1.6 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $1.2 billion at December 29, 2018) (the “Canada Natural Cheese Transaction”). In
connection  with  the  Canada  Natural  Cheese  Transaction,  we  will  transfer  certain  assets  to  Parmalat,  including  the  intellectual  property  rights  to  Cracker
Barrel in Canada and P’Tit Quebec  globally.  While  this  transaction  is  contingent  on  customary  closing  conditions,  we  expect  the  Canada  Natural  Cheese
Transaction to be finalized in mid-2019. We expect to recognize a gain on this transaction upon closing. We have presented the assets and liabilities related to
the Canada Natural Cheese Transaction as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018. This divestiture is not considered a strategic
shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, it will not be reported as discontinued operations.

Note 6. Integration and Restructuring Expenses

As part of our restructuring activities, we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee
benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity
award compensation expense, and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur
expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S.
GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment
charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities, professional fees, asset relocation costs, costs to exit facilities, and
costs associated with restructuring benefit plans.

Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements,
or  historical  benefit  practices.  We  recognize  the  contractual  component  of  these  benefits  when  payment  is  probable  and  estimable;  additional  elements  of
severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee’s required future service period. Charges
for  accelerated  depreciation  are  recognized  on  long-lived  assets  that  will  be  taken  out  of  service  before  the  end  of  their  normal  service,  in  which  case
depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held
for disposal or sale, and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as
incurred.

Integration Program:
At the end of 2017, we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the “Integration Program”), which was
designed to reduce costs and integrate and optimize our combined organization, primarily in the U.S. and Canada segments. Overall, as part of the Integration
Program, we closed net six factories, consolidated our distribution network, and eliminated 4,900 positions. Approximately 65% of total Integration Program
costs were reflected in cost of products sold, and approximately 60% were cash expenditures.

As of December 29, 2018, we had incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of $2,146 million, including $92 million in 2018, $316 million in 2017, and $887 million
in 2016. The $2,146 million  of  cumulative  pre-tax  costs  included  $541 million  of  severance  and  employee  benefit  costs,  $889 million  of  non-cash  asset-
related  costs,  $609 million  of  other  implementation  costs,  and  $107 million  of  other  exit  costs.  The  related  amounts  incurred  in  2018  were  $2 million  of
severance and employee benefit costs, $32 million of non-cash asset-related costs, $59 million of other implementation costs, and $1 million  of  credits  in
other exit costs.

Our cumulative pre-tax costs related to the Integration Program, as well as the associated costs for the year ended December 30, 2017, reflect the restatements
described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 29, 2018, we do not expect to incur significant additional expenses related to the Integration Program.

Our liability balance for Integration Program costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs) was (in millions):

The Integration Program liability at December 29, 2018 relates to the elimination of salaried positions in Canada. We expect the majority of this liability to be
paid by the end of 2019.

Restructuring Activities:
In addition to our Integration Program in North America, we have other restructuring programs globally, which are focused primarily on workforce reduction,
factory closure and consolidation, and benefit plan restructuring. Related to these programs, we expect to eliminate approximately 1,900 positions, 1,400 of
which were eliminated in 2018. These programs resulted in expenses of $368 million in 2018, including $48 million of severance and employee benefit costs,
$63  million  of  non-cash  asset-related  costs,  $251  million  of  other  implementation  costs,  and  $6  million  of  other  exit  costs.  Other  implementation  costs
included a non-cash settlement charge related to the settlement of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans in 2018. See Note
13, Postemployment Benefit Plans, for additional information. Other restructuring program expenses totaled $118 million in 2017 and $125 million in 2016.

Our liability balance for restructuring project costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP (i.e., severance and employee benefit costs and
other exit costs) was (in millions):

We expect the liability for severance and employee benefit costs as of December 29, 2018 to be paid by the end of 2019. The liability for other exit costs
primarily relates to lease obligations. The cash impact of these obligations will continue for the duration of the lease terms, which expire between 2019 and
2026.

Goodwill at December 30, 2017 reflects the restatements described in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the first quarter of 2018, we reorganized our segment structure to move our Middle East and Africa businesses from the Rest of World segment to the
EMEA reportable segment. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. Accordingly, the segment goodwill balances at December 30,
2017 reflect an increase of $179 million in EMEA and a corresponding decrease in Rest of World. This change did not have a material impact on our current
or any prior period results. See Note 22, Segment Reporting, for additional information.

See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to our acquisitions in 2018, as well as assets held for sale at December 29, 2018
related to the Canada Natural Cheese Transaction and the Heinz India Transaction.

Our goodwill balance consists of 20 reporting units and had an aggregate carrying amount of $36.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. We test our reporting
units for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We performed our 2018 annual impairment test as of April 1, 2018. We utilized the discounted
cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a
non-cash impairment loss of $133 million in SG&A related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit within our Rest of World segment primarily due
to anticipated and sustained margin declines in the region. The goodwill carrying amount of this reporting unit was $509 million prior to its impairment.

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  our  year-end  financial  statements,  we  assessed  the  changes  in  circumstances  that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units were below their carrying amounts. Although
our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.

95

While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of seven of our 20 reporting units, including U.S. Grocery, U.S. Refrigerated, Canada Retail,
Australia  and  New  Zealand,  Northeast  Asia,  Southeast  Asia,  and  Other  Latin  America,  were  below  their  carrying  amounts.  These  factors  included:  (i)  a
sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018, which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the
completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs
and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018, which provided additional insights into
expectations  and  priorities  for  the  coming  years,  such  as  lower  growth  and  margin  expectations;  (iv)  the  announcement  in  November  2018  to  sell  certain
assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada, which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit;
(v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations, including an increase in the United States in
December 2018; and (vii) increased and prolonged economic and regulatory uncertainty in the United States and global economies as of the end of December
2018.

As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these seven reporting units were below their carrying amounts, we performed an
interim  impairment  test  on  these  reporting  units  as  of  December  29,  2018.  After  assessing  the  totality  of  circumstances,  we  determined  that  each  of  the
remaining 13 reporting units was unlikely to have a fair value below carrying amount.

As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $6.9 billion in SG&A related to five reporting units, including U.S. Refrigerated,
Canada Retail, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and Other Latin America. The other two reporting units we tested were determined to not be impaired. We
utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Drivers of these impairment losses, by
reporting unit, were as follows:

• We recognized a $4.1 billion impairment loss in our U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit within our United States segment due to revised 2019 base and
future year margin expectations, primarily in the natural cheese and meats categories, and, to a lesser extent, expectations for lower long-term net
sales growth in the natural and processed cheese categories. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases
in  supply  chain  costs,  expectations  for  lower  pricing  to  maintain  competitive  positioning,  and  expectations  for  increased  marketing  investments,
primarily in response to private label competition, as well as customer-driven packaging investments. Changes in expectations for lower long-term
net sales growth were primarily due to sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations
were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual
operating  plan  in  December  2018.  Additionally,  our  revised  expectations  were  based  on  the  development  of  our  global  five-year  operating  plan,
which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The goodwill carrying amount of the U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit
was $11.3 billion prior to its impairment.

• We recognized a $1.9 billion impairment loss in our Canada Retail reporting unit within our Canada segment due to lower positive net sales growth
expectations  and  revised  2019  base  and  future  year  margin  expectations,  as  well  as  the  reassessment  of  our  Canadian  operations  following  the
announcement in November to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada. We revised our net sales growth expectations primarily
due to our expected exit of the natural cheese category and expected declines in the coffee category (exclusive of our coffee business acquisition in
Canada  in  2018).  Our  revised  expectations  were  based  on  the  completion  of  our  fourth  quarter  results,  which  were  below  management’s
expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily
driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs and expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning. The goodwill carrying
amount of the Canada Retail reporting unit was $4.0 billion prior to its impairment.

• We recognized a $315 million impairment loss in our Southeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales
declines  in  the  seafood  and  seasonal  cordials  categories  and  foreign  exchange  rate  declines  in  Indonesia  and  Papua  New  Guinea.  Our  revised
expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our
2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. This impairment represents all of the goodwill of the Southeast Asia reporting unit.

• We recognized a $302 million impairment loss in our Northeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales
declines as well as foreign exchange rate declines in Japan and Korea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter
results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. The goodwill
carrying amount of the Northeast Asia reporting unit was $391 million prior to its impairment.

96

• We recognized a $207 million impairment loss in our Other Latin America reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to net sales and
margin declines in the region. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s
expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. This impairment represents all of the goodwill of the Other
Latin America reporting unit.

The goodwill carrying amounts associated with an additional four reporting units, which each had excess fair value over its carrying amount of 20% or less,
were $18.5 billion for U.S. Grocery, $424 million for Latin America Exports, $404 million for Southeast Europe, and $367 million for Australia and New
Zealand as of December 29, 2018.

Accumulated impairment losses to goodwill were $7.0 billion at December 29, 2018.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair  value  of  individual  reporting  units  requires  us  to  make  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  our  future  plans,  as  well  as  industry,  economic,  and
regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and
other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates,
change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the development of our global five-year operating plan, then one
or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. Our reporting units that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair
values  resulting  in  zero  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  2018  impairment  testing  dates.  Accordingly,  these  and  other  individual
reporting units that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any
assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future.  Reporting  units  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  had  an  aggregate  goodwill
carrying amount of $29.0 billion  at  December  29,  2018  and  included:  U.S.  Grocery,  U.S.  Refrigerated,  Canada  Retail,  Latin  America  Exports,  Southeast
Europe,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  Northeast  Asia.  Of  the  $29.0 billion  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments,  $9.3 billion  is  attributable  to
reporting units with 0% excess fair value over carrying amount. Although the remaining reporting units have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying
amount  as  of  their  latest  2018  impairment  testing  date,  these  amounts  are  also  associated  with  the  2013  Heinz  acquisition  and  the  2015  Merger  and  are
recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore, if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors change in the future,
these amounts are also susceptible to impairments.

in India. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information on assets held for sale at December 29, 2018 related to the Canada Natural
Cheese Transaction and the Heinz India Transaction.

Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands, which had an aggregate carrying amount of $44.0 billion as
of December 29, 2018. We test our brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a brand is less than its carrying amount. We performed our 2018 annual impairment test as of April 1,
2018. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $101 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2018. This
impairment loss was due to net sales and margin declines related to the Quero brand in Brazil, which was valued using the relief from royalty method. The
impairment loss was recorded in our Rest of World segment, consistent with the ownership of the trademark.

In the third quarter of 2018, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $215 million in SG&A related to the Smart Ones brand, which was valued using
the relief from royalty method. This impairment loss was primarily due to reduced future investment expectations and continued sales declines in the third
quarter  of  2018.  The  impairment  loss  was  recorded  in  our  United  States  segment,  consistent  with  the  ownership  of  the  trademark.  We  transferred  the
remaining carrying amount of Smart Ones to definite-lived intangible assets due to a shift in future investments to other brands in the frozen and chilled foods
category.

97

For  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  our  year-end  financial  statements,  we  assessed  the  changes  in  circumstances  that
occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any brands were below their carrying amounts. Although our
annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we perform this qualitative assessment each interim reporting period.

While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2018 led us
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of six of our brands, including Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Cool Whip, and
ABC, were below their carrying amounts. These factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. As
we  determined  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  values  of  these  six  brands  were  below  their  carrying  amounts,  we  performed  an  interim
impairment test on these brands as of December 29, 2018. After assessing the totality of circumstances, we determined that each of the remaining brands was
unlikely to have a fair value below its carrying amount.

As a result of our interim test, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $8.6 billion in SG&A related to five brands, including three that were valued
using the excess earnings method (Kraft, Oscar Mayer, and Philadelphia) and two that were valued using the relief from royalty method (Velveeta and ABC).
The other brand we tested was determined to not be impaired. The impairment losses for Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, and Velveeta were recorded in our
United States segment, and the ABC impairment loss was recorded in our Rest of World segment, consistent with the ownership of each trademark. Drivers of
these impairment losses, by brand, were as follows:

• We recognized a $4.3 billion impairment loss related to the Kraft brand, primarily due to lower long-term net sales growth expectations in the natural
cheese category in the United States, lower net sales growth expectations in the processed cheese category in the United States and Canada, and the
exit of the natural cheese category in Canada announced in November 2018. Changes in expectations for lower net sales growth were primarily due
to distribution losses driven by sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations were
based  on  the  completion  of  our  fourth  quarter  results,  which  were  below  management’s  expectations,  and  the  development  of  our  2019  annual
operating  plan  in  December  2018.  Additionally,  our  revised  expectations  were  based  on  the  development  of  our  global  five-year  operating  plan,
which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Kraft brand was $15.9 billion prior to its
impairment.

• We recognized a $3.3 billion impairment loss related to the Oscar Mayer brand, primarily due to revised 2019 annual and future margin expectations
in the United States. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs, expectations for
lower  pricing  to  maintain  competitive  positioning,  and  expectations  for  increased  marketing  investments  and  customer-driven  packaging
investments. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and
the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our
global five-year operating plan, which commenced in November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Oscar
Mayer brand was $6.6 billion prior to its impairment.

• We  recognized  a  $797  million  impairment  loss  related  to  the  Philadelphia  brand,  primarily  due  to  revised  2019  annual  and  future  margin
expectations,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  lower  future  positive  net  sales  growth  expectations  in  the  United  States.  Changes  in  future  year  margin
expectations  were  primarily  driven  by  sustained  increases  in  supply  chain  costs  and  expectations  for  lower  pricing  to  maintain  competitive
positioning, as well as unfavorable changes in product mix and customer-driven packaging investments. Our revised expectations were based on the
completion of our fourth quarter results, which were below management’s expectations, and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in
December 2018. Additionally, our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan, which commenced in
November 2018 and we expect to be completed in 2019. The carrying amount of the Philadelphia brand was $6.7 billion prior to its impairment.

• We recognized a $168 million impairment loss related to the Velveeta brand, primarily due to expectations for lower long-term net sales growth due

to anticipated trends in consumer preferences. The carrying amount of the Velveeta brand was $2.5 billion prior to its impairment.

• We recognized an $84 million impairment loss related to the ABC brand, primarily due to revised expectations of future net sales growth and margins
in the seafood and seasonal cordials categories in Southeast Asia as well as foreign exchange rates in the regions in which this brand is sold. The
carrying amount of the ABC brand was $357 million prior to its impairment.

The aggregate carrying amount associated with an additional six brands (Miracle Whip, Planters, A1,  Cool  Whip, Stove Top, and Quero),  which  each  had
excess fair value over its carrying amount of 20% or less, was $5.8 billion as of December 29, 2018.

98

As a result of our 2017 annual impairment testing, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $49 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2017. This
loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in India. The loss was recorded in our EMEA segment as the related trademark is owned by an
Italian subsidiary.

Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the
fair  value  of  individual  brands requires  us  to  make  assumptions  and  estimates  regarding  our  future  plans,  as  well  as  industry,  economic,  and  regulatory
conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty
rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of
our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of the development of our global
five-year operating plan, then one or more of our brands might become impaired in the future. Our brands that were impaired in 2018 were written down to
their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, these and
other  individual  brands  that  have  20%  or  less  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  as  of  their  latest  testing  date  have  a  heightened  risk  of  future
impairments  if  any  assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future.  Brands  with  a  heightened  risk  of  future  impairments  had  an  aggregate
carrying amount of $29.3 billion at December 29, 2018 and included: Kraft, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Miracle Whip, Planters, A1, Cool Whip,
Stove Top, ABC, and Quero. Of the $29.3 billion with a heightened risk of future impairments, $24.0 billion is attributable to brands with 0% excess fair value
over carrying amount. Although the remaining brands have more than 20% excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing
date,  these  amounts  are  also  associated  with  the  2013  Heinz  acquisition  and  the  2015  Merger  and  are  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  at  their  estimated
acquisition  date  fair  values.  Therefore,  if  any  assumptions,  estimates,  or  market  factors  change  in  the  future,  these  amounts  are  also  susceptible  to
impairments.

Financial Statements.

Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $290 million in 2018, $278 million in 2017, and $267 million in 2016. Aside from amortization
expense, the changes in definite-lived intangible assets from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018 primarily reflect the reclassification to assets held for
sale of $96 million, additions of $100 million  related  to  purchase  accounting  for  Cerebos,  transfers  of  $72 million  from  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,
impairment losses of $3 million, and foreign currency. The impairment of definite-lived intangible assets in 2018 related to a trademark which had a carrying
amount that was deemed not to be recoverable. This non-cash impairment loss was recognized in SG&A. Definite-lived intangible assets reclassified to assets
held for sale included customer-related assets in Canada and India and certain trademarks, including P’Tit Quebec in Canada. See Note 5, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerebos in 2018, as well as our assets held for sale at December 29, 2018.

We estimate that amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $284 million in 2019 and approximately $274 million
in each of the four fiscal years thereafter.

Note 11. Income Taxes

U.S. Tax Reform:
On December 22, 2017, U.S. Tax Reform legislation was enacted by the federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax laws by, among
other  things,  lowering  the  federal  corporate  tax  rate  from  35.0%  to  21.0%,  effective  January  1,  2018  and  imposing  a  one-time  toll  charge  on  deemed
repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017. In addition, there were many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation,
revised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax
(“BEAT”),  and  a  deduction  for  foreign-derived  intangible  income  (“FDII”).  While  the  corporate  tax  rate  reduction  was  effective  January  1,  2018,  we
accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017, the period of enactment.

99

Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the SEC in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax
Reform  and  allowed  for  provisional  estimates  when  actual  amounts  could  not  be  determined.  As  of  December  30,  2017,  we  had  made  estimates  of  our
deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change, the toll charge, certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
including depreciation and executive compensation, and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, we reassessed
our  international  investment  assertion  and  no  longer  consider  the  historic  earnings  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  as  of  December  30,  2017  to  be  indefinitely
reinvested. We made an estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. Additionally, we elected to
account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus did not adjust any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for U.S. Tax
Reform.

Our initial accounting for U.S. Tax Reform as of December 30, 2017 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion, including an estimate of our
deferred income tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion related to the corporate rate change, which was partially offset by an estimate of $312 million for
the toll charge and approximately $125 million for other tax expenses, including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Related to our indefinite
reinvestment assertion change, we had recorded an estimate of deferred tax liabilities of $96 million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings as of
December 30, 2017.

In  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  we  recorded  a  measurement  period  adjustment  to  reduce  income  tax  expense  and  reduce  deferred  tax  liabilities  each  by
approximately $20 million. We also recorded insignificant measurement period adjustments in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2018.

As of December 29, 2018, we had finalized our accounting for U.S. Tax Reform. The final impact (the majority of which was recorded in 2017, the period of
enactment) was a net tax benefit of approximately $7.1 billion, including a deferred tax benefit of approximately $7.5 billion  related  to  the  corporate  rate
change, partially offset by tax expense of $224 million related to the toll charge and $120 million for other tax expenses, including the deferred tax liability
recorded for changing our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion change, we had a deferred tax liability of $111
million on approximately $1.2 billion of historic earnings as of December 30, 2017.

Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $33 million as of December 29, 2018 to reflect our investment in an Indian subsidiary that is no longer
considered to be indefinitely reinvested. At the same time, we reversed $28 million of deferred tax liabilities related to local withholding tax obligations. As
of December 29, 2018, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $78 million on $1.2 billion of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will
be owed when this cash is distributed.

We  consider  the  unremitted  current  year  earnings  of  certain  international  subsidiaries  that  impose  local  country  taxes  on  dividends  to  be  indefinitely
reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. The amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately
$20 million.

Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments recorded directly to additional paid-in capital totaled $30 million in 2016. In
the  first  quarter  of  2017,  we  prospectively  adopted  ASU  2016-09.  We  now  record  tax  benefits  related  to  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  other  equity
instruments within our tax provision, rather than within equity. Accordingly, we recognized a tax benefit in our statements of income of $12 million in 2018
and $22 million in 2017 related to tax benefits upon the exercise of stock options and other equity instruments.

The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly,
the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally, the calculation of
the  percentage  point  impact  of  U.S.  Tax  Reform,  tax  exempt  income,  and  other  items  on  the  effective  tax  rate  shown  in  the  table  above  are  affected  by
income/(loss)  before  income  taxes.  Fluctuations  in  the  amount  of  income  generated  across  locations  around  the  world  could  impact  comparability  of
reconciling items between periods. Additionally, small movements in tax rates due to a change in tax law or a change in tax rates that causes us to revalue our
deferred tax balances produces volatility in our effective tax rate.

The 2018 effective tax rate was lower, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate, non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments,
nonmonetary currency devaluation losses, and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans), the impact of the federal tax on GILTI, and the revaluation of our
deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform, which were partially offset by the benefit from intangible asset impairment
losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information related to our impairment losses in the fourth
quarter of 2018.

The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017. The related income tax benefit of 129.0% in 2017
primarily reflects adjustments to our deferred tax positions for the lower federal income tax rate, partially offset by our provision for the one-time toll charge.

The tax provision for the 2016 tax year included a benefit related to the tax effect of statutory tax rate changes, including a benefit related to the impact on
deferred taxes of a 10-basis-point reduction in the state tax rate and a 100-basis-point statutory rate reduction in the United Kingdom.

At December 29, 2018, deferred income tax liabilities excluded amounts classified as held for sale. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional
information.

The decrease in deferred tax liabilities from December 30, 2017 to December 29, 2018 was primarily driven by intangible asset impairment losses recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.

At December 29, 2018, foreign operating loss carryforwards totaled $307 million. Of that amount, $26 million expire between 2019 and 2038; the other $281
million do not expire. We have recorded $86 million of deferred tax assets related to these foreign operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets of $90
million have been recorded for U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards. These losses expire between 2019 and 2038.

Uncertain Tax Positions:
At December 29, 2018, our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions were $387 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the impact on
our effective tax rate would have been $352 million. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $54 million in
the next 12 months primarily due to the progression of federal, state, and foreign audits in process. Our unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions
are included in income taxes payable and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Our unrecognized tax benefits decreased during 2018 mainly as a result of audit settlements with federal, state, and foreign taxing authorities and statute of
limitations  expirations.  Our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  increased  during  2017  as  a  result  of  evaluating  tax  positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  on  our
federal, state, and foreign income tax returns.

In 2016, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving all Kraft open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 through 2014. This settlement
reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions and resulted in a non-cash tax benefit of $42 million.

We include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. Our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes included a $5 million
expense in 2018, $24 million benefit in 2017, and $8 million expense in 2016 related to interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $62 million
as of December 29, 2018 and $57 million as of December 30, 2017.

Other Income Tax Matters:
In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia,
Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of December 29, 2018, we have substantially concluded all national income
tax matters through 2016 for the Netherlands, through 2014 for the United States, through 2012 for the United Kingdom, through 2011 for Australia, Canada,
and  Italy.  We  have  substantially  concluded  all  state  income  tax  matters  through  2007.  Additionally,  as  of  April  2019,  we  had  substantially  concluded  all
national income tax matters through 2015 for the United States.

We have a tax sharing agreement with Mondelēz International, Inc. (“Mondelēz International”), which generally provides that (i) we are liable for U.S. state
income taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012 and (ii) Mondelēz International is responsible for
U.S. federal income taxes and substantially all non-U.S. income taxes, excluding Canadian income taxes, for Kraft periods prior to October 1, 2012.

Kraft's U.S. operations were included in Mondelēz International's U.S. federal consolidated income tax returns for tax periods through October 1, 2012. In
December 2016, Mondelēz International reached a final resolution on a U.S. federal income tax audit of the 2010-2012 tax years. As noted above, we are
indemnified for U.S. federal income taxes related to these periods.

Note 12. Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans

We grant equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”), to select employees to provide long-
term performance incentives to our employees. As a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently
eligible to use Form S-8 registration statements.

Stock Plans

We had activity related to equity awards from the following plans in 2018, 2017, and 2016:

2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
In  April  2016,  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  2016  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan  (“2016  Omnibus  Plan”),  which  authorized  grants  of  options,  stock
appreciation rights, RSUs, deferred stock, performance awards, investment rights, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. This plan authorizes the
issuance of up to 18 million shares of our common stock. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan generally have a five-year cliff vest period,
and non-qualified stock options have a maximum exercise term of 10 years. Equity awards granted under the 2016 Omnibus Plan since inception include non-
qualified stock options, RSUs, and PSUs.

103

2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan:
Prior  to  approval  of  the  2016  Omnibus  Plan,  we  issued  non-qualified  stock  options  to  select  employees  under  the  2013  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan  (“2013
Omnibus Plan”). As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following
this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. Non-qualified stock options awarded under
the 2013 Omnibus Plan have a five-year cliff vest period and a maximum exercise term of 10 years. These non-qualified stock options will continue to vest
and become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2013 Omnibus Plan and the relevant award agreements.

Kraft 2012 Performance Incentive Plan:
Prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued equity-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the
2015 Merger, each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option
adjustment  ratio,  and  each  outstanding  Kraft  RSU  was  converted  into  one  Kraft  Heinz  RSU.  These  Kraft  Heinz  equity  awards  will  continue  to  vest  and
become exercisable in accordance with the terms and conditions that were applicable immediately prior to the completion of the 2015 Merger. These options
generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date, and have a maximum exercise term of
10 years. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan,
vesting generally accelerates for holders of Kraft awards who are terminated without cause within two years of the 2015 Merger Date.

In addition, prior to the 2015 Merger, Kraft issued performance-based, long-term incentive awards (“Performance Shares”), which vested based on varying
performance,  market,  and  service  conditions.  In  connection  with  the  2015  Merger,  all  outstanding  Performance  Shares  were  converted  into  cash  awards,
payable in two installments: (i) a 2015 pro-rata payment based upon the portion of the Performance Share cycle completed prior to the 2015 Merger and (ii)
the remaining value of the award to be paid on the earlier of the first anniversary of the closing of the 2015 Merger and a participant's termination without
cause.

The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date, with a remaining term equal to the expected life of
the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data, we calculated
expected life using the Safe Harbor method, which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2018, we estimated
volatility using a blended volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. In 2017
and 2016, we estimated volatility using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. We calculated peer volatility as the average of the term-
matched, leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co., The Coca-Cola Company, Mondelēz International, Altria Group, Inc., PepsiCo,
Inc., and Unilever plc. We estimated the expected dividend yield using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price, annualized and
continuously compounded.

RSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the plan and the applicable award agreement.

We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs are not dividend-eligible. We discounted the fair value
of  these  RSUs  based  on  the  dividend  yield.  Dividend  yield  was  estimated  using  the  quarterly  dividend  divided  by  the  three-month  average  stock  price,
annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period.

The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our RSUs granted during the year was $58.59 in 2018, $91.25 in 2017, and $77.53  in  2016.  Our

Performance Share Units

PSUs represent a right to receive one share or the value of one share upon the terms and conditions set forth in the plan and the applicable award agreement
and are subject to achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

We used the stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of our PSUs. None of our PSUs are dividend-eligible; therefore, we discounted the fair
value of our PSUs based on the dividend yield. Dividend yield was estimated using the quarterly dividend divided by the three-month average stock price,
annualized and continuously compounded. The grant date fair value of PSUs is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We adjust the expense based on
the likelihood of future achievement of performance metrics.

The weighted average grant date fair value per share of our PSUs granted during the year was $56.31 in 2018 and $79.85 in 2017. Our expected dividend
yield was 3.31% in 2018 and 2.73% in 2017. There were no PSUs granted in 2016.

Note 13. Postemployment Benefits

As  noted  above,  as  a  result  of  the  failure  to  remain  current  in  our  reporting  requirements  with  the  SEC,  we  are  not  currently  eligible  to  use  Form  S-8
registration  statements.  As  a  result,  on  April  23,  2019,  the  administrator  of  the  Kraft  Heinz  Savings  Plan  and  the  Kraft  Heinz  Union  Savings  Plan
(collectively, the “Plan”) issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during which participants are prohibited from acquiring
beneficial  ownership  of  additional  interests  in  The  Kraft  Heinz  Company  Stock  Fund.  If  we  are  not  able  to  become  and  remain  current  in  our  reporting
requirements with the SEC, it restricts our ability to maintain The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund or issue other equity securities to our employees.

We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic
union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with
the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized, non-union
hourly, and salaried employees as well as certain employees in foreign locations.

We provide health care and other postretirement benefits to certain of our eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. Certain of our U.S. and
Canadian employees may become eligible for such benefits. We may modify plan provisions or terminate plans at our discretion. The postretirement benefits
of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment.

We remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annually.

We capitalize a portion of net pension and postretirement cost/(benefit) into inventory based on our production activities. Beginning January 1, 2018, only the
service  cost  component  of  net  pension  and  postretirement  cost/(benefit)  is  capitalized  into  inventory.  As  part  of  the  adoption  of  ASU  2017-07  in  the  first
quarter of 2018, we recognized a one-time favorable credit of $42 million within cost of products sold related to amounts that were previously capitalized into
inventory. Included in this credit was $28 million related to prior service credits that were previously capitalized to inventory.

Pension Plans

In 2018, we settled our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, which resulted in settlement charges of $162 million for the
year ended December 29, 2018. Additionally, the settlement of these plans impacted the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, fair
value of plan assets, and service costs associated with our non-U.S. pension plans.

We  had  approved  the  wind-up  of  the  Canadian  salaried  and  Canadian  hourly  defined  benefit  pension  plans  in  2016,  and  the  wind-up  was  effective  on
December 31, 2016. This action resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligations of approximately $85 million at December 31, 2016. This action
had no impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $4.1 billion at December 29, 2018 and $4.7 billion  at
December 30, 2017 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $1.7 billion at December 29, 2018 and
$3.3 billion at December 30, 2017.

The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in net pension assets of $918 million at December 29, 2018 and $758 million at December 30, 2017.

Discount rates for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that
match  the  expected  future  cash  flows  of  the  plans.  We  determine  our  expected  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  from  the  plan  assets'  historical  long-term
investment performance, target asset allocation, and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

Plan Assets:
The  underlying  basis  of  the  investment  strategy  of  our  defined  benefit  plans  is  to  ensure  that  pension  funds  are  available  to  meet  the  plans’  benefit
obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the security
of  the  funds;  achieving  an  optimal  return  on  plan  assets  within  specified  risk  tolerances;  and  investing  according  to  local  regulations  and  requirements
specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long
term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash
flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for
the selection of investment managers, procedures to monitor overall investment performance as well as investment manager performance. It also provides
guidelines enabling the applicable plan fiduciaries to fulfill their responsibilities.

Our pension investment strategy for U.S. plans is designed to align our pension assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an
investment  of  approximately  85%  of  our  U.S.  plan  assets  in  fixed-income  securities  and  approximately  15%  in  return-seeking  assets,  primarily  equity
securities.

For  pension  plans  outside  the  United  States,  our  investment  strategy  is  subject  to  local  regulations  and  the  asset/liability  profiles  of  the  plans  in  each
individual country. In aggregate, the long-term asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 65% fixed-
income securities and annuity contracts, and approximately 35% in return-seeking assets, primarily equity securities and real estate.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets, including an indication of the level in the
fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.

Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally
corporate  bonds).  Such  investments  are  valued  through  consultation  and  evaluation  with  brokers  in  the  institutional  market  using  quoted  prices  and  other
observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2.

Government  Bonds.  These  securities  consist  of  direct  investments  in  publicly  traded  U.S.  fixed  interest  obligations  (principally  debentures).  Such
investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are included in Level 1.

Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing
price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. This consists of direct cash holdings and institutional short-term investment vehicles. Direct cash holdings are valued based on
cost, which approximates fair value and are classified as Level 1. Certain institutional short-term investment vehicles are valued daily and are classified as
Level 1. Other cash equivalents that are not traded on an active exchange, such as bank deposits, are classified as Level 2.

Real Estate. These holdings consist of real estate investments and are generally classified as Level 3.

Certain Insurance Contracts. This category consists of group annuity contracts that have been purchased to cover a portion of the plan members and have
been classified as Level 3.

Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds, short-term investments and partnership/corporate feeder interests.

• Pooled funds.  The  fair  values  of  participation  units  held  in  collective  trusts  are  based  on  their  net  asset  values,  as  reported  by  the  managers  of  the
collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The
fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed
on  each  business  day  based  upon  the  applicable  net  asset  value  per  unit.  Investments  in  the  international  large/mid  cap  equity  collective  trust  can  be
redeemed on the last business day of each month and at least one business day during the month.

The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange, and a majority of these funds are held in a separate account managed by a fixed income
manager. The fair values of these investments are based on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of
actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset
value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The objective of the account is to provide superior return with reasonable risk, where performance is
expected to exceed Barclays Long U.S. Credit Index. Investments in this account can be redeemed with a written notice to the investment manager.

110

• Short-term investments. Short-term investments largely consist of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported
by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net
asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive
yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level
of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.

• Partnership/corporate feeder interests. Fair value estimates of the equity partnership are based on their net asset values, as reported by the manager of the
partnership.  The  fair  value  of  these  investments  measured  at  net  asset  value  is  excluded  from  the  fair  value  hierarchy.  Investments  in  the  equity
partnership may be redeemed once per month upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the General Partner, subject to the discretion of the General Partner.
The investment objective of the equity partnership is to seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities.

The  fair  values  of  the  corporate  feeder  are  based  upon  the  net  asset  values  of  the  equity  master  fund  in  which  it  invests.  The  fair  value  of  these
investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the corporate feeder can be redeemed quarterly with at
least 90 days’ notice. The investment objective of the corporate feeder is to generate long-term returns by investing in large, liquid equity securities with
attractive fundamentals.

Employer Contributions:
In  2018,  we  contributed  $57  million  to  our  non-U.S.  pension  plans.  We  did  not  contribute  to  our  U.S.  pension  plans.  We  estimate  that  2019  pension
contributions will be approximately $15 million to our non-U.S. plans. We do not plan to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2019. Our actual
contributions  and  plans  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  changes  in  tax,  employee  benefit,  or  other  laws  and  regulations,  tax  deductibility,
significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.

Discount rates for our plans were developed from a model portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the plans. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs and our expectation for health care cost trend rates going
forward.

The year that the health care cost trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate varies by plan and ranges between 2019 and 2030 as of December 29, 2018.

Assumed health care costs trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. A one-percentage-point change

The amortization of prior service credits was primarily driven by plan amendments in 2015 and 2016. We estimate that amortization of prior service credits
will be approximately $306 million in 2019, $122 million in 2020, $8 million in 2021, $6 million in 2022, and $6 million in 2023.

In 2017, we remeasured certain of our postretirement plans and recognized a curtailment gain of $177 million. The curtailment was triggered by the number
of cumulative headcount reductions after the closure of certain U.S. factories during the year. The resulting gain is attributed to accelerating a portion of the
previously deferred actuarial gains and prior service credits. The headcount reductions and factory closures were part of our Integration Program. See Note 6,
Integration and Restructuring Expenses, for additional information.

In  December  2017,  we  made  a  cash  contribution  of  approximately  $1.2  billion  to  pre-fund  a  portion  of  our  U.S.  postretirement  plan  benefits  following
enactment of U.S. Tax Reform on December 22, 2017. The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our U.S. postretirement plans is to ensure that funds
are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they are due by investing plan assets in a high-quality, diversified manner in order to maintain the
security of the funds. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities, while fixed-
income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans’ benefit payment cash flow requirements.

Our postretirement benefit plan investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Our
investment strategy is designed to align our postretirement benefit plan assets with our postretirement benefit obligation to reduce volatility. In aggregate, our
long-term  asset  allocation  targets  are  broadly  characterized  as  a  mix  of  approximately  70%  in  fixed-income  securities  and  approximately  30%  in  return-
seeking assets, primarily equity securities.

The  fair  value  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plan  assets  was  $1.2  billion  at  December  30,  2017.  These  assets  were  all  classified  as  Level  1  short-term
investments.

The following section describes the valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of postretirement benefit plan assets, including an indication of
the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.

Corporate Bonds and Other Fixed-Income Securities. These securities consist of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations (principally
corporate bonds an tax-exempt municipal bonds). Such investments are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market
using quoted prices and other observable market data. As such, these securities are included in Level 2.

Government  Bonds.  These  securities  consist  of  direct  investments  in  publicly  traded  U.S.  fixed  interest  obligations  (principally  debentures).  Such
investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets. These securities are included in Level 1.

Equity Securities. These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing
price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.

Investments Measured at Net Asset Value. This category consists of pooled funds and short-term investments.

• Pooled funds.  The  fair  values  of  participation  units  held  in  collective  trusts  are  based  on  their  net  asset  values,  as  reported  by  the  managers  of  the
collective trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close to the financial statement date. The
fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in the collective trusts can be redeemed
on  each  business  day  based  upon  the  applicable  net  asset  value  per  unit.  Investments  in  the  international  large/mid  cap  equity  collective  trust  can  be
redeemed on the last business day of each month and at least one business day during the month.

The mutual fund investments are not traded on an exchange. The fair values of the mutual fund investments that are not traded on an exchange are based
on their net asset values, as reported by the managers and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions occurring as of or close
to the financial statement date. The fair value of these investments measured at net asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy.

114

• Short-term investments. Short-term investments largely consist of a money market fund, the fair value of which is based on the net asset value reported
by the manager of the fund and supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The fair value of these investments measured at net
asset value is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The money market fund is designed to provide safety of principal, daily liquidity, and a competitive
yield by investing in high quality money market instruments. The investment objective of the money market fund is to provide the highest possible level
of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.

Employer Contributions:
In  2018,  we  contributed  $19  million  to  our  postretirement  benefit  plans.  We  estimate  that  2019  postretirement  benefit  plan  contributions  will  be
approximately $15 million. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws
and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.

Future Benefit Payments:
Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement plans at December 29, 2018 were (in millions):

determined  by  the  matching  of  employee  contributions,  as  defined  by  the  plans.  Amounts  charged  to  expense  for  defined  contribution  plans  totaled  $85
million in 2018, $78 million in 2017, and $74 million in 2016.

As of December 29, 2018, we expect to amortize $306 million of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits from accumulated other comprehensive
income/(losses) into net postretirement benefit plans costs/(benefits) during 2019. We do not expect to amortize any other significant postemployment benefit
losses/(gains) into net pension or net postretirement benefit plan costs/(benefits) during 2019.

Note 14. Financial Instruments

All of our non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement, and these master
agreements and their schedules contain certain obligations regarding the delivery of certain financial information upon demand.

Derivative Volume:
The notional values of our outstanding derivative instruments were (in millions):

Commodity contracts

Foreign exchange contracts

Cross-currency contracts

$

478   $

3,263

10,146

2,876

3,161

The increase in our derivative volume for cross-currency contracts was primarily driven by the addition of new Canadian dollar and British pound sterling
cross-currency swaps. A portion of these new contracts is being used to offset existing cross-currency contracts that are no longer designated as hedging
instruments. The remaining portion of the new contracts is designated as net investment hedges.

116

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments:
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy of derivative instruments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
were (in millions):

(b) The fair value of our derivative assets was recorded in other non-current assets.

(c) The fair value of derivative assets was recorded in other current assets and the fair value of derivative liabilities was recorded in other current liabilities.

Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early
termination of the contract. We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. If the
derivative financial instruments had been netted on the consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $124
million at December 29, 2018 and $23 million  at  December  30,  2017.  At  December  29,  2018, collateral of $32 million  was  posted  related  to  commodity
derivative margin requirements. This was included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018.

Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities.

117

Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity swaps, foreign exchange forwards, options, and swaps, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity
swaps are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
Foreign exchange forwards and swaps are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the
notional amount. Foreign exchange options are valued using an income approach based on a Black-Scholes-Merton formula. This formula uses present value
techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on observable market rates. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot
and swap rates.

We did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities in any period presented.

Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.

Net Investment Hedging:
At December 29, 2018, we had the following items designated as net investment hedges:

•

•

•

Non-derivative foreign denominated debt with principal amounts of €2,550 million and £400 million;

Cross-currency contracts with notional amounts of £1.0 billion ($1.4 billion), C$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion), and ¥9.6 billion ($85 million); and

Foreign exchange contracts, including contracts denominated in:

◦ Chinese renminbi with an aggregate notional amount of $127 million,

◦ Euros with an aggregate notional amount of $264 million, and

◦ Indian rupees with an aggregate notional amount of $279 million.

The  component  of  the  gains  and  losses  on  our  net  investment  in  these  designated  foreign  operations,  driven  by  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  are
economically offset by fair value movements on the effective portion of our cross-currency contracts and foreign exchange contracts and remeasurements of
our foreign denominated debt.

Interest Rate Hedging:
From time to time we have had derivatives designated as interest rate hedges, including interest rate swaps. We no longer have any outstanding interest rate
swaps.  We  continue  to  amortize  the  realized  hedge  losses  that  were  deferred  into  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(losses)  into  interest  expense
through the original maturity of the related long-term debt instruments.

Cash Flow Hedge Coverage:
At December 29, 2018, we had entered into foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next 12 months and into
cross-currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods not exceeding the next five years.

Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses on Cash Flow Hedges:
Based on our valuation at December 29, 2018 and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss)
of unrealized gains for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be approximately $32 million. Additionally, we expect transfers to net
income/(loss) of unrealized losses for interest rate cash flow hedges and cross-currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant.

Concentration of Credit Risk:
Counterparties to our foreign exchange derivatives consist of major international financial institutions. We continually monitor our positions and the credit
ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses
due  to  the  credit  risk  of  non-performance  by  these  counterparties,  losses  are  not  anticipated.  We  closely  monitor  the  credit  risk  associated  with  our
counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses.

Economic Hedging:
We enter into certain derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with our risk management strategy which have an economic
impact of largely mitigating commodity price risk and foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses are recorded in net income/(loss) as a component of cost
of products sold for our commodity contracts and other expense/(income), net for our cross currency and foreign exchange contracts.

118

Divestiture Hedging:
We  entered  into  foreign  exchange  derivative  contracts  to  economically  hedge  the  foreign  currency  exposure  related  to  the  Heinz  India  Transaction.  The
related derivative losses were $20 million, including $17 million recorded within other expense/(income), net, and $3 million recorded within interest expense
for the year ended December 29, 2018. These losses are classified as other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures. Additionally, we entered into
foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges related to our investment in Heinz India. Related to these net investment hedges,
we had unrealized hedge losses of $10 million, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). See Note 5, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, for additional information related to the Heinz India Transaction.

Note 16. Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation

We  have  a  subsidiary  in  Venezuela  that  manufactures  and  sells  a  variety  of  products,  primarily  in  the  condiments  and  sauces  and  infant  and  nutrition
categories.  We  apply  highly  inflationary  accounting  to  the  results  of  our  Venezuelan  subsidiary  and  include  these  results  in  our  consolidated  financial
statements.  Under  highly  inflationary  accounting,  the  functional  currency  of  our  Venezuelan  subsidiary  is  the  U.S.  dollar  (the  reporting  currency  of  Kraft
Heinz), although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result, we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S.
dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average DICOM (as defined below) rates, and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary
assets  and  liabilities  at  the  period-end  DICOM  spot  rate.  The  resulting  revaluation  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  current  net  income/(loss),  rather  than
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(losses).  These  gains  and  losses  are  classified  within  other  expense/(income),  net  as  nonmonetary  currency
devaluation on our consolidated statements of income.

In February 2018, the Venezuelan government eliminated the official exchange rate, which was available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida (“DIPRO”)
for purchases and sales of certain essential items, including food products. At December 30, 2017, we had outstanding invoice reimbursement requests of $26
million related to the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015. Following the elimination of this preferential rate, we
determined that these outstanding requests, which were approved by the Venezuelan government, were no longer collectible. There was no impact on our
consolidated statements of income for 2018.

123

Following  elimination  of  the  DIPRO  rate,  the  Sistema  de  Divisa  Complementaria  (“DICOM”)  is  the  only  foreign  currency  exchange  mechanism  legally
available  to  us  for  converting  Venezuelan  bolivars  to  U.S.  dollars.  As  of  December 29, 2018,  we  believe  the  DICOM  rate  is  the  most  appropriate  legally
available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to monitor the DICOM rate, and the nonmonetary assets supported
by the underlying operations in Venezuela, for impairment.

The auction-based DICOM system was temporarily frozen in September 2017 and reopened in February 2018. The last published DICOM rate before the
auction freeze was BsF3,345 per U.S. dollar compared to BsF25,000 per U.S. dollar upon reopening. In August 2018, the Venezuelan government changed
the unit for measuring bolivars from the bolivar fuerte (“BsF”) to the bolivar soberano (“BsS”). The conversion ratio is BsF100,000 to BsS1. Upon converting
to the bolivar soberano measurement unit, the Venezuelan government further devalued the currency. On August 20, 2018, the published DICOM rate was
BsF6,000,000 (BsS60.00) per U.S. dollar compared to approximately BsF249,000 (BsS2.49) per U.S. dollar immediately preceding the conversion to BsS.

The DICOM rate at December 29, 2018 was BsS638.18 per U.S. dollar compared to BsS0.03 at December 30, 2017. We remeasured the bolivar denominated
assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at December 29, 2018 using the DICOM spot rate of BsS638.18 per U.S. dollar. We remeasured the income
statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary using a weighted average rate of BsS25.06 in 2018, BsS0.02 in 2017, and BsS0.01 in 2016. Remeasurements of the
monetary assets and liabilities and operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary at DICOM rates resulted in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses of
$146 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017, and $24 million in 2016. These losses were recorded in other expense/(income), net in the consolidated statements
of income.

Additionally, in the second quarter of 2016, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, resulting in a $53 million loss
to write down property, plant and equipment, net, and prepaid spare parts, which was recorded within cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of
income in 2016.

We  did  not  obtain  any  U.S.  dollars  at  DICOM  rates  during  2018.  In  addition  to  DICOM,  there  is  an  unofficial  market  for  obtaining  U.S.  dollars  with
Venezuelan bolivars. The exact exchange rate is widely debated but is generally accepted to be substantially higher than the latest published DICOM rate. We
have not transacted at any unofficial market rates and have no plans to transact at unofficial market rates in the foreseeable future.

Our Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through exports and royalty payments. These U.S. dollars are primarily used for purchases of tomato paste
and spare parts for manufacturing, as well as a limited amount of other operating costs. As of December 29, 2018, our Venezuelan subsidiary has sufficient
U.S.  dollars  to  fund  these  operational  needs  in  the  foreseeable  future.  However,  further  deterioration  of  the  economic  environment  or  regulation  changes
could  jeopardize  our  export  business.  Our  Venezuelan  subsidiary  has  increasingly  sourced  production  inputs  locally,  including  tomato  paste  and  sugar,  in
order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.

Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to control our
operations. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving government controls over imports, prices, currency exchange, and
payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic
environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. We
currently do not expect to make any new investments or contributions into Venezuela.

Note 17. Financing Arrangements

We have utilized accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the “Programs”) globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient
liquidity. During 2018, we had Programs in place in various countries across the globe. In the second quarter of 2018, we unwound our U.S. securitization
program, which represented the majority of our Programs, using proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in June 2018. As of December 29, 2018, we
have unwound all of our Programs.

We operated the Programs such that we generally utilized the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We accounted for transfers of
receivables  pursuant  to  the  Programs  as  a  sale  and  removed  them  from  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Under  the  Programs,  we  generally  received  cash
consideration up to a certain limit and recorded a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintained a “beneficial
interest,” or a right to collect cash, in the sold receivables. Cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables (which are cash receipts on the underlying
trade receivables that have already been securitized in these Programs) are classified as investing activities and presented as cash receipts on sold receivables
on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

124

The carrying value of trade receivables removed from our consolidated balance sheets in connection with the Programs was $1.0 billion  at  December  30,
2017.  In  exchange  for  the  sale  of  trade  receivables,  we  received  cash  of  $673  million  at  December  30,  2017  and  recorded  sold  receivables  of  $353
million at December 30, 2017. There were no such balances at December 29, 2018.  The  carrying  value  of  sold  receivables  approximated  the  fair  value  at
December 30, 2017.

We acted as servicer for certain of the Programs. We did not record any related servicing assets or liabilities as of December 30, 2017 because they were not
material to the financial statements.

Our U.S. securitization program utilized a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity (“SPE”). The SPE was wholly-owned by a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz,
and its sole business consisted of the purchase or acceptance, through capital contributions, of receivables and related assets from a Kraft Heinz subsidiary
and the subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank. Although the SPE is included in our consolidated financial statements, it was a
separate legal entity with separate creditors who were entitled, upon its liquidation in the second quarter of 2018, to be satisfied out of the SPE's assets prior
to any assets or value in the SPE becoming available to Kraft Heinz or its subsidiaries.

Additionally, we enter into various structured payable and product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification
is  based  on  the  nature  of  the  agreements.  For  certain  arrangements,  we  classify  amounts  outstanding  within  other  current  liabilities  on  our  consolidated
balance  sheets.  We  had  approximately  $267  million  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  at  December  29,  2018  and  approximately  $268  million  at
December 30, 2017 related to these arrangements.

Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections, or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of
our business. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we do
not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.

Class Actions and Stockholder Derivative Actions:
We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in three securities class action lawsuits filed in February, March, and
April 2019. The first filed action, Hedick v. The Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on February 24, 2019 against the Company and three of its officers (the
“Hedick  Action”).  The  second  filed  action,  Iron  Workers  District  Council  (Philadelphia  and  Vicinity)  Retirement  and  Pension  Plan  v.  The  Kraft  Heinz
Company, was filed on March 15, 2019 against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former officers (the “Iron Workers Action”). The third
filed action, Timber Hill LLC v. The Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on April 25, 2019 against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former
officers and one of its directors (the “Timber Hill Action”). All of these securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois. Another securities class action lawsuit, Walling v. Kraft Heinz Company, was filed on February 26, 2019 in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against, among others, the Company and six of its current and former officers (the “Walling Action”).
Plaintiff in the Walling Action filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of his complaint, without prejudice, on April 26, 2019.

Plaintiffs in these lawsuits purport to represent a class of all individuals and entities who purchased, sold, or otherwise acquired or disposed of publicly traded
securities of the Company (including in the Timber Hill Action, the purchase of call options on Company common stock, the sale of put options on Company
common stock, and the purchase of futures on the Company’s common stock) from May 4, 2017 through February 21, 2019, in the case of the Hedick Action
and the Walling Action, and from July 6, 2015 through February 21, 2019, in the case of the Iron Workers Action and the Timber Hill Action. The complaints
assert  claims  under  Sections  10(b)  and  20(a)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  and  Rule  10b-5  promulgated
thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements, press releases, investor presentations, earnings
calls,  and  SEC  filings  regarding  the  Company’s  business,  financial  results,  and  internal  controls.  The  plaintiffs  seek  damages  in  an  unspecified  amount,
attorneys’ fees and other relief.

125

In  addition,  our  Employee  Benefits  Administration  Board  and  certain  of  our  current  and  former  employees  are  currently  defendants  in  one  class  action
lawsuit, Osborne v. Employee Benefits Administration Board of Kraft Heinz, which was filed on March 19, 2019 in the United States District Court for the
Western  District  of  Pennsylvania.  Plaintiffs  in  the  lawsuit  purport  to  represent  a  class  of  current  and  former  employees  who  were  participants  in  and
beneficiaries of various retirement plans which were co-invested in a commingled investment fund known as the Kraft Foods Savings Plan Master Trust (the
“Master Trust”) during the period of May 4, 2017 through February 21, 2019.  The complaint alleges violations of Section 502 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (“ERISA”) based on alleged breaches of obligations as fiduciaries subject to ERISA by allowing the Master Trust to continue investing
in our common stock. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount, attorneys’ fees, and other relief.

Certain of our current and former officers and directors, among others, are also currently defendants in five stockholder derivative actions: DeFabiis v. Hees
filed on April 16, 2019, Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Hees filed on May 8, 2019, Kailas v. Hees filed on May 13, 2019, Silverman v. Behring filed on
May  15,  2019,  and  Green  v.  Behring  filed  on  May  23,  2019,  with  the  Company  named  as  a  nominal  defendant.  Plaintiffs,  derivatively  on  behalf  of  the
Company, assert claims under the common law and statutory law of Delaware for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties as well as alleged violations of Sections
10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in
public statements and SEC filings. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecific amount, attorneys’ fees, and other relief. All of these stockholder derivative
actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, due to the early stage of
these proceedings.

Securities and Exchange Commission Investigation:
As  previously  disclosed  on  February  21,  2019,  we  received  a  subpoena  in  October  2018  from  the  SEC  related  to  our  procurement  area,  specifically  the
accounting  policies,  procedures,  and  internal  controls  related  to  our  procurement  function,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  agreements,  side  agreements,  and
changes  or  modifications  to  agreements  with  our  suppliers.  Following  the  receipt  of  this  subpoena,  we,  together  with  external  counsel  and  forensic
accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters.
Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21, 2019, when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible
asset impairments, the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting, internal controls, and disclosures, our assessment of goodwill
and intangible asset impairments, and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Northern  District  of  Illinois  also  is  reviewing  this  matter,  working  with  the  SEC  and  receiving  materials  from  it.  We  cannot  predict  the  eventual  scope,
duration  or  outcome  of  any  potential  SEC  legal  action  or  other  action  or  whether  it  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition,  results  of
operations,  or  cash  flow.  We  have  been  responsive  to  the  ongoing  subpoenas  and  other  document  requests  and  will  continue  to  cooperate  fully  with  any
governmental or regulatory inquiries or investigations.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

As  a  result  of  our  review  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements,  we  determined  that  the  classification  of  the  embedded  lease  element  for  certain
contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition, we identified certain arrangements that were improperly
accounted for as embedded capital leases. Therefore, future obligations associated with operating leases and purchase obligations have been restated below.
See Note 2, Restatement  of  Previously  Issued  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  for  additional  information  related  to  the  restatement  and  our  review  of
supplier contracts and related arrangements.

Leases:
Rental expenses for leases of warehouse, production, and office facilities and equipment were $200 million in 2018, $244 million in 2017, and $198 million
in 2016.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest:
In 2017, we commenced operations of a joint venture with a minority partner to manufacture, package, market, and distribute refrigerated soups and meal
sides. We control operations and include this business in our consolidated results. Our minority partner has put options that, if it chooses to exercise, would
require us to purchase portions of its equity interest at a future date. These put options will become exercisable beginning in 2025 (on the eighth anniversary
of the product launch date) at a price to be determined at that time based upon an independent third party valuation. The minority partner’s put options are
reflected  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  as  a  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest.  We  accrete  the  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  to  its  estimated
redemption value over the term of the put options. At December 29, 2018, we estimate the redemption value to be approximately $35 million.

Note 19. Debt

Borrowing Arrangements:
On  July  6,  2015,  together  with  Kraft  Heinz  Foods  Company  (“KHFC”),  our  100%  owned  operating  subsidiary,  we  entered  into  a  credit  agreement  (as
amended, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). In June 2018,
we entered into an agreement that became effective on July 6, 2018 to extend the maturity date of our Senior Credit Facility from July 6, 2021 to July 6, 2023
and to establish a $400 million euro equivalent swing line facility, which is available under the $4.0 billion revolving credit facility limit for short-term loans
denominated in euros on a same-day basis.

No  amounts  were  drawn  on  our  Senior  Credit  Facility  at  December  29,  2018,  at  December  30,  2017,  or  during  the  years  ended  December  29,  2018,
December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

The  Senior  Credit  Facility  includes  a  $1.0 billion  sub-limit  for  borrowings  in  alternative  currencies  (i.e.,  euro,  sterling,  Canadian  dollars,  or  other  lawful
currencies readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. dollars), as well as a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $300 million. Subject to
certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up
to $1.0 billion.

Any committed borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR/EURIBOR/CDOR loans or an alternate
base  rate/Canadian  prime  rate,  in  each  case  subject  to  an  applicable  margin  based  upon  the  long-term  senior  unsecured,  non-credit  enhanced  debt  rating
assigned  to  us.  The  borrowings  under  the  Senior  Credit  Facility  have  interest  rates  based  on,  at  our  election,  base  rate,  LIBOR,  EURIBOR,  CDOR,  or
Canadian prime rate plus a spread ranging from 87.5 to 175 basis points for LIBOR, EURIBOR, and CDOR loans, and 0 to 75 basis points for base rate or
Canadian prime rate loans.

The Senior Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could upon the occurrence of
certain events of default restrict our ability to access our Senior Credit Facility. Our Senior Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum shareholders’
equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)) of at least $35 billion. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the
year ended December 29, 2018.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants under the Senior Credit Facility.

127

However, as previously disclosed, on March 22, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the “Original Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit
Facility, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by
us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Pursuant
to the Original Waiver, we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14, 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial
reporting, on May 10, 2019, we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the “Second Waiver”) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility, pursuant to which
the lenders, as party to the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us
with respect to the requirements to furnish the lenders copies of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and for the
fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  Second  Waiver  and  in  order  to  remedy  our  noncompliance,  we  are  required  to  provide  consolidated
financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 no later than
July 31, 2019. If we had not obtained these waivers, we would not have been able to access our Senior Credit Facility.

The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by KHFC in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and by Kraft
Heinz in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and KHFC.

In August 2017, we repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”).
Accordingly, there were no amounts outstanding on the Term Loan Facility at December 29, 2018 or December 30, 2017.

We  obtain  funding  through  our  U.S.  and  European  commercial  paper  programs.  At  December  29,  2018,  we  had  no  commercial  paper  outstanding.  At
December 30, 2017, we had commercial paper outstanding of $448 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.541%.

Long-Term Debt:
The  following  table  summarizes  our  long-term  debt  obligations.  Long-term  debt  at  December  30,  2017  reflects  the  restatements  described  in  Note  2,

(a) Priority of debt indicates the order which debt would be paid if all debt obligations were due on the same day. Senior secured debt takes priority over unsecured debt. Senior debt has greater

seniority than subordinated debt.

(b) Floating interest rates are stated as of December 29, 2018.

(c) The 4.875% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due February 15, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) are senior in right of payment of existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness. Kraft

Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees these notes.

(d) Kraft Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees these notes, which were issued by KHFC.

(e) Includes current year issuances (the “New Notes”) described below.

(f) Kraft Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees these notes, which were issued by Kraft Heinz Canada ULC (formerly Kraft Canada Inc.).

(g) The 6.250%  Pound  Sterling  Senior  Secured  Notes  due  February  18,  2030  (the  “2030  Notes”)  were  issued  by  H.J.  Heinz  Finance  UK  Plc.  Kraft  Heinz  and  KHFC  fully  and  unconditionally
guarantee the 2030 Notes. This guarantee is secured and senior in right of payment of existing and future unsecured and subordinated indebtedness. Kraft Heinz became guarantor of the 2030
Notes in connection with the 2015 Merger. The 2030 Notes were previously only guaranteed by KHFC.

Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants during the year
ended December 29, 2018.

During  the  period  from  December  29,  2018  to  the  filing  date  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  due  to  the  delays  in  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  March  30,  2019,  we  were  not  in  compliance  with  certain  reporting
covenants under certain indentures. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 no later than June 28, 2019. We also currently expect to file our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 2019 on or before July 31, 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a
copy of the consolidated financial statements for such quarter no later than July 31, 2019.

Under our existing indentures, if we do not file required reports within specified time periods, the trustee or holders of at least 30% in the case of our Second
Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and 25% in the case of any other series of notes may deliver a notice of default for such series of notes which would
commence the applicable cure period under such indenture. As of June 5, 2019, none of the cure periods under our existing indentures have been triggered in
connection with our failure to comply with the respective reporting covenants set forth in such indentures. However, if a cure period is triggered under such
indentures and we fail to file our annual and interim financial statements within such cure period, any outstanding notes issued thereunder would become
callable.

At December 29, 2018, our long-term debt excluded amounts classified as held for sale. See Note 5, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information.

At December 29, 2018, aggregate principal maturities of our long-term debt excluding capital leases were (in millions):

Debt Issuances:
In June 2018, KHFC, our 100% owned operating subsidiary, issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2021, $1.6 billion
aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2023, and $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2029 (collectively, the
“New  Notes”).  The  New  Notes  are  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by  Kraft  Heinz  as  to  payment  of  principal,  premium,  and  interest  on  a  senior
unsecured basis.

We used approximately $500 million of the proceeds from the New Notes in connection with the wind-down of our U.S. securitization program in the second
quarter of 2018. We also used proceeds from the New Notes to refinance a portion of our commercial paper borrowings in the second quarter of 2018, to
repay certain notes that matured in July and August 2018, and for other general corporate purposes.

In August 2017, KHFC issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019, $650 million aggregate principal amount of
floating rate senior notes due 2021, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022 (collectively, the “2017 Notes”). The
2017 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Kraft Heinz as to payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior unsecured basis.

We used the net proceeds from the 2017 Notes primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our $600 million Term Loan Facility together with accrued
interest thereon, to refinance a portion of our commercial paper programs, and for other general corporate purposes.

In May 2016, KHFC issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior notes due June 2026, $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.375%
senior notes due June 2046, €550 million aggregate principal amount of 1.500% senior notes due May 2024, and €1,250 million aggregate principal amount
of  2.250%  senior  notes  due  May  2028  (collectively,  the  “2016  Notes”).  The  2016  Notes  are  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by  Kraft  Heinz  as  to
payment of principal, premium, and interest on a senior unsecured basis.

We used the net proceeds from the 2016 Notes primarily to redeem all outstanding shares of our 9.00% cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A
(“Series A Preferred Stock”) for $8.3 billion. See Note 20, Capital Stock, for additional information.

129

Debt Issuance Costs:
Debt issuance costs are reflected as a direct deduction of our long-term debt balance on the consolidated balance sheets. We incurred debt issuance costs of
$15  million  in  2018  and  $53  million  in  2016.  Debt  issuance  costs  in  2017  were  insignificant.  Unamortized  debt  issuance  costs  were  $115  million  at
December 29, 2018, $114 million at December 30, 2017, and $124 million at December 31, 2016. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $16 million  in
2018, $16 million in 2017, and $14 million in 2016.

Debt Premium:
Unamortized debt premiums are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct addition to the carrying amount of debt. Unamortized debt premium,
net, was $430 million at December 29, 2018 and $505 million at December 30, 2017. Amortization of our debt premium, net, was $65 million in 2018, $81
million in 2017, and $88 million in 2016.

Debt Repayments:
In  July  and  August  2018,  we  repaid  $2.7 billion  aggregate  principal  amount  of  senior  notes  that  matured  in  the  period.  We  funded  these  long-term  debt
repayments primarily with proceeds from the New Notes issued in June 2018.

Additionally, in June 2017, we repaid $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period. We funded these long-term debt
repayments primarily with cash on hand and our commercial paper programs.

Fair Value of Debt:
At December 29, 2018, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $30.1 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.2 billion. At December 30, 2017,
the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $33.0 billion as compared with a carrying value of $31.5 billion. Our short-term debt and commercial paper had
carrying values that approximated their fair values at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. We determined the fair value of our long-term debt using
Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.

Note 20. Capital Stock

Preferred Stock

Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 920,000 shares of preferred stock.

On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all 80,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for $8.3 billion. We funded this redemption primarily through
the issuance of long-term debt in May 2016, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our U.S. commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program,
and cash on hand. In connection with the redemption, all Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and automatically retired.

Common Stock

Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5.0 billion shares of common stock.

Basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 reflect the restatements that impacted net income/(loss) attributable to
common shareholders. The restatements had no impact on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding or dilutive equity awards in prior periods.
See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

We  use  the  treasury  stock  method  to  calculate  the  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  equity  awards  in  the  denominator  for  diluted  EPS.  We  had  net  losses
attributable to common shareholders in 2018. Therefore, we have excluded the dilutive effects of equity awards in 2018 as their inclusion would have had an
anti-dilutive effect on EPS. Anti-dilutive shares were 13 million in 2018, 2 million in 2017, and 3 million in 2016.

Note 22. Segment Reporting

Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and
depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts
of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general
corporate  expenses  until  realized;  once  realized,  the  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  the  applicable  segment’s  operating  results),  impairment  losses,
gains/(losses)  on  the  sale  of  a  business,  other  gains/(losses)  related  to  acquisitions  and  divestitures  (e.g.,  tax  and  hedging  impacts),  nonmonetary  currency
devaluation  (e.g.,  remeasurement  gains  and  losses),  and  equity  award  compensation  expense  (excluding  integration  and  restructuring  expenses).  Segment
Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain
items  that  management  believes  do  not  directly  reflect  our  underlying  operations.  Management  uses  Segment  Adjusted  EBITDA  to  evaluate  segment
performance and allocate resources.

Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment.

Restatement of Previously Issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

We have restated herein our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each interim period within the nine months ended
September  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  30,  2017.  See  Note  2,  Restatement  of  Previously  Issued  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  for
additional information.

The following tables represent our restated unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each quarter-to-date and year-to-date interim period
within  the  nine  months  ended  September  29,  2018  and  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  30,  2017  and  at  each  interim  period  therein.  The  2018  quarterly
restatements will be effective with the filing of our future 2019 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement filings in Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q.

The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 29, 2018, June 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018 were derived from our Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q filed on November 2, 2018, August 3, 2018, and May 3, 2018, respectively. The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarter
ended December 30, 2017 were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017 filed on February 16, 2018. The values
as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2017, July 1, 2017, and April 1, 2017 were derived from our Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q, as amended for the first and second quarters, all of which were filed on November 7, 2017. See Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated
Financial Statements, for a description of the misstatements in each category of restatements referenced by (a) through (g).

In addition, the condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within the year ended December 30, 2017, as previously reported, did
not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was
adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic
benefit cost components. Our condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within fiscal year 2017 have been recast accordingly. See
Note 4, New Accounting Standards, for additional information related to our adoption of ASU 2017-07.

Note 24. Supplemental Guarantor Information

Restatement of Previously Issued Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements

We have restated herein our previously issued condensed consolidating financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Following the restated condensed
consolidating financial statement tables, we have presented our condensed consolidating financial statements as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and
2016,  which  were  derived  from  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  30,  2017  filed  on  February  16,  2018.  See  Note  2,
Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information, including a description of the misstatements.

In addition, the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, as previously reported, did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to
the  presentation  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  (pension  and  postretirement  cost).  This  ASU  was  adopted  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018  and  was  applied
retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The condensed consolidating
statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been recast accordingly. See Note 4, New Accounting Standards, for additional information related
to our adoption of ASU 2017-07.

Supplemental Guarantor Information

Kraft Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees the notes issued by our 100% owned operating subsidiary, KHFC, including the New Notes. See Note 19,
Debt, for additional descriptions of these guarantees. None of our other subsidiaries guarantee these notes.

Set forth below are the condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Kraft Heinz (as
parent guarantor), KHFC (as subsidiary issuer of the notes), and the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis and eliminations necessary to arrive at
the total reported information on a consolidated basis. This condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  Regulation  S-X  Rule  3-10,  “Financial  Statements  of  Guarantors  and  Issuers  of  Guaranteed  Securities  Registered  or
being  Registered.”  This  information  is  not  intended  to  present  the  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows  of  the  individual  companies  or
groups of companies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Eliminations represent adjustments to eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances
and transactions between or among the parent guarantor, subsidiary issuer, and the non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act)  as  of  December  29,  2018.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  our  Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 29, 2018, due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal
control  over  financial  reporting  described  below,  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  not  effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management  as  appropriate  to  allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  defined  in  Rule  13a-15(f)  under  the
Exchange  Act.  Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

•

•

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  assets  that  could  have  a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  we  conducted  an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 based on the framework described in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 due to the material weaknesses
described below.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

We identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of
misstatement due to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiencies described
below, which we also determined to be material weaknesses:

•

Supplier  Contracts  and  Related  Arrangements:  We  did  not  design  and  maintain  effective  controls  over  the  accounting  for  supplier  contracts  and
related  arrangements.  Specifically,  certain  employees  in  our  procurement  organization  engaged  in  misconduct  and  circumvented  controls  that
included  withholding  information  or  directing  others  to  withhold  information  related  to  supplier  contracts  that  affected  the  accounting  for  certain
supplier rebates, incentives, and pricing arrangements, in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were
perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. Additionally, in certain instances, we did not
have a sufficient understanding or maintain sufficient documentation of the transaction to determine the appropriate accounting for certain cost and
rebate  elements  and  embedded  leases.  This  material  weakness  resulted  in  misstatements  that  were  corrected  in  the  restatement  included  in  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

215

•

Goodwill  and  Indefinite-lived  Intangible  Asset  Impairment  Testing:  We  did  not  design  and  maintain  effective  controls  to  reassess  the  level  of
precision  used  to  review  the  impairment  assessments  related  to  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  as  changes  in  our  business
environment  occurred.  Specifically,  we  did  not  design  and  maintain  effective  controls  to  reassess  the  level  of  precision  used  in  the  review  of  the
allocation  of  cash  flow  projections  to  certain  brands  used  as  a  basis  for  performing  our  fourth  quarter  2018  interim  impairment  assessments  in
response  to  the  significant  reduction  in,  and  in  certain  instances  elimination  of,  the  excess  fair  value  over  carrying  amount  of  certain  brands  that
resulted from changes in our business environment. This material weakness did not result in a misstatement of any previously issued consolidated
financial statements.

Additionally, the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned account balances or disclosures that would result
in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  that  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, as stated in their report
which appears herein under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Remediation of Material Weaknesses

We are evaluating the material weaknesses and developing a plan of remediation to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component
of internal control over financial reporting, supplier contracts and related arrangements, and the level of precision applied to the goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible  asset  impairment  testing  process.  The  remediation  efforts  summarized  below,  which  are  in  the  process  of  being  implemented,  are  intended  to
address the identified material weaknesses and enhance our overall internal control environment.

•

Personnel  Actions—A  comprehensive  disciplinary  plan  is  in  the  process  of  being  implemented  for  all  employees  found  to  have  engaged  in
misconduct, including termination, written warnings, and appropriate training depending on the severity of the misconduct.

Performance Targets—We have identified and will be implementing several performance-based target enhancements as follows: (i) implementing
checkpoints to evaluate significant changes in the environment that could adversely impact the attainability of management goals and targets; (ii)
reassessing and adjusting the overall balance of performance measures provided to employees to help drive challenging but attainable targets; and
(iii) enhancing our training and overall communication specific to the Management by Objective (“MBO”) process, including a focus on the process
to request relief from previously established MBOs, to help ensure all eligible employees are aware of and understand the overall MBO waiver and
relief  process;  (iv)  reinforcing  the  importance  of  adherence  to  established  internal  controls  and  company  policies  and  procedures  through  other
formal communications, town hall meetings, and other employee trainings; and (v) reassessing certain employees’ key performance indicators.

Organizational Enhancements—We have identified and are in the process of implementing organizational enhancements as follows: (i) augmenting
our  procurement  finance  teams  with  additional  professionals  with  the  appropriate  levels  of  accounting  and  controls  knowledge,  experience,  and
training  in  the  area  of  supplier  contracts  and  related  arrangements;  and  (ii)  realigning  reporting  lines  whereby  procurement  finance  now  report
directly to the finance organization.

Procurement  Practices—We  have  evaluated  our  procurement  practices  and  are  in  the  process  of  implementing  improvements  to  those  practices,
including: (i) developing more comprehensive contract approval policies and processes; (ii) enhancing required communication protocols among all
functions involved in the procurement process (e.g., procurement, legal, accounting, and finance) to ensure all relevant parties are involved in the
contract  review  process;  (iii)  standardizing  contract  documentation  and  analyses;  and  (iv)  developing  a  more  comprehensive  accounting  review
process and monitoring controls over supplier contracts and related arrangements to ensure transactions are recorded in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Training Practices—We are in the process of developing a comprehensive global procurement training program that will cover supplier contracts and
related arrangements, including potential accounting implications. As part of this effort, we have held mandatory training for our global procurement
function,  which  focused  on  our  policies  and  procedures  related  to  procurement,  including  the  proper  accounting  for  the  contract  terms  that
contributed to the material weakness.

Procurement Management Software—We have started to evaluate potential solutions to implement or upgrade the existing procurement management
software to enhance the identification, tracking, and monitoring of supplier contracts and related arrangements.

Level  of  Precision  Applied  to  Impairment  Testing—We  are  in  the  process  of  implementing  a  plan  to  enhance  the  level  of  precision  at  which  our
internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  relating  to  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  impairment  assessments  are  performed.
Specifically, we will be implementing and executing additional procedures to (i)

216

enhance our analysis of forecasted cash flows used in the impairment assessment and (ii) test the accuracy of forecasted cash flow allocations to
specific brands.

We  believe  the  measures  described  above  will  remediate  the  material  weaknesses  we  have  identified  and  strengthen  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and have begun to implement some of the steps described above. We will
also continue to review, optimize, and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal
control  over  financial  reporting,  we  may  take  additional  measures  to  address  control  deficiencies  or  we  may  modify  certain  of  the  remediation  measures
described above. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time
and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with other members of management, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December 29, 2018. We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the  three  months  ended  December  29,  2018  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS

Corporate Governance Guidelines

The  Guidelines  articulate  our  governance  philosophy,  practices,  and  policies  in  a  range  of  areas,  including:  the  Board’s  role  and  responsibilities;  the
composition  and  structure  of  the  Board;  the  establishment  and  responsibilities  of  the  committees  of  the  Board;  executive  and  director  performance
evaluations; and succession planning. The Governance Committee reviews the Guidelines annually and recommends any changes to the Board.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors and Code of Conduct for Employees

We have a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Non-Employee Directors (the “Directors Ethics Code”) that is designed to deter wrongdoing and
to promote:

•

•

•

•

•

honest and ethical conduct;

due care, diligence, and loyalty;

confidentiality of our proprietary information;

compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including insider trading compliance; and

accountability for adherence to the Directors Ethics Code and prompt internal reporting of violations.

220

Annually, each non-employee director acknowledges in writing that he or she has received, reviewed, and understands the Directors Ethics Code.

We also have a written Code of Conduct for employees (the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct includes a set of employee policies that cover ethical
and legal practices for nearly every aspect of our business. The Code of Conduct reflects our values and contains important rules our employees must follow
when conducting business to promote compliance and integrity. The Code of Conduct is part of our global compliance and integrity program that provides
support and training throughout our Company and encourages reporting of wrongdoing by offering anonymous reporting options and a non-retaliation policy.
We will disclose in the Corporate Governance section of our Web site (described below) any amendments to our Directors Ethics Code or Code of Conduct
and any waiver granted to an executive officer or director under these codes.

Corporate Governance Materials Available on Our Web Site

Our Web site contains the Guidelines, our Board committee charters, the Code of Conduct, and the Directors Ethics Code. To view these documents, go to
http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com and click on “Corporate Governance.” We will promptly deliver free of charge, upon request, a copy of the Guidelines, the
Board  committee  charters,  the  Code  of  Conduct,  or  the  Directors  Ethics  Code  to  any  stockholder  requesting  a  copy.  Requests  should  be  directed  to  our
Corporate Secretary at The Kraft Heinz Company, 200 East Randolph Street, Suite 7600, Chicago, IL 60601.

The information on our Web site is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our
other filings with the SEC.

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock (collectively, the
“Reporting Persons”), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments
thereto  filed  electronically  with  the  SEC  by  the  Reporting  Persons  with  respect  to  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  29,  2018,  we  believe  that  all  filing
requirements were complied with in a timely manner, except in two instances where Form 4s were inadvertently filed late on behalf of two directors to report
certain transactions as follows: (i) in April 2018, to report three purchases of shares that were executed by the broker of one of our former directors, Mackey
McDonald, on Mr. McDonald’s behalf without his knowledge or direction; and (ii) in June 2019, to report one transaction relating to the transfer of certain
shares held in a trust for the benefit of Mr. Pope’s three adult children as a result of their election to exercise control over such shares in accordance with the
terms of the trust that held these shares.

BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Board established the Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee consists
entirely of independent directors, and each director meets the independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of Nasdaq, Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act and the Audit Committee charter. The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member is able to read and understand fundamental
financial statements. In addition, the Board has determined that Ms. Jackson and Mr. Pope are “audit committee financial experts” within the meaning of SEC
regulations. No Audit Committee member received any payments in 2018 from us other than compensation for service as a director.

BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY COMMITTEE

Effective  June  5,  2019,  the  Board  established  the  Operations  and  Strategy  Committee  to  assist  it  in  overseeing  and  facilitating  the  development  and
implementation of our ongoing operations and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is led by John Cahill, Vice Chairman of the Board,
and  meets  with  management  regularly  to  discuss,  review  and  evaluate  the  development  and  implementation  of  our  operational  objectives  and  corporate
strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is comprised of five directors appointed by the Board, based on nominations recommended to the Board by
our  Nominating  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee.  Based  on  its  review,  the  committee  shares  with  management  the  Board’s  expectations  for  the
operations of the company and strategic planning process, makes recommendations to management on areas of improvement, and provides other feedback
and guidance to management on behalf of the Board. The Operations and Strategy Committee’s responsibilities also include, among others, reviewing and
making recommendations to the Board regarding:

•

•

•

our corporate strategy, performance, and annual capital plan, as well as certain individual capital projects;

the impact of external developments and factors, such as any changes in economic and market conditions, competition in the industry, environmental
and safety regulations, federal, state and local regulations and technology, on our corporate strategy and its execution;

identification of prospects and opportunities for corporate developments and growth initiatives, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures
and strategic alliances; and

221

•

implementation of our corporate strategy through corporate developments and growth initiatives, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures
and strategic alliances.

Item 11. Executive Compensation.

BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEMBERSHIP—COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

The Board has determined that all of the directors who served on the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 are independent within the meaning of
the  Nasdaq  listing  standards.  No  member  of  the  Compensation  Committee  is  a  current,  or  during  fiscal  year  2018  was,  a  former,  officer,  or  employee  of
Heinz, Kraft, Kraft Heinz, or any of their subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship that must be
described  under  the  SEC  rules  relating  to  disclosure  of  “related  person  transactions”  (for  a  description  of  our  policy  on  “related  person  transactions,”  see
“Independence and Related Person Transactions” in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence). During fiscal year
2018, none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers
serving on the Board or the Compensation Committee.

Analysis of Risk in the Compensation Architecture

Annually, the Compensation Committee evaluates the risk profile of our executive and broad-based employee compensation programs. In its evaluation for
fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed our executive compensation structure as well as our overarching compensation systems to determine
whether  our  compensation  policies  and  practices  encourage  our  executive  officers  or  other  employees  to  take  unnecessary  or  excessive  risks  and  whether
these  policies  and  practices  properly  mitigate  risk.  In  addition,  Willis  Towers  Watson  advised  management  with  respect  to  the  risk  assessment  of  our
Performance Bonus Plan.

As  described  under  “Compensation  Discussion  and  Analysis,”  our  compensation  structure  is  designed  to  incentivize  executives  and  employees  to  achieve
Kraft Heinz financial and strategic goals as well as individual performance goals that promote long-term stockholder returns. However, certain employees
within our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that included withholding information or directing others to withhold
information  related  to  supplier  contracts  that  affected  the  accounting  for  certain  supplier  rebates,  incentives,  and  pricing  arrangements,  in  an  attempt  to
influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our
business  environment.  We  are  undertaking  various  remedial  efforts  outlined  in  Item  9A,  Controls  and  Procedures,  and  expect  to  revise  the  Performance
Bonus Plan for 2019 to explicitly state applicable penalties such as score and/or percentage reductions and losses, up to and including ineligibility for and
forfeiture of payments under the Performance Bonus Plan for misconduct. We also expect to revise the Performance Bonus Plan for 2019 to require that if the
aforementioned  misconduct  is  discovered  after  the  payout  under  the  Performance  Bonus  Plan,  we  would  be  entitled  to  seek  equitable  relief  to  recoup  the
amounts paid, including without limitation disgorgement, in addition to any other remedies under the law.

Compensation Committee Report

The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation programs on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation
Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In reliance
on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

Following the 2015 Merger, the Board approved our non-employee director compensation program, which was designed to be similar to the program in place
at Kraft prior to the 2015 Merger. The table below summarizes the annual cash and equity compensation elements in place for our non-employee directors.

(1) If a director serves as Chair of multiple committees, he or she receives fees for only one committee. Therefore, Mr. Behring does not receive a retainer for service as Chair of the Governance

Committee.

(2) Effective June 5, 2019, the Board established the Operations and Strategy Committee to assist it in overseeing and facilitating the development and implementation of our ongoing operations

and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is led by John Cahill, Vice Chairman of the Board.

(3) Non-employee directors are awarded Kraft Heinz deferred shares. Although the deferred shares are vested as of the award date, the shares are not distributed until six months following the date
the non-employee director ceases to serve on our Board. When dividends are paid on our common stock, we accrue the value of the dividend paid and issue shares equal to the accrued value six
months after the director’s departure.

Non-employee directors receive an annual stock award that is granted effective immediately following our annual meeting of stockholders. We also pay the
non-employee directors cash retainers on a quarterly basis. Non-employee directors also have the option to (i) defer up to 100% of their cash retainers in 25%
increments into accounts that mirror certain funds in the Kraft Heinz 401(k) Plan pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors
or (ii) receive deferred shares annually in lieu of their cash retainer payable in arrears.

Our  stock  ownership  guidelines  require  non-employee  directors  who  elect  to  receive  compensation  for  service  as  directors  to  hold  shares  of  our  common
stock  in  an  amount  equal  to  five  times  the  annual  Board  retainer  (equivalent  to  $550,000)  within  five  years.  As  all  of  our  current  directors  have  served
following  the  2015  Merger  for  less  than  five  years,  they  are  not  yet  required  to  meet  the  stock  ownership  requirement.  We  feel  strongly  that  our  director
compensation program significantly aligns our non-employee directors’ and stockholders’ interests.

For as long as Mr. Zoghbi continues to serve as a Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, it is anticipated that he will not receive compensation for his services as a
director. For a discussion of Mr. Zoghbi’s compensation arrangement, please see “Compensation Arrangement” in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which we refer to as the “CD&A”, outlines the compensation philosophy and objectives of Kraft Heinz and
describes our executive pay programs for fiscal year 2018 and, specifically, for the following Named Executive Officers (also referred to as “NEOs”):

Name
Bernardo Hees

David Knopf

Paulo Basilio

  Title
  Chief Executive Officer

  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

  Zone President of U.S.

Rafael Oliveira

  Zone President of EMEA

Rashida La Lande

  Senior Vice President, Global General Counsel and Head of CSR and Government Affairs; Corporate Secretary

Executive Summary

The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) oversees our executive compensation plans and programs. Our programs are designed to complement each
other to provide a clear link between what we pay our NEOs and Kraft Heinz’s performance over both short- and long-term periods. The overall program has
been designed to accomplish each of the following goals:

•

•

•

•

Rewarding superior financial and operational performance;

Placing a significant portion of compensation at risk if performance goals are not achieved;

Aligning the interests of the NEOs with those of our stockholders; and

Enabling us to attract, retain, and motivate top talent.

Consistent with these goals and as described in further detail below, our compensation program has been designed with a view toward linking a significant
portion of each NEO’s compensation to Company and individual performance and the growth in the value of Kraft Heinz.

224

Elements of Compensation Program

As noted above, our compensation program is based on a pay-for-performance philosophy. This section of the CD&A provides an overview of each element
of our compensation program and describes both the process for determining such compensation and how such compensation relates to Kraft Heinz’s pay-for-
performance philosophy and meritocratic principles. The following table summarizes the primary elements and objectives of our 2018 compensation program
for executive officers, including our NEOs.

Element

Base Salary

Ongoing cash compensation based on the executive officer’s role and
responsibilities, individual job performance, and experience.

Description

Annual Cash Incentive
(Performance Bonus
Plan)

Annual incentive with target award amounts for each executive officer. Actual
cash payouts are linked to achievement of annual Company goals and individual
performance. For fiscal year 2018, payouts could range from 0%-130% of target
depending on the relevant metric.

achievement of the performance objectives and subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions.

• Drive top-tier performance
• Align with stockholders’ interests
• Long-term value creation
• Retention

Base salary is the principal “fixed” element of executive compensation at Kraft Heinz and for our NEOs. The Committee believes that it is important that
each NEO receive a competitive marketplace base salary to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation. The initial base salary
of each NEO is established in connection with the hiring of such NEO. In establishing base salaries, Kraft Heinz reviews market-based survey data published
by the Hay Group and select country-specific surveys, in each case, for informational purposes only. We do not formally benchmark compensation or target
compensation  levels  at  any  particular  percentile  of  the  survey  data.  The  Committee  reviews  salaries  on  an  annual  basis  and  generally  makes  any  annual
changes  effective  January  1st.  On  occasion,  Kraft  Heinz  may  review  and  adjust  an  executive’s  base  salary  during  the  course  of  the  year  to  account  for
increased responsibilities, roles, and other factors. The Committee has sole responsibility for the review of Mr. Hees’s compensation. Mr. Hees has primary
responsibility for the review of the compensation of his direct reports, including the other NEOs, and provides salary recommendations to the Committee.

The table below shows the annualized 2018 base salary for each NEO.

(1) Mr. Oliveira’s base salary is paid in British pounds. The amount shown in the table above is based on the following 12-month average exchange rate of 0.7499 USD/GBP. Mr. Oliveira’s base

salary was increased effective January 1, 2018 in connection with the Committee’s annual base salary review process.

(2) Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22, 2018.

We  believe  that  the  base  salary  review  process  serves  our  pay-for-performance  philosophy,  because  base  pay  increases  are  generally  merit-based  and
dependent on the NEO’s success and achievement in his or her role. In addition, each NEO’s target annual incentive award opportunity, as described below, is
based on a percentage of his or her base salary. Therefore, as NEOs earn merit-based salary increases, their annual incentive award opportunities also increase
proportionately.

225

Annual Cash Performance Bonus Plan

The Performance Bonus Plan (the “PBP”) is designed to motivate and reward employees who contribute positively toward our business strategy and achieve
their  individual  performance  objectives.  For  2018,  the  formula  for  determining  a  PBP  participant’s  annual  bonus  payout  was  as  follows  (each  item  being
described in more detail below):

Base Salary x Target Award x Financial Multiplier x Individual Rating = PBP Payout

Due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to
the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018, and the Committee approved their forfeitures.

Base Salary

For a description of our NEOs’ base salaries, please see “Base Salary” above. Because Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22, 2018, the base salary used for
her PBP calculation was prorated to reflect her service for 11 months.

Target Award

Each NEO is granted a target award opportunity prior to the beginning of each year, which is set as a percentage of the NEO’s annual base salary: 300% for
Mr.  Hees,  175%  for  Mr.  Knopf,  250%  for  Mr.  Basilio,  175%  for  Mr.  Oliveira,  and  150%  for  Ms.  La  Lande.  Due  to  the  nature  of  Mr.  Hees’s  role  and
responsibilities and the significant nature of Mr. Basilio’s role as President of our largest business, their respective Target Award Opportunities were greater
than the other NEOs, although, as noted above, due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees,
Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018, and the Committee approved their
forfeitures.

Financial Multiplier

Another  component  of  a  participant’s  PBP  calculation  is  the  Company’s  (or  the  relevant  Zone’s  or  business  unit’s)  financial  performance  (“Financial
Multiplier”).  For  2018,  the  Financial  Multiplier  was  initially  designed  to  be  based  on  Adjusted  EBITDA  performance  and  could  have  ranged  from  0%  to
150%,  with  performance  between  threshold  and  maximum  levels  resulting  in  a  payout  between  50%  and  150%,  and  with  performance  below  threshold
resulting in no payout. In June 2018, our management team established a revised business plan for the second half of the 2018 fiscal year (the “2H Plan”).
The 2H Plan was intended to drive net sales (“NSV”) growth by regaining distribution and building velocity to position the Company for long-term financial
health  and  success.  In  June  2018,  in  order  to  (i)  capture  overall  commercial,  operational,  and  financial  performance  of  the  Company  and  (ii)  incentivize
management to deliver the 2H Plan to position the Company for long-term financial health and success, the Committee exercised its discretion under the PBP
to include NSV and Adjusted Net Income as elements of the Financial Multiplier as described below. A participant’s final Financial Multiplier was calculated
based on the metrics aligned to the 2H Plan. As described above, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio forfeited their respective rights to the amounts payable
pursuant to the PBP for 2018. For Mr. Oliveira and Ms. La Lande, the amounts payable calculated pursuant to the metrics aligned to the 2H Plan were greater
than if they had been calculated using the metrics as initially designed.

For  2018,  for  participants  evaluated  based  on  global  performance,  including  Messrs.  Hees  and  Knopf  and  Ms.  La  Lande,  the  Financial  Multiplier  was
calculated based on global change in Adjusted Net Income. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Adjusted Net Income, the
component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 100%. If the threshold had not been met, the component multiplier would be 0%.

For  participants  evaluated  based  on  Zone  (operating  segment)  or  business  unit  performance,  including  Messrs.  Basilio  and  Oliveira,  who  were  evaluated
based on U.S. and EMEA Zone performance, respectively, the Financial Multiplier was calculated based 30% on global change in Adjusted Net Income and
70% based on their respective Zone or business unit financial performances. Zone and business unit financial performance was based 75% on change in NSV
and 25% on change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA. If performance resulted between the threshold and target levels for NSV, the component multiplier would
have ranged from 60% to 100%, depending on the Zone. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Segment Adjusted EBITDA,
the component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 130%. For all cases, if the threshold had not been met, the relevant component multiplier would be
0%.

*Growth rates reflect budget foreign exchange rates and exclude the impacts of (i) our Venezuelan subsidiary, due to the highly inflationary environment, (ii) our 50.1% interest in our South African
subsidiary, which was sold in May 2018, and (iii) with respect to NSV, fluctuations for dairy commodities that impact pricing terms under related contracts. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net
income/(loss) excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the
sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax
Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit), and including, when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined
as  net  income/(loss)  from  continuing  operations  before  interest  expense,  other  expense/(income),  net,  provision  for/(benefit  from)  income  taxes,  and  depreciation  and  amortization  (excluding
integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on
commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating
results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation
(e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses).

(1) When the Committee certified the achievement of performance with respect to Adjusted Net Income performance, fiscal year 2018 consolidated financial statements were still being prepared.
Given  the  immateriality  of  any  anticipated  adjustments,  the  Committee  certified  and  approved  performance  at  a  maximum  level  of  64%,  subject  to  downward  adjustment  in  management’s
discretion based on the preparation of the 2018 consolidated financial statements.

(2) When the Committee certified performance with respect to EMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA performance, the Committee certified and approved performance at an amount excluding the

impact of the Middle East and Africa (“MEA”) due to one-off inventory amounts related to previous years when MEA was a part of a different operating segment than EMEA.

In 2018, all NEOs exceeded threshold on their Individual Rating and Financial Multiplier components of the PBP calculation. The Committee granted certain
members of management discretion to increase or decrease the final PBP payouts of the other NEOs with up to a 20% variance compared to the amounts as
calculated based on the Base Salaries, Target Awards, Individual Ratings, and Financial Multipliers described above. Had they not forfeited their rights to the
payment, Mr. Hees would have earned a PBP payout of $1,060,000, Mr. Knopf would have earned a PBP payout of $500,000, and Mr. Basilio would have
earned a PBP payout of $1,023,000. Mr. Oliveira received a PBP payout of $733,854, and Ms. La Lande received a PBP payout of $543,000. Mr. Hees would
have received a decreased discretionary payout related to the longer-term business initiatives reflected in his MBOs. Messrs. Knopf and Basilio would have
received,  and  Mr.  Oliveira  and  Ms.  La  Lande  did  receive,  an  increased  discretionary  payout  related  to  top  line  growth  results  and/or  strong  leadership  of
important initiatives in his or her respective area.

Individual Rating

The foundation of each participant’s Individual Rating is our MBO process. At the beginning of each year, the Committee establishes a series of performance
goals,  or  MBOs,  that  are  established  based  on  the  Company’s  corporate  strategy,  and  performance  goals  are  then  “cascaded”  throughout  the  organization.
First, the Committee establishes MBOs for Mr. Hees. Then, in consultation with the Committee, Mr. Hees establishes corresponding MBOs for each of his
direct reports, including the other NEOs. His direct reports, in turn, establish MBOs for their direct reports. This cascading process allows the Company to
drive initiatives that are aligned throughout the organization.

Each NEO has an MBO comprised of multiple goals or objectives. For each goal, there are one or more “Key Performance Indicators,” or KPIs. KPIs are the
quantitative or qualitative metrics used to track achievement of the goals. We have set forth below a summary of the 2018 MBO goals for each of the NEOs
and  the  overall  performance  ascribed  by  the  Committee  for  each  NEO  based  on  his  or  her  performance.  None  of  the  individual  KPIs  are  material  to
understanding how the PBP operated in 2018.

Bernardo  Hees:  Mr.  Hees  had  three  MBO  goals.  These  were:  (i)  “Deliver  Kraft  Heinz  Financial  Results”,  which  was  evaluated  based  on  Kraft  Heinz’s
financial  performance  in  NSV  and  Adjusted  Net  Income,  (ii)  “Strengthen  Innovation  and  Develop  Digital  Strategy/Go-to-Market”,  which  was  evaluated
based on the innovation pipeline for 2019 and 2020 and E-commerce and digital innovation, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business”, which
was evaluated based on the supply chain planning system and business expansion. Based on Mr. Hees’s performance, he was given an overall performance
score of 66%.

David  Knopf:  Mr.  Knopf  had  three  MBO  goals.  These  were  (i)  “Deliver  Kraft  Heinz  Financial  Results”,  which  was  evaluated  based  on  Kraft  Heinz’s
financial  performance  in  Adjusted  Net  Income  and  operating  free  cash  flow,  (ii)  “Increase  KHC  Financial  Efficiency”,  which  was  evaluated  based  on  tax
performance compared to budget and project-specific goals, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business”, which was evaluated based on business
expansion and project-specific goals. Based on Mr. Knopf's performance, he was given an overall performance score of 82%.

227

Paulo  Basilio:  Mr.  Basilio  had  three  MBO  goals.  These  were  (i)  “Deliver  Kraft  Heinz  Results”,  which  was  evaluated  based  on  case  fill  rates  and  U.S.
financial performance in contribution margin and NSV, (ii) “Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&D Pipeline,” which was evaluated based on market
share and the innovation pipeline for 2019 in the U.S. Zone, and (iii) “Deliver New Projects to Foster the Business”, which was evaluated based on initiatives
relating to Kraft Heinz’s Springboard platform. Based on Mr. Basilio’s performance, he was given an overall performance score of 84%.

Rafael Oliveira: Mr. Oliveira had three MBO goals. These were (i) “Deliver Kraft Heinz EMEA Financial Results,” which was evaluated based on EMEA
financial performance in contribution margin and NSV, (ii) “Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&D Pipeline,” which was evaluated based on market
share  and  the  innovation  pipeline  for  2019  in  the  EMEA  Zone,  and  (iii)  “Deliver  New  Projects  to  Foster  the  Business,”  which  was  evaluated  based  on
foodservice growth in EMEA and NSV growth in MEA. Based on Mr. Oliveira’s performance, he was given an overall performance score of 84%.

Rashida  La  Lande:  Ms.  La  Lande  had  three  MBO  goals.  These  were  (i)  “Deliver  Effective  and  Efficient  Legal  Services,”  which  was  evaluated  based  on
project-specific goals and legal victories, financial and EBITDA partnerships with the business, and legal victories from ongoing litigation, (ii) “Protect and
Promote our Innovations and Brands,” which was evaluated based on Board projects and crisis management design and preparation for the U.S. and Canada,
and  (iii)  “Ethics  and  Compliance”  which  was  evaluated  based  on  the  Company’s  ethics  and  compliance  initiatives  worldwide.  Based  on  Ms.  La  Lande’s
performance, she was given an overall performance score of 95%.

Annual Bonus Swap Program - Restricted Stock Units

As part of its commitment to fostering an ownership mentality, Kraft Heinz permits certain employees to participate in an annual bonus swap program (the
“Bonus Swap Program”). Under the Bonus Swap Program, eligible employees can elect to invest a portion of their annual PBP payout in our common stock
(we refer to these purchased shares as “Investment Shares”) and leverage that investment through the issuance of matching RSUs (we refer to these RSUs as
“Matching  RSUs”).  The  Matching  RSUs  cliff  vest  on  the  fifth  anniversary  of  the  date  of  grant  subject  to  continued  employment  and  the  retention  of  the
Investment Shares as described below. To participate in the Bonus Swap Program, eligible employees can elect to use 0%, 25% or 50% of their calculated net
bonus  (after  deducting  an  amount  based  on  a  normalized  tax  rate  depending  on  country  of  residence)  to  purchase  Investment  Shares.  The  number  of
Investment Shares purchased is calculated as the product of the calculated net bonus and the swap election percentage, divided by the closing price reported
on the Nasdaq on the date of purchase:

Calculated Net Bonus

x

Swap Election %

Nasdaq Closing Price

= # of Investment Shares

The number of Matching RSUs a participant received in 2018 was based on (1) the participant’s gross bonus payout in 2018 relating to the 2017 fiscal year
(before-tax) and (2) a discretionary multiplier associated with the participant’s level in the organization and his or her investment election percentage.

In 2018, only Mr. Oliveira participated in the Bonus Swap Program, as he was the only NEO to receive a PBP bonus payment related to 2017. The following
table  sets  forth,  for  Mr.  Oliveira,  the  portion  of  his  fiscal  2017  bonus  used  to  purchase  Investment  Shares  (the  “Conversion  Amount”),  the  number  of
Investment Shares purchased, and the number of Matching RSUs granted to him (which Matching RSUs were granted in 2018):

Conversion Amount
($)

Investment Shares
(#)

121,807

1,821

2017 Bonus Matching
RSUs granted in 2018
(#)

6,622

Under our Bonus Swap Program, so long as the Matching RSUs remain unvested, if an employee transfers any of the related Investment Shares, he or she
immediately forfeits a proportional amount of the corresponding Matching RSUs. The Committee believes that the Bonus Swap Program as a whole and the
forfeitability  of  the  Matching  RSUs  in  particular,  strongly  motivates  eligible  employees  to  hold  Kraft  Heinz  common  stock  for  the  long-term,  further
emphasizing a long-term view in creating stockholder value. Prior to 2016, the Company issued matching stock options rather than Matching RSUs in the
Bonus Swap Program.

228

Discretionary Equity Awards

From time to time, we may make discretionary equity awards to employees. Historically, these discretionary awards have been made in the form of stock
options. These stock options are granted with an exercise price based on the fair market value of a Kraft Heinz share on the grant date and cliff vest after a
five-year period. In 2018, the Committee approved discretionary option awards of 44,850 stock options to Mr. Knopf and 52,325 stock options to Ms. La
Lande in order to continue to align a portion of their long-term incentive compensation directly with stockholders’ interests. The options have an exercise
price of $66.89 and will cliff vest on March 1, 2023, subject to continued employment through that date.

In March 2018, the Company issued additional PSUs to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals, including all of
our NEOs, in order to place a significant portion of their compensation at risk if performance goals are not achieved. These PSUs could be earned over a
three-year performance period based on Kraft Heinz’s achievement of financial performance metrics based on Adjusted EBITDA for the period beginning in
January 2018 and ending at the end of December 2020. Once earned, to promote retention of key talent, the PSUs will remain subject to a continued service
requirement through March 1, 2023. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to
be zero.

In  March  2018,  in  order  to  further  retain  and  motivate  top  talent  and  align  the  interests  of  management  with  those  of  the  Company’s  stockholders,  the
Company also issued RSUs, separately from the Bonus Swap Program, to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals,
including all of our NEOs. These RSUs will cliff vest on March 1, 2023, subject to continued employment.

Additional information about the stock option, PSU, and RSU awards is provided in the 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table and the 2018 Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table below.

Benefits and Perquisites

In addition to base salary, our PBP, and long-term equity grants, we provided and continue to provide certain executive benefit programs to our NEOs. Kraft
Heinz maintains defined contribution retirement plans to allow employees to save for retirement in a tax-efficient manner. These plans are broadly available
to eligible employees and do not discriminate in favor of the NEOs or other members of senior management. None of the NEOs participate in any defined
benefit pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, or supplemental retirement or executive savings plans.

Kraft Heinz also provides health and welfare insurance benefits to employees, including the NEOs. These benefits include life, disability, and health insurance
benefit plans that are broadly available to eligible employees and do not discriminate in favor of the NEOs or other members of senior management.

From  time  to  time,  Kraft  Heinz  provides  limited  perquisite  benefits.  For  example,  we  provide  limited  tax  advisory  services,  immigration  benefits,  and
reimbursement  of  certain  relocation  expenses  for  business  reasons.  Kraft  Heinz  provides  other  limited  perquisite  benefits,  which  are  detailed  in  the  2018
Summary Compensation Table.

Minimum Stock Ownership Guidelines

Our compensation programs promote a strong alignment of the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. For example, in order to participate
in our Bonus Swap Program, each participant must use a significant portion of his or her bonus to purchase our common stock. In 2016, we adopted minimum
stock ownership guidelines, which require our NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership measured based on a multiple of his or her annual base
salary, as set forth below:

Role
CEO

Other Named Executive Officers

Minimum Ownership
5x Base Salary

3x Base Salary

The stock ownership guidelines require NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership within five years from the later of December 8, 2016 and the date
of the NEO’s appointment to a position subject to the guidelines. For more details on the stock ownership of our NEOs, please refer to “Ownership of Equity
Securities.”

229

Clawback, Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies

Our stock option, PSU, and RSU award agreements provide that, in certain circumstances, the award and any proceeds or other benefits a participant may
receive may be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to Kraft Heinz to the extent required to comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws
and/or the rules. Further, if a participant receives any amount in excess of what he or she should have received under the terms of the award for any reason
(including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations, or administrative error), all as determined by the Committee, then
he or she will be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to Kraft Heinz. Our insider trading policy also limits the timing and types of transactions
in Kraft Heinz securities by executive officers, including our NEOs. Among other restrictions, the policy prohibits holding Kraft Heinz securities in a margin
account or pledging Kraft Heinz securities as collateral for a loan without advance written notice to the Corporate Secretary. In addition, the policy prohibits
short-selling Kraft Heinz securities, transacting in puts, calls, or other derivatives on Kraft Heinz securities, or hedging transactions on Kraft Heinz securities
without prior approval from the Corporate Secretary.

Impact of Tax and Accounting Policies

When determining total direct compensation packages, the Committee considers all factors that may have an impact on our financial performance, including
tax and accounting rules and regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits our ability to deduct compensation
paid to “covered employees” (as defined in the Code) to the extent such compensation exceeds $1 million to such employee in any fiscal year. For taxable
years  beginning  prior  to  January  1,  2018,  there  was  a  performance-based  exception  to  this  rule  that  permitted  us  to  deduct  compensation  that  met  certain
qualifying performance-based criteria. This performance-based exception no longer applies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that
compensation  paid  to  our  “covered  employees”  in  excess  of  $1  million  will  not  be  deductible  unless  it  qualifies  for  limited  transition  relief  applicable  to
certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.

Despite  the  Committee’s  intentions  to  structure  the  Company’s  incentive  programs  for  taxable  years  commencing  prior  to  January  1,  2018  in  a  manner
intended  to  be  exempt  from  the  deduction  limitations  of  Section  162(m),  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  limited
transition relief and satisfy the requirements for such exemption. Further, the Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended
to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs.

(1) On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. Mr. Hees forfeited the PSU and RSU awards granted in 2018 (aggregate grant date fair value of $25,483,713)
due  to  the  performance  of  the  business  and  his  decision  to  leave  the  company,  respectively.  Therefore,  the  Total  Compensation  as  Adjusted  from  SEC  Rules  paid  to  Mr.  Hees  in  2018  was
$1,149,136.

(2) The amounts shown in this column include the aggregate grant date fair value, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of (i) Matching RSUs, (ii) PSUs, and (iii) RSUs granted to
the NEOs. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the
valuation of the awards in this column, see Note 12, Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Under our Bonus Swap Program, the Matching
RSUs for the NEOs were calculated as the product of the calculated gross bonus and the swap election percentage, divided by the closing price reported on the Nasdaq on the date of purchase.
For a discussion of the terms applicable to the Matching RSUs, PSUs, and RSUs as well as vesting, forfeiture, and other terms, see “Elements of Compensation Program” in the CD&A.

(3) As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. For Mr. Hees, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $17,838,582. For Mr. Knopf, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on March 1, 2018 was $4,162,349. For Mr. Basilio, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $11,892,369. For Mr. Oliveira, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on March 1, 2018 was $5,946,213. For Ms. La Lande, the grant date fair value of the PSU award on
March 1, 2018 was $1,486,582. The grant date fair value for the PSU award granted on March 1, 2018 was $56.82.

For Mr. Hees, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $7,645,131. On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his
departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018. For Mr. Knopf, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $1,783,864. For Mr. Basilio, the grant date value of
the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $5,096,754. For Mr. Oliveira, the grant date value of the RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $2,548,377. For Ms. La Lande, the grant date value of the
RSU award on March 1, 2018 was $1,486,582. The grant date fair value for the RSU awards was $66.89 for award granted on March 1, 2018 under the bonus swap program and was $56.82 for
non-dividend eligible award granted on March 1, 2018.

(4) Amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of discretionary option awards granted to the NEOs. The values of the stock option awards are equal to their grant
date  fair  value  as  computed  in  accordance  with  FASB  ASC  Topic  718.  For  a  discussion  of  the  assumptions  made  in  the  valuation  of  the  stock  option  awards  in  this  column,  see  Note  12,
Employees’ Stock Incentive Plans, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

231

(5) Amounts reported in this column reflect compensation earned for 2018 performance under our PBP. As discussed in the CD&A and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, due to
the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP
with respect to fiscal year 2018 and the Committee approved their forfeitures. The bonuses were paid in cash to each other NEO after the end of 2018.

(6) For Mr. Hees, represents dividend equivalents that accrued on Matching RSUs ($128,176), a matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage. For Mr. Knopf,
represents  a  matching  contribution  to  the  Kraft  Heinz  401(k),  dividend  equivalents  that  accrued  on  Matching  RSUs,  and  basic  life  insurance  coverage.  For  Mr.  Basilio,  represents  dividend
equivalents that accrued on Matching RSUs ($63,609), a matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage. For Mr. Oliveira, represents dividend equivalents
that accrued on Matching RSUs ($42,298), tax support, and a matching contribution to the UK contribution scheme. For Ms. La Lande, represents payment for relocation expenses ($66,664), a
matching contribution to the Kraft Heinz 401(k), and basic life insurance coverage.

(7) To supplement the SEC-required disclosure in the other columns of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, we have included this additional column, which shows “Total Compensation as
Adjusted from SEC Rules” representing the portion of the “Total Compensation” available to each NEO in each of the years shown. We are presenting this supplemental column to show how
the Committee views the NEOs’ compensation for each of the years shown. The “Total Compensation” column as calculated under SEC rules includes several items that are not necessarily
reflective of compensation available to the NEOs in a particular year. Amounts reported in the “Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” column differ substantially from the amounts
determined  under  SEC  rules  as  reported  in  the  “Total  Compensation”  column.  “Total  Compensation  as  Adjusted  from  SEC  Rules”  is  not  a  substitute  for  “Total  Compensation.”  “Total
Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” represents: (1) “Total Compensation,” as calculated under applicable SEC rules, minus (2) the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards (as
reflected in the “Stock Awards” and “Option Awards” columns), and plus (3) the value realized from any exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs or PSUs before payment of any
applicable withholding taxes and brokerage commissions (as reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested tables of the proxy statements for the respective years), including the value
realized from the payment of any dividend equivalents. In addition, “Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules” reflects any bonus paid in each of the years shown, whereas the “Total
Compensation” column calculated pursuant to the SEC rules reflects any bonus earned for the applicable years (regardless of when paid and not taking into account any subsequent forfeitures
thereof).

(8) Foreign  currency  conversion  based  on  daily  average  for  calendar  year  2018.  Mr.  Oliveira’s  base  salary  is  paid  in  British  pounds.  The  amounts  shown  in  the  table  above  are  based  on  the

following 12-month average exchange rate: British pounds (.7499 USD/GBP).

232

Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table

The following table sets forth information regarding the grant of plan-based awards for each of the NEOs in 2018. As described in the CD&A, due to the
difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio have forfeited their rights to the amounts
payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018.

(1) For  Messrs.  Hees  and  Knopf  and  Ms.  La  Lande,  the  PBP  is  based  on  global  change  in  Adjusted  Net  Income  and  has  a  Threshold  assumption  of  60%  and  Maximum  assumption  of  100%.
Threshold amounts also assume a minimum individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. The actual payment would be
based on achievement of individual and financial performance goals. Annual incentive award payments, to the extent not forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based
on actual results achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.

(2) On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018.

(3) For  Mr.  Basilio,  the  US  Zone  PBP  is  based  75%  on  change  in  U.S.  NSV  and  25%  on  change  in  U.S.  Segment  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  has  a  Threshold  assumption  of  60%,  and  Maximum
assumption of 90% for NSV change and 130% for Segment Adjusted EBITDA change. Threshold amounts also assume an individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts
assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. Mr. Basilio’s actual payment is based on achievement of individual goals and would receive a weighting on financial performance split by 70% of the
US Zone metrics plus 30% of the global metrics. Annual incentive award payments, to the extent not forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based on actual results
achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.

(4) For Mr. Oliveira, the EMEA Zone PBP is based 75% on change in EMEA NSV and 25% on change in EMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA and has a Threshold assumption of 70% for NSV
change  and  60%  for  Segment  Adjusted  EBITDA  change,  and  Maximum  assumption  of  100%  for  NSV  change  and  130%  for  Segment  Adjusted  EBITDA  change.  Threshold  amounts  also
assume an individual MBO Score of 50%, while Target and Maximum amounts assume an individual MBO Score of 100%. Mr. Oliveira’s actual payment is based on achievement of individual
goals  and  will  receive  a  weighting  on  financial  performance  split  by  70%  of  the  EMEA  Zone  metrics  plus  30%  of  the  global  metrics.  Annual  incentive  award  payments,  to  the  extent  not
forfeited, were made in cash to each NEO after the end of 2018 based on actual results achieved. Actual amounts earned are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table under Non-Equity
Incentive Plan Compensation.

233

(5) The PSUs granted on March 1, 2018 were granted under the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The target number of shares shown in the table reflects the number of shares of common stock that
will be earned if each of the performance metrics are achieved at target levels by the end of 2020. If 80% of the performance metrics are not achieved by the end of 2020, the target and threshold
opportunities roll over to 2021 with a 20 percentage point payout penalty. Actual shares awarded will vest on March 1, 2023 provided the awardee also meets certain requirements. Dividends are
not earned on the PSUs. As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero.

3/1/18

Matching RSUs granted on March 1, 2016, March 1, 2017, and March 1, 2018 are scheduled to vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.

(2) The market value of the shares that have not vested is based on the closing price of $43.57 for Kraft Heinz common stock on December 28, 2018, the last trading day of our fiscal year, as

reported on Nasdaq.

100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on August 20, 2020.

100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on February 12, 2020. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.

100% of these awards vested on February 14, 2019, and they are scheduled to expire on February 14, 2024. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015
Merger.

100% of these awards vested on July 1, 2018, and they are scheduled to expire on July 1, 2023. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.

(8) As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. The shares reported in this row represent potentially issuable
shares under the PSU award granted on March 1, 2017, which cliff vest on March 1, 2022. The PSUs represent the right to receive a variable number of Kraft Heinz shares based on Kraft
Heinz’s actual performance during a define performance period. If 80% of the performance target is achieved in 2019, the participant will receive 70% of the underlying shares. If 80% of the
performance target is achieved in 2020, participant will receive 65% of the underlying shares and if 80% of the performance target is achieved in 2021, the participant will receive 60% of the
underlying shares. The number of shares reported in this row is based on threshold performance. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on the PSUs. If the participant is terminated prior to March
1, 2020, he or she will forfeit the entire award. The PSUs will vest as earned on March 1, 2022.

100% of the award is scheduled to vest on March 1, 2021.

(10) 100% of the award is scheduled to vest on May 21, 2019. Options and exercise price reflect the conversion in connection with the 2015 Merger.

(11) 100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on March 1, 2023.

(12) 100% of these awards are scheduled to vest on March 1, 2023, and the RSU awards are not dividend eligible.

(13) As of December 29, 2018, due to the performance of our business, the expected payout of the PSUs was determined to be zero. The shares reported in these rows represent potentially issuable
shares under the PSU award granted on March 1, 2018, which cliff vest on March 1, 2023. The PSUs represent the right, to the extent not forfeited, to receive a variable number of Kraft Heinz
shares based on Kraft Heinz’s actual performance during a defined performance period. If the threshold of the performance target is achieved by the end of 2020, the participant will receive
80% of the underlying shares. If the threshold for the performance target is not achieved by the end of 2020, the target and threshold opportunities roll over to 2021 with a 20 percentage point
payout penalty. The number of shares reported in these rows is based on threshold performance. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on the PSUs. If the participant is terminated prior to March
1, 2021, he or she will forfeit the entire award. The PSUs will vest as earned on March 1, 2023 provided the awardee also meets certain requirements.

(14) On April 22, 2019, we announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019. As a result of his departure, Mr. Hees will forfeit the RSU award granted in 2018.

(1) No enhanced severance is provided on a termination in connection with a change in control. Kraft Heinz does not have a specified Change in Control Plan for executives, and treatment is
determined by the plan agreements and local regulations applicable to each employee. Our Severance Pay Plan generally provides for 12 months of base salary with a signed release of claims.
The Severance Pay Plan would also include Company-paid COBRA for U.S.-based employees for the severance period and outplacement services.

(2) Relates to termination due to death, disability, or normal retirement.

(3) As of the last day of 2018, in the event of a termination without cause or due to retirement, death, or disability, stock options vest as if 20% of the options vested on each annual anniversary date
of the specific grant. Amounts reflect the intrinsic value of shares underlying options that would vest, calculated as the difference between $43.57, the closing price of Kraft Heinz common stock
on December 28, 2018 (the last trading day of our fiscal year, as reported on Nasdaq), and the exercise price of the options. Amounts also include the vesting of Matching RSUs granted in 2016
at a pro rata rate of 20% of the RSUs as if they vested on each annual anniversary date of the grant. The 2017 Matching RSUs and 2018 RSUs and Matching RSUs are not presented in this table
because no pro rata vesting would occur if such event occurs prior to the second anniversary of the grant.

(4) Amount reflects 12 months of medical and dental benefit coverage continuation under COBRA, less the executive premium contribution. As noted in the CD&A, due to the difficult operating
environment in 2018 and the Company’s financial performance, Messrs. Hees, Knopf, and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal
year 2018 and the Committee approved their forfeitures.

237

(5) The Committee and Board approved a bonus to Mr. Hees in connection with his separation from the Company, $1,084,000, which represents his pro rata portion of his 2019 bonus based on an

85% performance rating and 85% Individual Rating.

Severance Pay Plan

Generally, Kraft Heinz provides for severance benefits to U.S.-based salaried employees, including our U.S.-based NEOs, pursuant to the terms of the U.S.
Severance  Pay  Plan.  The  severance  benefits  for  non-U.S.-based  salaried  employees  are  made  pursuant  to  the  local  laws  and  regulations  governing  the
jurisdiction in which they work, subject to adjustment at the discretion of Kraft Heinz for employees at certain organizational levels (such benefits, together
with the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, are referred to as the “Severance Pay Plan”).

NEOs are eligible for severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan upon an involuntary termination of employment, such as job elimination, location
closing, or reduction in the workforce. NEOs must be willing to provide satisfactory transitional assistance in order to be eligible for severance benefits.

Pursuant to the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, Messrs. Hees, Basilio, and Knopf and Ms. La Lande would generally be eligible to receive a severance payment
equal  to  12  months  of  base  salary  upon  the  execution  of  a  release  of  claims  against  Kraft  Heinz.  In  addition,  the  Committee  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,
authorize  payment  of  additional  severance  in  respect  of  a  participant’s  annual  bonus  opportunity.  Although  Mr.  Oliveira  is  not  based  in  the  U.S.  and  not
otherwise covered by the U.S. Severance Pay Plan, the Company has determined that he is eligible to receive the same benefits as the other NEOs. Severance
payments are generally made in a cash lump-sum, but may occasionally be made in periodic payments at Kraft Heinz’s discretion as soon as administratively
feasible after the termination of employment and after the former NEO’s executed release has become irrevocable.

On  April  22,  2019,  Kraft  Heinz  announced  that  Mr.  Hees  would  leave  Kraft  Heinz  in  2019.  On  June  5,  2019,  the  Committee  approved  the  following
severance terms for Mr. Hees, which will become payable following Mr. Hees’s termination of employment and subject to his execution of a release of claims
against Kraft Heinz: (1) a severance payment equal to 12 months of base salary, and (2) a pro-rata payment of his annual bonus under the PBP assuming
performance at 85%, both with respect to the metrics related to Kraft Heinz’s financial performance (i.e., the “Financial Multiplier”) and Mr. Hees’s MBOs
(i.e.,  the  “Individual  Rating”).  Mr.  Hees’  outstanding  equity  awards  will  be  treated  in  accordance  with  the  terms  set  forth  in  the  governing  agreements  as
described below.

No enhanced severance is provided on a termination in connection with a change in control of Kraft Heinz, and Kraft Heinz does not maintain any individual
change in control severance or other similar agreements with any of the NEOs. None of the NEOs are entitled to receive a gross-up for golden parachute taxes
that may become payable pursuant to Section 280G of the Code in connection with a change in control of Kraft Heinz.

Equity Awards

Generally, as of the last day of 2018, in the event of involuntary termination without cause, retirement, death, and disability, the stock options granted to the
NEOs  would  vest  as  if  20%  of  the  shares  vested  on  each  annual  anniversary  date  of  the  specific  grant,  and  for  all  other  terminations  and  for  voluntary
resignations, the unvested stock options would be forfeited. In addition, as of the last day of 2018, beginning on the termination date, the exercise period was
90  days  for  termination  without  cause  and  one  year  for  retirement,  death,  and  disability.  In  April  2019,  the  Committee  modified  award  agreements  for
outstanding equity awards (options, PSUs, Matching RSUs, and RSUs) with respect to the treatment upon a termination due to death, disability, or retirement.
Such  terminations,  for  option  awards  on  or  after  the  first  anniversary  of  the  specific  grant  date,  and  for  RSU  and  Matching  RSU  awards  on  or  after  the
anniversary deadlines outlined in the award agreements, would result in such awards being fully vested and exercisable, in the case of PSUs, to the extent the
performance conditions had been satisfied. In addition, the Committee modified award agreements for outstanding options such that the exercise period for a
termination without cause would be one year.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE

In  accordance  with  Item  402(u)  of  Regulation  S-K,  promulgated  by  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  Act  and  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  2010,  we
determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Hees relative to the annual total compensation of our median employee.

For  purposes  of  reporting  annual  total  compensation  and  the  ratio  of  annual  total  compensation  of  the  CEO  to  the  median  employee,  both  the  CEO  and
median  employee’s  annual  total  compensation  were  calculated  consistent  with  the  disclosure  requirements  of  executive  compensation  under  the  Summary
Compensation Table.

238

Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, because there has been no significant change in our employee population or employee
compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure, we are utilizing the same median-
compensated employee in our pay ratio calculation as was used in 2017. Our median-compensated employee is a full-time hourly non-U.S. factory employee.

To identify our median employee last year, we determined the annual total compensation by examining the 2017 annualized base salaries plus target incentive
bonus for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us as of December 1, 2017. In accordance with Item 402(u) and
instructions  thereto,  we  included  all  full-time,  part-time,  temporary,  and  seasonal  employees  worldwide.  We  believe  the  use  of  base  salaries  plus  target
incentive bonus for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure, because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees
and because we believe that this measure reasonably reflects the total annual compensation of our employees.

After applying the methodology described above, our median employee compensation using the Summary Compensation Table requirements was $47,612.
Our CEO’s compensation in the Summary Compensation Table was $29,047,768. Therefore, our CEO to median employee pay ratio (“CEO pay ratio”), a
reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u), is 610:1. The CEO’s total compensation of $29,047,768 included $1,060,000 payable
pursuant to the PBP for 2018, as well as $17,838,582 related to the grant date fair value of PSUs. As noted above, Mr. Hees has decided to forfeit the PBP for
2018,  and  as  of  December  29,  2018,  the  expected  payout  of  those  PSUs  was  determined  to  be  zero  based  on  the  probability  of  future  achievement  of
performance metrics. If we had excluded the PBP payout for 2018 and the March 2018 PSUs from total CEO compensation, the CEO pay ratio would have
been 213:1.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

INDEPENDENCE AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS

Independence Determinations

The  Guidelines  require  that  a  majority  of  the  directors  meet  Nasdaq  listing  standards’  “independence”  requirements.  For  a  director  to  be  considered
independent, the Board must affirmatively determine, after reviewing all relevant information, that a director has no direct or indirect material relationship
with Kraft Heinz that would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. The Board
determined  that,  under  the  Nasdaq  listing  standards,  the  following  director  nominees  are  independent:  Mr.  Abel,  Mr.  Behring,  Ms.  Cool,  Mr.  Dewan,  Ms.
Jackson, Mr. Lemann, Mr. Pope, Mr. Castro-Neves, and Mr. Van Damme. Warren Buffett and Mackey McDonald, who retired from Board service in 2018,
and Marcel Herrmann Telles, who decided to retire from the Board, effective on June 12, 2019, were also determined to be independent during the periods
they served. Mr. Cahill, the former Chief Executive Officer of Kraft and a current consultant to Kraft Heinz, and George Zoghbi, our former Chief Operating
Officer of the U.S. Commercial business and Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, are not independent.

In conducting its evaluations of Mr. Abel, Mr. Buffett, and Ms. Cool, the Board considered each individual’s affiliation with Berkshire Hathaway, which held
approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2019, and its subsidiaries. Similarly, in conducting its evaluations of Mr. Behring, Mr.
Lemann,  Mr.  Castro-Neves,  and  Mr.  Telles,  the  Board  considered  each  individual’s  affiliation  with  3G  Capital,  which  held  approximately  22%  of  our
outstanding common stock as of June 5, 2019, and its subsidiaries. The Board also considered the service of Messrs. Behring, Castro-Neves, and Van Damme
on the Board of Directors of RBI, a company in which 3G Capital invests and the parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons, quick service restaurant
companies that purchase certain of our products and conduct certain brand sponsorship and marketing activities for us, in conducting its evaluations of them.

Review of Transactions with Related Persons

The Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval, or ratification of “related person transactions.” A “related person transaction” is one in
which  Kraft  Heinz  is  a  participant,  the  amount  involved  exceeds  $120,000,  and  any  “related  person”  had,  has,  or  will  have  a  direct  or  indirect  material
interest. In general, “related persons” include our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their immediate family members. In accordance with
this policy, the Governance Committee reviews transactions that might qualify as “related person transactions.” If the Governance Committee determines that
a transaction qualifies as a “related person transaction,” then the Governance Committee reviews, and approves, disapproves, or ratifies the “related person
transaction.” The Governance Committee approves or ratifies only those “related person transactions” that are fair and reasonable to Kraft Heinz and in our
and our stockholders’ best interests. Any member of the Governance Committee who is a “related person” with respect to a transaction under review may not
participate in the deliberations or decisions regarding the transaction. The chair of the Governance Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee if the
chair of the Governance Committee is a “related person” with respect to the transaction under review) will review and approve or ratify potential “related
person transactions” when it is not practicable or desirable to delay review of a transaction until a Governance Committee meeting, and will report to the
Governance  Committee  any  transaction  so  approved  or  ratified.  The  Governance  Committee,  in  the  course  of  its  review  and  approval  or  ratification  of  a
related person transaction under this policy, considers, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

the commercial reasonableness of the transaction;

the materiality of the related person’s direct or indirect interest in the transaction;

whether the transaction may involve an actual, or the appearance of a, conflict of interest;

the impact of the transaction on the related person’s independence (as defined in the Guidelines and the Nasdaq listing standards); and

whether the transaction would violate any provision of our Directors Ethics Code or Code of Conduct.

241

Registration Rights Agreement

In connection with the 2015 Merger, we entered into a registration rights agreement with 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the
registration  rights  agreement,  we  granted  3G  Global  Food  Holdings  and  Berkshire  Hathaway  registration  rights  with  respect  to  the  shares  of  Kraft  Heinz
common stock held by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger, representing shares of Kraft Heinz
common stock acquired from Heinz in connection with the 2015 Merger and/or immediately prior to the 2015 Merger pursuant to a warrant. The registration
rights  only  apply  to  registrable  shares  and  not  shares  of  Kraft  Heinz  common  stock  subsequently  acquired  by  either  party.  These  rights  include  demand
registration  rights,  shelf  registration  rights,  and  “piggyback”  registration  rights,  as  well  as  customary  indemnification.  The  rights  are  subject  to  certain
holdback  and  suspension  periods.  We  generally  will  bear  all  fees,  costs,  and  expenses  related  to  registrations,  other  than  underwriting  discounts  and
commissions attributable to the sale of shares of Kraft Heinz common stock by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway, as applicable.

Demand Registration Rights

The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway demand registration rights. We will be required, upon the
written request of 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway, to file a registration statement pursuant to its demand rights under the registration rights
agreement,  as  promptly  as  practicable  and  to  use  our  reasonable  best  efforts  to  effect  registration  of  shares  of  Kraft  Heinz  common  stock  requested  to  be
registered by 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway, subject to certain exceptions. Each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway
may request up to three demand registrations in the aggregate.

Shelf Registration Rights

The registration rights agreement also grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway shelf registration rights. Subject to our eligibility to
use a Registration Statement on Form S-3, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway may request that we file a shelf registration statement
with respect to some or all of its shares of Kraft Heinz common stock, and, upon such request, we are required to file such registration statement promptly as
practicable, subject to certain exceptions.

“Piggyback” Registration Rights

The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway “piggyback” registration rights. If we register any of our
shares of common stock, either for our own account or for the account of other stockholders, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway will
be entitled, subject to certain exceptions, to include its shares of common stock in the registration.

Holdback Periods

Notwithstanding the registration rights described above, if there is an offering of shares of Kraft Heinz and the managing underwriters for the offering advise
us that a public sale or distribution of shares outside the offering would adversely affect the offering, then, if requested, each of 3G Global Food Holdings and
Berkshire Hathaway will not dispose of, or request the registration of, any registrable shares for a certain period, which we refer to as a holdback period. The
holdback period will begin on the 10th day before the pricing date of the offering and extend for either (i) 120 days or (ii) an earlier date, if designated by the
managing underwriters.

Suspension Periods

In addition, we may delay or suspend the filing, effectiveness, or use of a registration statement for a certain period, which we refer to as a suspension period,
if we determine that (i) proceeding with the use or effectiveness of the registration statement would require us to disclose material non-public information and
the disclosure of that information at that time would not be in our best interests or (ii) the registration or offering to be delayed or suspended would, if not
delayed  or  suspended,  materially  adversely  affect  us  or  delay  or  otherwise  materially  adversely  affect  the  success  of  any  pending  or  proposed  material
transaction,  including  any  debt  or  equity  financing,  any  acquisition  or  disposition,  any  recapitalization  or  reorganization  or  any  other  material  transaction,
whether due to commercial reasons, a desire to avoid premature disclosure of information, or any other reason. During any calendar year, there will not be
more than two suspension periods and the aggregate number of days included in all suspension periods in that year will not exceed 119 days.

242

Shareholders’ Agreement

In connection with the 2015 Merger, 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a shareholders’ agreement that governs how each party
and their affiliates will vote the shares of Kraft Heinz common stock held by them as of the date of closing of the 2015 Merger, with respect to supporting
certain directors who are designated by either 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement, 3G Global Food
Holdings agrees that for so long as Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates control shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in election of directors
of shares owned by Berkshire Hathaway as of the consummation of the 2015 Merger, 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates will vote their shares of
Kraft  Heinz  common  stock  in  favor  of  the  three  Kraft  Heinz  Board  nominees  designated  by  Berkshire  Hathaway  and  not  take  any  action  to  remove  such
designees without Berkshire Hathaway’s consent. Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway agrees that for so long as 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates control
shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in elections of directors of shares owned by 3G Global Food Holdings as of the consummation of the
2015 Merger, Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates will vote their shares of Kraft Heinz common stock in favor of the three Kraft Heinz Board nominees
designated by 3G Global Food Holdings and not take any action to remove such designees without 3G Global Food Holdings’ consent. The shareholders’
agreement  provides  that  each  party’s  foregoing  rights  and  obligations  will  step  down  upon  specified  reductions  in  ownership  below  the  66%  threshold
described above by either 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway and their respective affiliates, as applicable.

Consulting Agreement

On November 2, 2017, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Cahill pursuant to which he provides advisory and consulting services to us related to
current  and  historical  finances,  relationships  with  licensors,  customers  and  vendors,  employee  matters,  product  development,  marketing  and  distribution,
government  affairs  and  strategic  opportunities.  Mr.  Cahill  is  paid  $500,000  annually  under  this  new  consulting  agreement,  which  was  approved  by  the
disinterested members of the Board. Mr. Cahill’s services under the consulting agreement are distinct from his duties as a director. Previously, Mr. Cahill had
provided similar services under a consulting agreement entered into following the 2015 Merger, which had expired in July 2017.

Compensation Arrangement

Effective January 1, 2017, the Company entered into an offer letter (the “Offer Letter”) with Mr. Zoghbi in order to incent Mr. Zoghbi to extend his service
with the Company past January 1, 2017, after a retention bonus pursuant to a prior offer letter entered into upon the closing of the 2015 Merger had been
earned. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Zoghbi: (i) continued his current base salary of $850,000; (ii) agreed to a 2017 target annual incentive award opportunity
of 200% (with a maximum bonus multiplier of 130%); and (iii) was granted a long-term equity incentive award. The long-term equity incentive award was
composed  of  (i)  RSUs,  which  cliff  vest  after  three  years,  and  (ii)  PSUs,  which  cliff  vest  after  three  years  based  on  the  achievement  of  U.S.  sales  growth
targets and U.S. Adjusted EBITDA growth targets. The Offer Letter also eliminated the Section 280G gross-up rights that Mr. Zoghbi had been granted by
Kraft compensation plans prior to the 2015 Merger. In October 2017, Mr. Zoghbi transitioned from his role as President of the U.S. Commercial business to
his role as Special Advisor. As previously disclosed, Mr. Zoghbi was not eligible under the Offer Letter for an annual incentive award in 2018 based on 2017
performance. For as long as Mr. Zoghbi continues to serve as a Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz, it is anticipated that he will not receive compensation for his
services as a director.

Pre-Approval Policy

The  Audit  Committee’s  policy  is  to  pre-approve  all  audit  and  non-audit  services  provided  by  the  independent  auditors.  These  services  may  include  audit
services, audit-related services, tax services, and other permissible non-audit services. The pre-approval authority details the particular service or category of
service  that  the  independent  auditors  will  perform.  The  Audit  Committee’s  policy  also  requires  management  to  report  at  Audit  Committee  meetings
throughout the year on the actual fees charged by the independent auditors for each category of service. The Audit Committee reviews this policy annually.

During the year, circumstances may arise when it may be necessary to engage the independent auditors for additional services not contemplated in the original
pre-approval authority. In those instances, the Audit Committee approves the services before we engage the independent auditors. If pre-approval is needed
before a scheduled Audit Committee meeting, the Audit Committee delegated pre-approval authority to its chair. The chair must report on such pre-approval
decisions at the committee’s next regular meeting.

During fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors.

DESCRIPTION OF KRAFT HEINZ’S SECURITIES

The following description is a summary that is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Kraft Heinz’s Second Amended and

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (“Certificate of Incorporation”) and Kraft Heinz’s Amended and Restated By-Laws (“By-Laws”).

General

Kraft Heinz is authorized to issue five billion (5,000,000,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and nine hundred twenty thousand

(920,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

     Under the Certificate of Incorporation, Kraft Heinz may issue preferred stock in one or more series, with preferences, limitations and rights as authorized

by Kraft Heinz’s board of directors, to the extent permitted by Delaware law. The powers (including voting, if any), preferences and relative, participating,

optional and other special rights of each series of preferred stock, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any

and all other classes and series of preferred stock at any time outstanding. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of Kraft Heinz’s

common shareholders by, among other things:

•

•

•

•

restricting dividends on the common stock;

diluting the voting power of the common stock;

impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock; or

delaying or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders.

As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of Kraft Heinz’s common

stock. Kraft Heinz’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the ticker symbol “KHC.” All outstanding shares of

common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

Dividend and Liquidation Rights

Subject to the preferences applicable to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at any time, holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock are entitled to

receive dividends when and as declared by its board of directors from assets or funds legally available therefore. The timing, declaration, amount and

payment of future dividends will depend on Kraft Heinz’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt service obligations, as well as legal

requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that Kraft Heinz’s board of directors deems relevant. Kraft Heinz’s board of directors

will make all decisions regarding the payment of dividends from time to time in accordance with applicable law. Subject to any preferential liquidation rights

of holders of preferred stock that may be outstanding, upon Kraft Heinz’s dissolution, the holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock will be entitled to share

ratably in Kraft Heinz’s assets legally available for distribution to Kraft Heinz’s stockholders.

Voting and Other Rights

Each share of common stock outstanding is entitled to one vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. However, except

as required by law, holders of common stock are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of

one or more outstanding class or series of preferred stock if the

1

holders of such affected class or series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such class or series, to vote thereon

pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or the Delaware General Corporation Law.

The By-Laws provide that, except as required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which Kraft Heinz’s

capital stock is listed, all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the shareholders shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders

entitled to vote thereon who are present in person or represented by proxy, and where a separate vote by class or series is required, a majority of the votes cast

by the shareholders of such class or series who are present in person or represented by proxy shall be the act of such class or series; provided that the election

of directors shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast or a plurality.

The holders of Kraft Heinz’s common stock have no preemptive rights and no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities. Kraft

Heinz’s common stock is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions.

Anti-takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws

 General

 The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws contain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the

composition of the board of directors and that could make it more difficult to acquire control of the company by means of a tender offer, open market

purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. A description of these provisions is set forth below.

 No Cumulative Voting

 Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative voting.

The Certificate of Incorporation does not grant shareholders the right to vote cumulatively.

 Blank Check Preferred Stock

 We believe that the availability of the preferred stock under the Certificate of Incorporation provides the company with flexibility in addressing

corporate issues that may arise. Having these authorized shares available for issuance will allow the company to issue shares of preferred stock without the

expense and delay of a special shareholders’ meeting. The authorized shares of preferred stock, as well as shares of common stock, will be available for

issuance without further action by the company’s shareholders, with the exception of any actions required by applicable law or the rules of any stock

exchange on which Kraft Heinz’s securities may be listed. The board of directors will have the power, subject to applicable law, to issue classes or series of

preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the class or series, impede the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt.

  Shareholder Action by Written Consent

 The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of

Kraft Heinz may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are

signed by the holders of outstanding capital stock of Kraft Heinz having not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize such action at a

meeting at which all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT

Exhibit 10.15

Unless  defined  in  this  award  agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices  attached  thereto,  this  “Award  Agreement”),
capitalized terms will have the same meanings ascribed to them in the The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as may be
amended from time to time, the “Plan”).

Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted a Non-Qualified Stock Option (the “Option”) as of
the Grant Date set forth below (the “Grant Date”). The Option entitles you to exercise up to the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s
Common Stock set forth below, at the Exercise Price per share set forth below (the “Exercise Price”) on the following terms and subject to the
provisions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award
Agreement, the provisions of the Plan will govern.

Total Number of Shares Underlying Options:

______________ Shares

Current Grant Value of Shares Underlying Options:    $_____ per Share

Exercise Price per Share:                $_____ per Share

Grant Date:                        ______________

Expiration Date:                    10-year anniversary of Grant Date

Vesting Date:

5-year anniversary of Grant Date (subject to the terms of the Award Agreement)

By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that this Option is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  on  Exhibit  A,  the  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.

EXHIBIT A

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE

OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT

Vesting

This Option will vest and become exercisable on the “Vesting Date” set forth in this Award Agreement. Any portion of this Option that
becomes exercisable in accordance with the foregoing will remain exercisable until the Expiration Date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to
the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below entitled “Termination”).

Exercisability

Subject to the section below entitled “Termination,” this Option may be exercised only while you are employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Prior to the exercise of this Option, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to this Option or
the Shares subject thereto.

This  Option  will  be  exercisable  pursuant  to  procedures  approved  by  the  Committee  and  communicated  to  you.  No  Shares  will  be
delivered pursuant to the exercise of this Option unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan,
(ii) the exercise of this Option and the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law and (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision
therefor) of the aggregate exercise price of the Option and any Tax-Related Items (as defined below) have been received by the Company. Until
such time as the Shares are delivered to you, you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect
to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of this Option.

Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Company  or  Committee,  this  Option  may  only  be  exercised  on  a  day  on  which  the  NASDAQ
National Market (the “Exchange”) is open. Accordingly, if the Expiration Date is a day on which the Exchange is closed, the Expiration Date
shall be the immediately preceding day on which the Exchange is open.

Termination

Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting and Exercisability

Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit this Option

without any consideration due to you.

If the Company terminates your Service prior to the Vesting Date Without Cause (as defined below), your Option shall be vested in the
number of Shares as if 20% of the Shares subject to the Option vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date. If your Service terminates
by reason of your death, Retirement or Disability (as defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, your Option shall be
fully vested and exercisable. You (or, if applicable, such other person who is entitled to exercise this Option) may exercise the Option or such
portion(s) thereof that have vested based on the completed numbers of full years from the Vesting Date as set forth in the table below.

To the extent this Option is or becomes exercisable on the date of termination of your Service, then, if you (or, if applicable, such other
person who is entitled to exercise this Option) do not exercise this Option on or prior to the expiration of the Option Exercise Period (as set
forth below), this Option will terminate; provided that in no event may you exercise this Option after the Expiration Date.

Applicable Definitions

For purposes of this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

“Disability” means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering  you  or  (ii)  in  the  absence  of  any  such  policy,  a  physical  or  mental  condition  rendering  you  unable  to  perform  your  duties  for  the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment  Agreement  at  the  time  of  termination  of  your  Service  and  such  Employment  Agreement  contains  a  different  definition  of
“disability” (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.

“Retirement” means a termination of Service by you on or after either (a) the later of (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your completion of
five years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates or (b) the later of (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your completion of ten
years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.

“Without Cause” means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines “Good
Reason”,  then  “Without  Cause”  shall  also  include  resignation  of  your  Service  for  “Good  Reason”  in  accordance  with  such  Employment
Agreement.

Special Termination Provisions

In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on

this Option and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

If  you  are  terminated  Without  Cause  or  due  to  your  resignation  and,  within  the  twelve  (12)  month  period  subsequent  to  such
termination  of  your  Service,  the  Company  determines  that  your  Service  could  have  been  terminated  for  Cause,  subject  to  anything  to  the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).

Effect of a Change in Control

The treatment of the Options upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan. In the event that there is a conflict between the
terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a Change in Control on this Option and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the
terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

Restrictive Covenants

Your  Service  will  provide  you  with  specialized  training  and  unique  knowledge  and  access  to  confidential  information  and  key  business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in partial consideration of the Option granted under this Award Agreement, you agree to comply with the Company’s Restrictive Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.

Taxes

Regardless  of  any  action  the  Company  takes  with  respect  to  any  or  all  income  tax,  social  security  or  insurance,  payroll  tax,  fringe
benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all
Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option grant, including
the grant, vesting or exercise of this Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends
and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of this Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.

Prior to exercise of this Option, you will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation  paid  to  you  by  the  Company  and/or  its  Subsidiaries  or  from  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  Shares.  Alternatively,  or  in  addition,  if
permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet
the obligation for Tax-Related Items. Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries any amount of Tax-Related Items that the
Company or its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan or your purchase of Shares that cannot be
satisfied  by  the  means  previously  described.  The  Company  may  refuse  to  honor  the  exercise  and  refuse  to  deliver  the  Shares  if  you  fail  to
comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.

No Guarantee of Continued Service.

You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of this Option on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above
titled “Termination”) is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You
further acknowledge and agree that this Award Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Date shall not be construed
as giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.
Further, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss you, free from any liability, or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the applicable Affiliate. The
receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.

Company’s Right of Offset

If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award

In accepting this Option, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:

(a)    the  Plan  is  established  voluntarily  by  the  Company,  it  is  discretionary  in  nature  and  may  be  modified,  amended,  suspended  or

terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;

(b)        the  Option  award  is  exceptional,  voluntary,  occasional  and  discretionary  and  does  not  create  any  contractual  or  other  right  to

receive future Option awards, or benefits in lieu of Options even if Options have been awarded in the past;

(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(e)    this Option is an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the

Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates;

(f)        this  Option,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan,  and  the  income  and  value  of  same  are  not  part  of  normal  or  expected
compensation  or  salary  for  purposes  of  calculating  any  severance,  resignation,  termination,  redundancy,  end  of  service  payments,  bonuses,
long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;

(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(h)    if the underlying Shares do not increase in value, this Option will have no value;

(i)    if you receive Shares, the value of such Shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise

Price per Share;

(j)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Options, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value

of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;

(k)    no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from termination of your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment  Agreement,  if  any),  and  in  consideration  of  the  grant  of  the  Option  to  which  you  are
otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your
ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and

(l)        this  Option  is  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  certain  provisions  regarding  Adjustments,

Repurchases and Transfers).

Securities Laws

By accepting this Option, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding
trading  in  its  securities  may  limit  or  restrict  your  right  to  buy  or  sell  Shares,  including,  without  limitation,  sales  of  Shares  acquired  in
connection with this Option. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries

This Option shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death, and this Option shall be
exercised during your lifetime only by you or your guardian or legal representative, except that this Option may be Transferred to one or more
Beneficiaries  or  other  Transferees  during  your  lifetime  with  the  consent  of  the  Committee,  and  may  be  exercised  by  such  Transferees  in
accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Award  Agreement.  A  Beneficiary,  Transferee,  or  other  person  claiming  any  rights  under  this  Award
Agreement  shall  be  subject  to  all  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Plan  and  this  Award  Agreement,  except  as  otherwise  determined  by  the
Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of this Option shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the written agreement of the Transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions applicable to this Option and any Shares purchased upon
exercise of this Option that are or would have been applicable to you.

Repayment/Forfeiture

As  an  additional  condition  of  receiving  the  Options  and  without  prejudice  to  the  terms  of  the  Company's  Restrictive  Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the Options and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture  and/or  repayment  to  the  Company  to  the  extent  required  (i)  under  the  terms  of  any  policy  adopted  by  the  Company  as  may  be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply  with  any  requirements  imposed  under  applicable  laws  and/or  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  securities  exchange  or  inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the Options for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about
this  Award  Agreement  prohibits  you  from:  (i)  filing  and,  as  provided  for  under  Section  21F  of  the  Act,  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  a
claim with the Commission, (ii) providing the Commission with information that would otherwise violate the non-disclosure restrictions in this
Award Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 21F of the Act; (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in a Commission investigation
or proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore, you are
advised that you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential
Information (as defined in Exhibit B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies
that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely
for  the  purpose  of  reporting  or  investigating  a  suspected  violation  of  law;  or  (ii)  in  a  complaint  or  other  document  filed  in  a  lawsuit  or
proceeding, if such filings are made under seal.

Section 409A

It is intended that the Option awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”)
because it is believed that (i) the Exercise Price per Share may never be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date and the
number of Shares subject to the Option is fixed on the original Grant Date, (ii) the Transfer or exercise of the Option is subject to taxation under
Section 83 of the Code and Treasury Regulation 1.83-7, and (iii) the Option does not include any feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the exercise of the Option. The provisions of this Award Agreement shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with this intention. In the event that the Company believes, at any time, that any benefit or right under this Award Agreement
is subject to Section 409A, then the Committee may (acting alone and without any required consent by you) amend this Award Agreement in
such manner as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to be exempt from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A
(including without limitation, amending the Award Agreement to increase the Exercise Price per Share to such amount as may be required in
order for the Option to be exempt from Section 409A).

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  do  not  make  any  representation  to  you  that  the  Option
awarded  pursuant  to  this  Award  Agreement  shall  be  exempt  from  or  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Section  409A,  and  the  Company,  its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party  for  any  tax,  additional  tax,  interest  or  penalties  that  you  or  any  Beneficiary,  Transferee  or  other  party  may  incur  in  the  event  that  any
provision  of  this  Award  Agreement,  or  any  amendment  or  modification  thereof  or  any  other  action  taken  with  respect  thereto,  is  deemed  to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.

Entire Agreement; Modification

The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations

This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,

without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any  litigation  based  on,  arising  out  of,  under  or  in  connection  with  this  Award  Agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.

consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and  maintained  by  the  Company  or  a  third  party  designated  by  the  Company.  The  Award  Agreement  if  delivered  by  electronic  means  with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.

Agreement Severable

This  Award  Agreement  shall  be  enforceable  to  the  fullest  extent  allowed  by  law.  In  the  event  that  any  provision  of  this  Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render it
valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the validity,
legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable
in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as  to  such  jurisdiction,  be  deemed  severable  from  the  remainder  of  this  Award  Agreement,  and  the  remaining
provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent and purposes of this
Award Agreement.

EXHIBIT B

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT

I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its  Affiliates  (collectively  the  “Company”),  and  will  learn  and  have  access  to  the  Company’s  confidential,  trade  secret  and  proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the “Agreement”) are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me a stock option or other equity grant unless I
made such promises.

In addition to other good and valuable consideration, I am expressly being given a stock option or other equity grant in exchange for

my agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the “Executive”) agree as follows:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive’s Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential  Information.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  “Confidential  Information”  means  all  data,  information,  ideas,  concepts,
discoveries,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable  or  reduced  to  practice),  innovations,  improvements,  know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies,  and  all  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information  or  trade  secrets  in  any  form  or  medium  (whether  merely  remembered  or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential  business,  activities  and/or  operations  of  the  Company,  including,  without  limitation,  any  such  information  relating  to  or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive’s assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during  the  period  of  Executive’s  Service  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  any  Confidential  Information  or  other  confidential  or  proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use  such  information  only  for  certain  limited  purposes,  in  each  case,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  Executive  during  Executive’s
Service. The  foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  information  that  (i)  was  known  to  the  public  prior  to  its  disclosure  to  Executive;  (ii)  becomes
generally  known  to  the  public  subsequent  to  disclosure  to  Executive  through  no  wrongful  act  of  Executive  or  any  representative  of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).

Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade  secret  law  for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  is  made  in  confidence  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade  secrets  in  a  complaint,  or  other  document,  filed  in  a  lawsuit,  or  other  proceeding,  if  such  filing  is  made  under  seal.  Finally,  if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

No  Company  policies  or  practices,  including  this  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  provision,  is  intended  to  or  shall  limit,
prevent,  impede  or  interfere  in  any  way  with  Executive’s  right,  without  prior  notice  to  the  Company,  to  provide  information  to  the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company’s past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.

2. NON-COMPETITION.  Executive  acknowledges  that  (i)  Executive  performs  services  of  a  unique  nature  for  the  Company  that  are
irreplaceable, and that Executive’s performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company,
(ii) Executive has had and will continue to have access to Confidential Information which, if disclosed, would unfairly and inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive’s employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  these  customers,  (v)  Executive  has  received  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive’s Service.
Accordingly, during Executive’s Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive’s Service for any reason (the
“Restricted  Period”),  Executive  will  not  engage  in  any  business  activities,  directly  or  indirectly  (whether  as  an  employee,  consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the  Company  in  the  consumer  packaged  food  and  beverage  industry  (“Competitive  Business”)  anywhere  within  the  same  geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the “Restricted Territory”). Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
nothing  herein  shall  prohibit  Executive  from  being  a  passive  owner  of  not  more  than  three  percent  (3%)  of  the  equity  securities  of  a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.

3. NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive’s
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive’s termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive’s employment with the Company.

4. NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive’s
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render  services  to  or  with  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  unaffiliated  with  the  Company  or  hire  or  retain  any  such
employee,  representative  or  agent,  or  take  any  action  to  materially  assist  or  aid  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term “solicit, aid or
induce”  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  (i)  initiating  communications  with  a  Company  employee  relating  to  possible  employment,  (ii)
offering  bonuses  or  other  compensation  to  encourage  a  Company  employee  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  with  the  Company  and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.

5. NON-DISPARAGEMENT.  Executive  agrees  not  to  make  negative  comments  or  otherwise  disparage  the  Company  or  its  officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response  to  legal  process,  required  governmental  testimony  or  filings,  or  administrative  or  arbitral  proceedings  (including,  without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive’s duties to the Company.

6.

INVENTIONS.

a. Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software,  know-how,  processes,  techniques,  methods,  works  of  authorship  and  other  work  product  (“Inventions”),  whether
patentable  or  unpatentable,  (A)  that  are  reduced  to  practice,  created,  invented,  designed,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  improved
with  the  use  of  any  Company  resources  and/or  within  the  scope  of  Executive’s  work  with  the  Company  or  that  relate  to  the
business,  operations  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company,  and  that  are  made  or
conceived  by  Executive,  solely  or  jointly  with  others,  during  Executive’s  Service,  or  (B)  suggested  by  any  work  that  Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive’s duties with the Company or on Executive’s own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive’s work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall  belong  exclusively  to  the  Company  (or  its  designee),  whether  or  not  patent  or  other  applications  for  intellectual  property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the “Records”), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company’s request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive’s Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive’s name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent  rights  (the  “Applications”).  Executive  will,  at  any  time  during  and  subsequent  to  Executive’s  Service,  make  such
applications,  sign  such  papers,  take  all  rightful  oaths,  and  perform  all  other  acts  as  may  be  requested  from  time  to  time  by  the
Company  to  perfect,  record,  enforce,  protect,  patent  or  register  the  Company’s  rights  in  the  Inventions,  all  without  additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions  for  the  Company’s  benefit,  all  without  additional  compensation  to  Executive  from  the  Company,  but  entirely  at  the
Company’s expense.

b.

In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise  automatically  vest  in  the  Company,  Executive  hereby  irrevocably  conveys,  transfers  and  assigns  to  the  Company,  all
rights,  in  all  media  now  known  or  hereinafter  devised,  throughout  the  universe  and  in  perpetuity,  in  and  to  the  Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive’s right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called “moral rights” with respect to the Inventions.
To  the  extent  that  Executive  has  any  rights  in  the  results  and  proceeds  of  Executive’s  service  to  the  Company  that  cannot  be
assigned  in  the  manner  described  herein,  Executive  agrees  to  unconditionally  waive  the  enforcement  of  such  rights.  Executive
hereby  waives  any  and  all  currently  existing  and  future  monetary  rights  in  and  to  the  Inventions  and  all  patents  and  other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon,

including,  without  limitation,  any  rights  that  would  otherwise  accrue  to  Executive’s  benefit  by  virtue  of  Executive  being  an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.

7. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive’s termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company’s request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).

8. REASONABLENESS  OF  COVENANTS.  In  signing  this  Agreement,  including  by  electronic  means,  Executive  gives  the  Company
assurance  that  Executive  has  carefully  read  and  considered  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  restraints
imposed  by  it.  Executive  agrees  that  these  restraints  are  necessary  for  the  reasonable  and  proper  protection  of  the  Company  and  its
Confidential  Information  and  that  each  and  every  one  of  the  restraints  is  reasonable  in  respect  to  subject  matter,  length  of  time  and
geographic  area,  and  that  these  restraints,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  will  not  prevent  Executive  from  obtaining  other  suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any  of  the  covenants  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  and  that  Executive  will  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  costs  (including  reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.  It  is  also  agreed  that  the  “Company”  as  used  in  this  Agreement  refers  to  each  of  the  Company’s  Subsidiaries  and

Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.

9. REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is

may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.

10. REMEDIES.  Executive  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company’s  remedies  at  law  for  a  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  any  of  the
provisions  of  Agreement  would  be  inadequate  and,  in  recognition  of  this  fact,  Executive  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable  relief  in  the  form  of  specific  performance,  a  temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction  or  any  other
equitable  remedy  which  may  then  be  available,  without  the  necessity  of  showing  actual  monetary  damages,  in  addition  to  any  other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.

11. REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a “Covenant Breach” as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive’s Option and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

12. TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

13. SURVIVAL  OF  PROVISIONS.  The  obligations  contained  in  this  Agreement hereof  shall  survive  the  termination  or  expiration  of  the

14. VENUE,  PERSONAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  COVENANT  NOT  TO  SUE.  Executive  expressly  agrees  to  submit  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect  to  a  dispute  between  the  Company  and  Executive  in  relation  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement,  regardless  of  where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive’s rights, if any,
to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement decided in any jurisdiction or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction,  application,  validity,  and  enforcement  of  this  Agreement,  and  any  disputes  or  controversies  arising  hereunder,  will  be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern this Option granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside
the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another  country  after  this  Option  is  granted  to  you,  or  are  considered  a  resident  of  another  country  for  local  law  purposes,  the  terms  and
conditions  contained  herein  may  not  be  applicable  to  you,  and  the  Company  shall,  in  its  discretion,  determine  to  what  extent  the  terms  and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.

NOTIFICATIONS

This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
February 2019. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information  in  this  Appendix  I  as  the  only  source  of  information  relating  to  the  consequences  of  your  participation  in  the  Plan  because  the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in or exercise this Option or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.

In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.

Finally,  if  you  are  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  are  currently  working,  transfer  employment  and/or
residency after this Option is granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.

Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:

If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of this Option be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement
(or other Service contract). The terms and conditions of this Option will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and
the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to this Option.

Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement:

For purposes of the Option, your employment or Service relationship will be considered terminated as of the date you are no longer actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, (i) your right to vest in
the Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service
would  not  include  any  contractual  notice  period  or  any  period  of  “garden  leave”  or  similar  period  mandated  under  employment  laws  in  the
jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); and (ii) the period (if any) during which you may
exercise the Option after such termination of your employment or Service relationship will commence as of such date and will not be extended
by  any  notice  period  mandated  under  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement,  if  any;  the  Committee  shall  have  the  exclusive  discretion  to  determine  when  you  are  no  longer  actively  providing  Service  for
purposes of this Option (including whether you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).

Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of this Option upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section
of the Award Agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Services and this Option will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.

Termination for Cause.
The  implications  upon  a  termination  for  Cause  as  set  forth  in  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan  shall  only  be  enforced,  to  the  extent  deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items, if any, may exceed the amount withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).

If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Depending  on  the  withholding  method,  the  Company  may  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  considering  applicable  minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a
result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:

If you are located outside the U.S., this Option may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your
death to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may this Option be Transferred to another
individual during your lifetime.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge the following with respect to this Option:

(a)    This Option and any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension

rights or compensation.

(b)        In  no  event  should  this  Option,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan,  and  the  income  and  value  of  same,  be  considered  as

(c)        The  Option,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan  and  the  income  and  value  of  same  are  not  part  of  normal  or  expected

legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.

Shares upon exercise of the Options is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if

applicable  jurisdictions  including  the  United  States  and  your  country  or  your  broker's  country,  if  different,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as

Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) "tipping" third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control and
tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.

upon  exercise  of  this  Option,  to  the  extent  the  Company  determines  it  is  necessary  or  advisable  for  legal  or  administrative  reasons,  and  to
require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company or breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian  residents  are  required  to  report  any  specified  foreign  property  (including  Shares  and  Options)  on  form  T1135  (Foreign  Income

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Italian residents who, during the fiscal year, hold investments abroad or foreign financial assets (e.g.,  cash,  Shares  and  Options)  which  may
generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no
tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or foreign
financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and Options), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering provisions.

Tax on Foreign Financial Assets.
Italian residents may be subject to tax on the value of financial assets held outside of Italy. The taxable amount will be the fair market value of
the financial assets (including Shares) assessed at the end of the calendar year. If you are subject to this foreign financial assets tax, you will
need  to  report  the  value  of  your  financial  assets  held  abroad  in  your  annual  tax  return.  You  are  encouraged  to  consult  your  personal  legal
advisor for additional information about the foreign financial assets tax.

JAPAN

due  by  March  15th  each  year.  You  should  consult  with  your  personal  tax  advisor  as  to  whether  the  reporting  obligation  applies  to  you  and
whether you will be required to include details of any outstanding Shares, Options or cash held by you in the report.

Securities Law Information.

WARNING - You are being offered Options (which, upon exercise in accordance with the terms of the grant of the Options, will be converted
into Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares
are quoted on the Nasdaq. This means you may be able to sell them on the Nasdaq if there are interested buyers. You may get less than you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.

If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.

New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme.  As  a  result,  you  may  not  be  given  all  the  information  usually  required.  You  will  also  have  fewer  other  legal  protections  for  this
investment.

In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company’s latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor’s report on said financial statements (if any).

Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

years, as measured from the end of the year in which such transaction occurred.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Polish residents holding foreign securities (e.g., Shares) and/or maintaining accounts abroad must report information to the National Bank of
Poland  on  transactions  and  balances  of  the  securities  and  cash  deposited  in  such  accounts  if  the  value  of  such  securities  and  cash  (when

and that the Award Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.
You are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the Options or administration of the Plan. This Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described  in  any  Plan-related  documents  may  not  be  used  for  offering  or  public  circulation  in  Russia.  In  no  event  will  Shares  issued  upon
exercise of the Option be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.

Exchange Control Information.

You are responsible for complying with any applicable Russian exchange control regulations and rulings. Because Russian exchange control
regulations and rulings change frequently and without notice, you should consult with a legal advisor to ensure compliance applicable to any
aspect of your participation in the Plan, including the grant, vesting and exercise of the Options, issuance of any Shares at exercise, receipt of
any proceeds from the sale of Shares and/or receipt of any payments in connection with any Dividend Equivalents or dividends.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.

Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption  laws  prohibit  certain  public  servants,  their  spouses  and  their  dependent  children  from  owning  any  foreign  source  financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by these
laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

subsequently offered to another party. You should note that this Option is subject to section 257 of the SFA and you should not make (i) any

(other than section 280) of the SFA.

Chief Executive Officer / Director Notification Requirement.
If you are the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), a director, associate director or shadow director of the Company’s Singapore Subsidiary or

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section
of this Appendix I:

By accepting the grant of the Options, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant Options under the Plan to individuals who
may be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon
the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an
ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the Options are granted on the assumption and condition that
the  Options  or  the  Shares  acquired  upon  exercise  shall  not  become  a  part  of  any  employment  contract  with  the  Company  and  any  of  its
Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance

compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and
conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of
the conditions not be met for any reason, then the Options shall be null and void.

You  understand  and  agree  that,  unless  otherwise  provided  in  the  Award  Agreement,  the  vesting  and  settlement  of  the  Options  is  expressly
conditioned  on  your  continuous  Service  such  that  if  your  employment  or  rendering  of  Services  terminates  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  your
Options will cease vesting immediately effective as of the date of such termination for any reason including, but not limited to, resignation,
disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a "despido
improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause, material
modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute, and/or
Article  50  of  the  Workers'  Statute,  unilateral  withdrawal  by  your  employer  and  under  Article  10.3  of  the  Royal  Decree  1382/1985.
Consequently, upon termination for any of the above reasons, you will automatically lose any rights to the Options granted to you that were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
The Options and the Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Options do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No "offer of
securities to the public," as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has not
been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones  (the  "DGCI")  of  the  Ministerio  de  Economia  for  statistical  purposes.  This  declaration  must  be  made  in  January  for  any  Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.

You  also  are  required  to  declare  electronically  to  the  Bank  of  Spain  any  foreign  accounts  (including  brokerage  accounts  held  abroad),  any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.

To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with
a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on your
tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent
years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously reported rights or
assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.

You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

this Appendix I:

Without limitation to the Taxes section of the Award Agreement and the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this Appendix I,
you agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the
Company or your employer or by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).
You also agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and your employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay

foregoing provision will not apply. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and income tax due is not collected from or paid by
you by within ninety (90) days of the U.K. tax year in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above occurs, the amount of
any uncollected tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable. You
acknowledge that you ultimately will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC
under  the  self-assessment  regime  and  for  reimbursing  the  Company  or  the  Employer  (as  applicable)  for  the  value  of  any  employee  national
insurance contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or the Employer may recover from you by any of the means

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY

OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

FORM OF MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

Exhibit 10.16

Unless  defined  in  this  award  agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices  attached  thereto,  this  "Award  Agreement"),
capitalized  terms  will  have  the  same  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  The  Kraft  Heinz  Company  2016  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan  (as  may  be
amended from time to time, the "Plan").

Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs") as
of the Grant Date set forth below (the "Grant Date"). The RSUs are granted in connection with your purchase of Shares in the Company's
2018 Bonus Swap Program (the "Related Shares"). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of The
Kraft  Heinz  Company's  (the  "Company")  common  stock  on  the  following  terms  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Plan,  which  is
incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of the
Plan will govern.

Grant Date:

Vesting Date:

By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this
Award  Agreement  (including,  without  limitation,  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  on  Exhibit  A,  the  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement
attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY

EXHIBIT A

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE

MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Vesting

The RSUs will vest on the "Vesting Date" set forth in this Award Agreement provided that you remain employed by the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled
"Termination"),  and  subject  to  forfeiture  as  set  forth  in  the  section  below  titled  "Forfeiture  of  Unvested  RSUs  upon  the  Transfer  of  Related
Shares." Prior to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs, you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares
subject thereto.

Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below
titled "Settlement of Vested RSUs." However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs unless (i) you have complied
with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs and the delivery of such Shares complies with
applicable law and (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items (as defined below) has been received by the
Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable. Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry
on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.

Dividend Equivalents

If  while  the  RSUs  are  outstanding  the  Board  declares  a  cash  dividend  on  the  Company's  common  stock,  you  will  be  entitled  to
Dividend Equivalents on the dividend payment date established by the Company equal to the cash dividends payable on the same number of
Shares as the number of unvested RSUs subject to this award on the dividend record date established by the Company. Any  such  Dividend
Equivalents will be in the form of additional RSUs, will be subject to the same terms and vesting dates as the underlying RSUs, and will be
delivered at the same time and in the same manner as the underlying RSUs originally subject to this award. The number of additional RSUs
credited  as  Dividend  Equivalents  on  the  dividend  payment  date  will  be  determined  by  dividing  (i)  the  product  of  (A)  the  number  of  your
unvested RSUs as of the corresponding dividend record date (including any unvested Restricted Stock Units previously credited as a result of
prior  payments  of  Dividend  Equivalents)  and  (B)  the  per-Share  cash  dividend  paid  on  the  dividend  payment  date,  by  (ii)  the  per-share  Fair
Market Value of the Shares on the dividend payment date, rounded down to the nearest whole RSU.

Termination

Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting

Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,

including any accrued Dividend Equivalents, without any consideration due to you.

If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the two year anniversary of the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without
Cause (as defined below), as of the date of your termination of Service, your RSUs (plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to
such RSUs) shall be vested as if 20% of the RSUs had previously vested on each annual anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were
providing Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the two year anniversary of the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of
your  death,  Retirement  or  Disability  (as  defined  below),  as  of  the  date  of  your  termination  of  Service,  your  RSUs  (plus  any  Dividend
Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs) shall be fully vested.

Settlement of Vested RSUs

To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,
as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such
delivery  of  Shares  will  occur  within  the  settlement  period  set  forth  in  the  table  below,  which  will  vary  depending  on  the  applicable  vesting
event.

Vesting Event

Settlement Period

Vesting Date

As soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following
the Vesting Date

Termination of Service Without Cause

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Retirement

Disability

Death

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Within 60 days of the date of death

*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation as determined by
the  Company  ("Deferred  Compensation"),  settlement  will  occur  within  this  period  only  if  your  termination  of  Service  constitutes  a
"separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Separation from Service"); otherwise, settlement will occur
in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  you  are  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  and  the  Company  determines  that  you  are  a  "specified
employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are subject to settlement upon your Separation from Service will
instead be settled on the date that is the first business day following the six (6) month anniversary of such Separation from Service, or, if earlier,
upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

For purposes of this Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

"Disability" means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering  you  or  (ii)  in  the  absence  of  any  such  policy,  a  physical  or  mental  condition  rendering  you  unable  to  perform  your  duties  for  the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment  Agreement  at  the  time  of  termination  of  your  Service  and  such  Employment  Agreement  contains  a  different  definition  of
"disability" (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.

"Retirement" means a termination of Service by you on or following the earlier to occur between (a) (i) your 60th birthday and (ii)
your completion of five (5) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates, and (b) (i) your 55th birthday and (ii) your
completion of ten (10) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.

"Without Cause" means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines "Good
Reason",  then  "Without  Cause"  shall  also  include  resignation  of  your  Service  for  "Good  Reason"  in  accordance  with  such  Employment
Agreement.

Special Termination Provisions

In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on

the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

If  you  are  terminated  Without  Cause  or  due  to  your  resignation  and,  within  the  twelve  (12)  month  period  subsequent  to  such
termination  of  your  Service,  the  Company  determines  that  your  Service  could  have  been  terminated  for  Cause,  subject  to  anything  to  the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).

Effect of a Company Sale

The treatment of the RSUs upon a Company Sale shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the RSUs
constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement of any portion of the RSUs that may vest in connection with a Company Sale will occur within
sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect
of a Company Sale on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

Restrictive Covenants

Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in  partial  consideration  of  the  RSUs  granted  under  this  Award  Agreement,  you  agree  to  comply  with  the  Company's  Restrictive  Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.

Forfeiture of Unvested RSUs upon the Transfer of Related Shares

Transfer  (other  than  pursuant  to  the  laws  of  descent)  of  the  Related  Shares  before  the  RSUs  vest  (whether  on  the  Vesting  Date  or  such
earlier date set forth in the section above titled "Termination" or elsewhere in the Award Agreement), will result in immediate forfeiture of all
or a portion of the unvested RSUs granted under this Award Agreement as set forth below:

(i) If you Transfer more than 50% of the Related Shares, you will forfeit all unvested RSUs, including any accrued Dividend Equivalents.

(ii) If you Transfer 50% or less of the Related Shares (the "Transferred Percentage"),  you  will  forfeit  a  portion  of  the  unvested  RSUs

equal to twice the Transferred Percentage, plus any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to such RSUs.

Taxes

You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security or insurance,
payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-
Related  Items  legally  due  by  you  is  and  remains  your  responsibility  and  that  the  Company  and/or  its  Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  (i)  make  no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSU grant, including the
grant, vesting or settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or
Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability
for Tax-Related Items.

Prior  to  vesting  of  the  RSUs,  you  will  pay  or  make  adequate  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  Committee  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or

Affiliates or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and
absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (B) withhold
the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount, or  to  the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  accounting  principles,
withhold Shares based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable withholding rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you  are  subject  to  the
short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant tax
withholding  event,  unless  the  use  of  such  withholding  method  is  prevented  by  applicable  law  or  has  materially  adverse  accounting  or  tax
consequences, in which case, the Tax-Related Items obligation may be satisfied by one or a combination of the other methods set forth above.

Further,  the  Company  may  cause  the  RSUs  to  vest  prior  to  the  Vesting  Date  to  the  extent  necessary  to  satisfy  any  liability  for  Tax-
Related Items that arises prior to settlement of the RSUs by means of method (A) or (B) above, provided that to avoid a prohibited acceleration
under  Section  409A  of  the  Code  for  any  RSUs  that  constitute  Deferred  Compensation,  the  number  of  RSUs  so  vested  will  not  exceed  the
number necessary to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items.

Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  may  be  required  to  withhold  as  a  result  of  your  participation  in  the  Plan  that  cannot  be  satisfied  by  the  means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.

No Guarantee of Continued Service

You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above titled
"Termination") is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You further
acknowledge  and  agree  that  this  Award  Agreement,  the  transactions  contemplated  hereunder  and  the  Vesting  Date  shall  not  be  construed  as
giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company
or  the  applicable  Subsidiary  may  at  any  time  dismiss  you,  free  from  any  liability,  or  any  claim  under  the  Plan,  unless  otherwise  expressly
provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any
rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.

Company's Right of Offset

If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award

In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:

(a)    the  Plan  is  established  voluntarily  by  the  Company,  it  is  discretionary  in  nature  and  may  be  modified,  amended,  suspended  or

terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;

(b)    the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to

receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;

(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the

form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;

(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(e)    the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the

Company or its Subsidiaries;

(f)    the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or  salary  for  purposes  of  calculating  any  severance,  resignation,  termination,  redundancy,  end  of  service  payments,  bonuses,  long-service
awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;

(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(h)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of

same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;

(i)    no  claim  or  entitlement  to  compensation  or  damages  shall  arise  from  forfeiture  of  the  RSU  resulting  from  termination  of  your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise
not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if
any,  to  bring  any  such  claim,  and  release  the  Company,  and  its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  from  any  such  claim;  if,  notwithstanding  the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and

(j)        the  RSUs  are  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  certain  provisions  regarding  Adjustments,

Repurchases and Transfers).

Securities Laws

By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company's policies regarding
trading  in  its  securities  may  limit  or  restrict  your  right  to  buy  or  sell  Shares,  including,  without  limitation,  sales  of  Shares  acquired  in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.

Data Privacy

You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal
data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates or any third party
administrator as designated by the Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

You understand that the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and/or any other third party administrator as designated by the
Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or social security number or other
identification  number,  salary,  nationality,  job  title,  any  shares  of  stock  or  directorships  held  in  the  Company,  details  of  the  RSUs  or  any
other  entitlement  to  Shares  or  equivalent  benefits  awarded,  canceled,  vested,  unvested  or  outstanding  in  your  favor  ("Data"),  for  the
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting
in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country, or elsewhere, and
that  the  recipient's  country  may  have  different  data  privacy  laws  and  protections  than  your  country.  You  understand  that  if  you  reside
outside the United States,

you  may  request  a  list  with  the  names  and  addresses  of  any  potential  recipients  of  the  Data  by  contacting  your  local  human  resources
representative.  You  authorize  the  recipients  to  receive,  possess,  use,  retain  and  transfer  the  Data,  in  electronic  or  other  form,  for  the
purposes  of  implementing,  administering  and  managing  your  participation  in  the  Plan,  including  any  requisite  transfer  of  such  Data  as
may  be  required  to  a  broker,  escrow  agent  or  other  third  party  with  whom  the  Shares  received  upon  settlement  of  the  RSUs  may  be
deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the
Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage
and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by
contacting  in  writing  your  local  human  resources  representative.  You  understand  that  refusal  or  withdrawal  of  consent  may  affect  your
ability to participate in the Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be affected; the only consequence of
refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other Awards or administer or maintain
such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may
contact your local human resources representative.

Upon  request  of  the  Company  or  your  employer,  you  agree  to  provide  an  executed  data  privacy  consent  form  (or  any  other
agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or your employer) that the Company and/or your employer may deem
necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in
your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will be unable to
participate in the Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or the your employer.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries

The RSUs shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except  as  otherwise  determined  by  the  Committee,  and  to  any  additional  terms  and  conditions  deemed  necessary  or  appropriate  by  the
Committee.

No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the  written  agreement  of  the  Transferee  to  comply  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Award  Agreement,  to  the  extent  applicable,  as
determined by the Company.

Repayment/Forfeiture

As  an  additional  condition  of  receiving  the  RSUs  and  without  prejudice  to  the  terms  of  the  Company's  Restrictive  Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture  and/or  repayment  to  the  Company  to  the  extent  required  (i)  under  the  terms  of  any  policy  adopted  by  the  Company  as  may  be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply  with  any  requirements  imposed  under  applicable  laws  and/or  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  securities  exchange  or  inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company.

Section 409A

It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
("Section 409A") and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and operated to reflect this intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award Agreement and the Plan may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to the extent that is necessary or desirable to
exempt the RSUs from Section 409A or satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A, but the Company shall not be under any obligation
to  make  any  such  amendment.  Further,  the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  do  not  make  any  representation  to  you  that  the  RSUs
awarded  pursuant  to  this  Award  Agreement  shall  be  exempt  from  or  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Section  409A,  and  the  Company,  its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party  for  any  tax,  additional  tax,  interest  or  penalties  that  you  or  any  Beneficiary,  Transferee  or  other  party  may  incur  in  the  event  that  any
provision  of  this  Award  Agreement,  or  any  amendment  or  modification  thereof  or  any  other  action  taken  with  respect  thereto,  is  deemed  to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.

Entire Agreement; Modification

The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,

without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any  litigation  based  on,  arising  out  of,  under  or  in  connection  with  this  Award  Agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.

Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance

The  Company  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  decide  to  deliver  any  documents  related  to  current  or  future  participation  in  the  Plan,
including  this  Award  Agreement,  by  electronic  means  or  request  your  consent  to  participate  in  the  Plan  by  electronic  means.  You  hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established
and  maintained  by  the  Company  or  a  third  party  designated  by  the  Company.  The  Award  Agreement  if  delivered  by  electronic  means  with
electronic signatures shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.

Agreement Severable

This  Award  Agreement  shall  be  enforceable  to  the  fullest  extent  allowed  by  law.  In  the  event  that  any  provision  of  this  Award
Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, then that
provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination to the degree necessary to render it
valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Award Agreement or the validity,
legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed severable from the remainder of this Award Agreement,

and the remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent the intent
and purposes of this Award Agreement.

Interpretation

The  Committee  shall  have  the  right  to  resolve  all  questions  that  may  arise  in  connection  with  the  Award  or  this  Award  Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the
Plan or this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive. This Award Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor or successors of the Company and any person or persons who shall acquire any rights hereunder in accordance with this Award
Agreement or the Plan.

Language

If you have received this Award Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and

if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.

Acknowledgments

By signing this Award Agreement, you acknowledge receipt of a copy of the Plan and represent that you are familiar with the terms and
conditions of the Plan, and hereby accept the RSUs subject to all provisions in this Award Agreement and in the Plan. You hereby agree to

Award Agreement.

Appendix I

Notwithstanding  any  provision  in  this  Award  Agreement,  if  you  work  or  reside  outside  the  U.S.,  the  RSUs  shall  be  subject  to  the
general non-U.S. terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for your country set forth in Appendix I. Moreover, if you relocate
from  the  U.S.  to  one  of  the  countries  included  in  Appendix  I  or  you  move  between  countries  included  in  Appendix  I,  the  general  non-U.S.
terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the

Award Agreement.

EXHIBIT B

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT

I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its  Affiliates  (collectively  the  "Company"),  and  will  learn  and  have  access  to  the  Company's  confidential,  trade  secret  and  proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me RSUs or other equity grants unless I made such
promises.

In  addition  to  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  I  am  expressly  being  given  RSUs  or  other  equity  grants  in  exchange  for  my

agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential  Information.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Confidential  Information"  means  all  data,  information,  ideas,  concepts,
discoveries, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not

patentable  or  reduced  to  practice),  innovations,  improvements,  know-how,  developments,  techniques,  methods,  processes,  treatments,
drawings,  sketches,  specifications,  designs,  plans,  patterns,  models,  plans  and  strategies,  and  all  other  confidential  or  proprietary
information or trade secrets in any form or medium (whether merely remembered or embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium)
whether  now  or  hereafter  existing,  relating  to  or  arising  from  the  past,  current  or  potential  business,  activities  and/or  operations  of  the
Company, including, without limitation, any such information relating to or concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition,
promotions,  pricing,  personnel,  customers,  suppliers,  vendors,  raw  partners  and/or  competitors  of  the  Company.  Executive  agrees  that
Executive  shall  not,  directly  or  indirectly,  use,  make  available,  sell,  disclose  or  otherwise  communicate  to  any  person,  other  than  in  the
course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either during the period of Executive's Service or at any time
thereafter, any Confidential Information or other confidential or proprietary information received from third parties subject to a duty on the
Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to use such information only for certain limited purposes, in each
case, which shall have been obtained by Executive during Executive's Service. The foregoing shall not apply to information that (i) was
known to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive
through  no  wrongful  act  of  Executive  or  any  representative  of  Executive;  or  (iii)  Executive  is  required  to  disclose  by  applicable  law,
regulation  or  legal  process  (provided  that,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  Executive  provides  the  Company  with  prior  notice  of  the
contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of
such information).

Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade  secret  law  for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  is  made  in  confidence  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade  secrets  in  a  complaint,  or  other  document,  filed  in  a  lawsuit,  or  other  proceeding,  if  such  filing  is  made  under  seal.  Finally,  if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

No  Company  policies  or  practices,  including  this  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  provision,  is  intended  to  or  shall  limit,
prevent,  impede  or  interfere  in  any  way  with  Executive's  right,  without  prior  notice  to  the  Company,  to  provide  information  to  the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.

2. NON-COMPETITION.  Executive  acknowledges  that  (i)  Executive  performs  services  of  a  unique  nature  for  the  Company  that  are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive  has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  Confidential  Information  which,  if  disclosed,  would  unfairly  and  inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  these  customers,  (v)  Executive  has  received  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted Period"), Executive will not engage in any business activities, directly or indirectly (whether as an employee, consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert
with  others,  or  in  any  other  manner)  within  the  same  line  or  lines  of  business  for  which  the  Executive  performed  services  for  the
Company and in a capacity that is similar to the capacity in which

the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with the Company in the consumer packaged food
and beverage industry ("Competitive Business") anywhere within the same geographic territory(ies) for which the Executive performed
services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being
a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in
competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.

3. NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.

4. NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render  services  to  or  with  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  unaffiliated  with  the  Company  or  hire  or  retain  any  such
employee,  representative  or  agent,  or  take  any  action  to  materially  assist  or  aid  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce"  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  (i)  initiating  communications  with  a  Company  employee  relating  to  possible  employment,  (ii)
offering  bonuses  or  other  compensation  to  encourage  a  Company  employee  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  with  the  Company  and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.

5. NON-DISPARAGEMENT.  Executive  agrees  not  to  make  negative  comments  or  otherwise  disparage  the  Company  or  its  officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response  to  legal  process,  required  governmental  testimony  or  filings,  or  administrative  or  arbitral  proceedings  (including,  without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.

6.

INVENTIONS.

a. Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software,  know-how,  processes,  techniques,  methods,  works  of  authorship  and  other  work  product  ("Inventions"),  whether
patentable  or  unpatentable,  (A)  that  are  reduced  to  practice,  created,  invented,  designed,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  improved
with  the  use  of  any  Company  resources  and/or  within  the  scope  of  Executive's  work  with  the  Company  or  that  relate  to  the
business,  operations  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company,  and  that  are  made  or
conceived by Executive, solely or jointly with others, during Executive's Service, or (B) suggested by any

work that Executive performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on
Executive's own time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to
the Company, shall belong exclusively to the Company (or its designee), whether or not patent or other applications for intellectual
property  protection  are  filed  thereon.  Executive  will  keep  full  and  complete  written  records  (the  "Records"),  in  the  manner
prescribed by the Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company.
The Records shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of
Service, or upon the Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and
all  patents  or  other  intellectual  property  rights  that  may  issue  thereon  in  any  and  all  countries,  whether  during  or  subsequent  to
Executive's  Service,  together  with  the  right  to  file,  in  Executive's  name  or  in  the  name  of  the  Company  (or  its  designee),
applications  for  patents  and  equivalent  rights  (the  "Applications").  Executive  will,  at  any  time  during  and  subsequent  to
Executive's  Service,  make  such  applications,  sign  such  papers,  take  all  rightful  oaths,  and  perform  all  other  acts  as  may  be
requested  from  time  to  time  by  the  Company  to  perfect,  record,  enforce,  protect,  patent  or  register  the  Company's  rights  in  the
Inventions, all without additional compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the
Company  (or  its  designee)  of  the  Applications,  and  give  the  Company  and  its  attorneys  all  reasonable  assistance  (including  the
giving of testimony) to obtain the Inventions for the Company's benefit, all without additional compensation to Executive from the
Company, but entirely at the Company's expense.

b.

In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise  automatically  vest  in  the  Company,  Executive  hereby  irrevocably  conveys,  transfers  and  assigns  to  the  Company,  all
rights,  in  all  media  now  known  or  hereinafter  devised,  throughout  the  universe  and  in  perpetuity,  in  and  to  the  Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To  the  extent  that  Executive  has  any  rights  in  the  results  and  proceeds  of  Executive's  service  to  the  Company  that  cannot  be
assigned  in  the  manner  described  herein,  Executive  agrees  to  unconditionally  waive  the  enforcement  of  such  rights.  Executive
hereby  waives  any  and  all  currently  existing  and  future  monetary  rights  in  and  to  the  Inventions  and  all  patents  and  other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.

7. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).

8. REASONABLENESS  OF  COVENANTS.  In  signing  this  Agreement,  including  by  electronic  means,  Executive  gives  the  Company
assurance  that  Executive  has  carefully  read  and  considered  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  restraints
imposed  by  it.  Executive  agrees  that  these  restraints  are  necessary  for  the  reasonable  and  proper  protection  of  the  Company  and  its
Confidential Information and that each and every one of

the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area, and that these restraints, individually or in the
aggregate,  will  not  prevent  Executive  from  obtaining  other  suitable  employment  during  the  period  in  which  Executive  is  bound  by  the
restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and
that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that
Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and that Executive
will reimburse the Company for all costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the
reasonableness  or  enforceability  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement.  It  is  also  agreed  that  the  "Company"  as  used  in  this
Agreement refers to each of the Company's Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates
will  have  the  right  to  enforce  all  of  Executive's  obligations  to  that  Subsidiary  or  Affiliate  under  this  Agreement,  as  applicable,
subject to any limitation or restriction on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.

9. REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.

10. REMEDIES.  Executive  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company's  remedies  at  law  for  a  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  any  of  the
provisions  of  Agreement  would  be  inadequate  and,  in  recognition  of  this  fact,  Executive  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable  relief  in  the  form  of  specific  performance,  a  temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction  or  any  other
equitable  remedy  which  may  then  be  available,  without  the  necessity  of  showing  actual  monetary  damages,  in  addition  to  any  other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.

11. REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's RSU and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

12. TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

13. SURVIVAL  OF  PROVISIONS.  The  obligations  contained  in  this  Agreement hereof  shall  survive  the  termination  or  expiration  of  the

Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.

14. VENUE,  PERSONAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  COVENANT  NOT  TO  SUE.  Executive  expressly  agrees  to  submit  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect  to  a  dispute  between  the  Company  and  Executive  in  relation  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement,  regardless  of  where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have  any  disputes  between  the  Company  and  Executive  related  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement  decided  in  any  jurisdiction  or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying

of  venue  of  any  such  suit,  action  or  proceeding,  and  Executive  agrees  not  to  plead  or  claim  the  same.  Executive  further  irrevocably
covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the
State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation, construction, application, validity, and enforcement of this Agreement, and any
disputes or controversies arising hereunder, will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

APPENDIX I

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

MATCHING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the
U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These  terms  and  conditions  are  in  addition  to,  or  if  so  indicated,  in  place  of  the  terms  and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another  country  after  the  RSUs  are  granted  to  you,  or  are  considered  a  resident  of  another  country  for  local  law  purposes,  the  terms  and
conditions  contained  herein  may  not  be  applicable  to  you,  and  the  Company  shall,  in  its  discretion,  determine  to  what  extent  the  terms  and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.

NOTIFICATIONS

This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
January 2018. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information  in  this  Appendix  I  as  the  only  source  of  information  relating  to  the  consequences  of  your  participation  in  the  Plan  because  the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.

In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.

Finally,  if  you  are  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  are  currently  working,  transfer  employment  and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.

Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:

If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
Award  Agreement,  including  this  Appendix  I,  which  supersede  and  replace  any  prior  agreement,  either  written  or  verbal  (including  your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.

Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  to  obtain  the  approval  of  any  governmental  or  regulatory  body  in  your  country  of  residence  (or  your  country  of  employment,  if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).

Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the  Award  Agreement  titled  "Settlement  of  Vested  RSUs,"  if  you  are  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  and  the  RSUs  constitute  Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:

For  purposes  of  the  RSU,  your  employment  or  Service  relationship  will  be  considered  terminated  as  of  the  date  you  are  no  longer  actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment  Agreement,  if  any);  the  Committee  shall  have  the  exclusive  discretion  to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).

Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section of
the  Award  Agreement,  if  the  Company  receives  an  opinion  of  counsel  that  there  has  been  a  legal  judgment  and/or  legal  development  in  a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.

Termination for Cause.
The  implications  upon  a  termination  for  Cause  as  set  forth  in  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan  shall  only  be  enforced,  to  the  extent  deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).

If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Depending  on  the  withholding  method,  the  Company  may  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  considering  applicable  minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result
of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:

If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your death
to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another individual
during your lifetime.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:

(a)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights

or compensation.

(b)        In  no  event  should  the  RSUs,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan,  and  the  income  and  value  of  same,  be  considered  as

compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.

(c)    The RSU, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation

or salary for any purpose.

(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.

Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different).  The  Company  has  not  submitted  any  registration  statement,  prospectus  or  other  filings  to  the  local  securities  authorities  in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.

Language Consent.
If  you  are  resident  or  employed  outside  of  the  United  States,  you  acknowledge  and  agree  that  it  is  your  express  intent  that  this  Award
Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up
in English.

Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You  may  be  subject  to  insider  trading  restrictions  and/or  market  abuse  laws  based  on  the  exchange  on  which  the  Shares  are  listed  and  in
applicable  jurisdictions  including  the  United  States  and  your  country  or  your  broker's  country,  if  different,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as
you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading  laws  and  regulations  may  prohibit  the  cancellation  or  amendment  of  orders  you  placed  before  you  possessed  inside  information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) "tipping" third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer  of  Shares  or  cash  (including  dividends,  dividend  equivalents  and  the  proceeds  arising  from  the  sale  of  Shares)  derived  from  your
participation  in  the  Plan,  to  and/or  from  a  brokerage/bank  account  or  legal  entity  located  outside  your  country.  The  applicable  laws  of  your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable  authorities  in  such  country.  You  acknowledge  that  you  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  any  applicable  foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.

No Advice Regarding Award.
The  Company  is  not  providing  any  tax,  legal  or  financial  advice,  nor  is  the  Company  making  any  recommendations  regarding  your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and acknowledge that you should consult with
your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired upon
vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to
sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company for breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

This offer document sets out information regarding the grant of RSUs to Australian resident employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  and  is  provided  by  the  Company  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  Plan  with  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission's
("ASIC's") Class Order 14/1000 and relevant provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.

In addition to the information set out in the Award Agreement, you also are being provided with copies of the following documents:

(a)

the Plan;

(b)

the Bonus Election Form; and

(c)

the Bonus Election Form FAQs

(collectively, the "Additional Documents").

The Additional Documents provide further information to help you make an informed investment decision about participating in the Plan. The
Plan is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.

You should not rely upon any oral statements made in relation to this offer. You should rely only upon the statements contained in the Award
Agreement and the Additional Documents when considering participation in the Plan.

Securities Law Notification
Investment in Shares involves a degree of risk. If you elect to participate in the Plan, you should monitor your participation and consider all risk
factors relevant to the acquisition of Shares under the Plan as set out in the Award Agreement and the Additional Documents.

The  information  contained  in  this  offer  is  general  information  only.  It  is  not  advice  or  information  that  takes  into  account  your  objectives,
financial situation and needs.

You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Plan.

Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business
risks.

More  information  about  potential  factors  that  could  affect  the  Company's  business  and  financial  results  is  included  in  the  Company's  most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Copies

of these reports are available at http://www.sec.gov/, on the Company's "Investor Relations" page at http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/, and upon
request to the Company.

In addition, you should be aware that the Australian dollar value of any Shares acquired at vesting will be affected by the U.S. dollar/Australian
dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.

Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.

Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.

The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."

The  Shares  are  not  liable  to  any  further  calls  for  payment  of  capital  or  for  other  assessment  by  the  Company  and  have  no  sinking  fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.

Ascertaining the Market Price of Shares
You may ascertain the current market price of the Shares as traded on the Nasdaq at http://www.Nasdaq.com under the symbol "KHC." The
Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.

This will not be a prediction of what the market price per Share will be when the RSUs vest or when the Shares are issued or of the applicable
exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.

Deferred Taxation.
Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act, 1997, applies to RSUs granted under the Plan, such that the RSUs are intended to be
subject to deferred taxation.

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of the
Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian  residents  are  required  to  report  any  specified  foreign  property  (including  Shares  and  RSUs)  on  form  T1135  (Foreign  Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs must
be  reported  -  generally  at  a  nil  cost  -  if  the  C$100,000  cost  threshold  is  exceeded  because  of  other  foreign  property  you  hold.  If  Shares  are
acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB")  of  the  Shares.  The  ACB  would  normally  equal  the  fair  market  value  of  the
Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a
personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

CHINA

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The  following  provisions  apply  if  you  are  subject  to  the  exchange  control  regulations  or  restrictions  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China
("China"), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:

Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Vesting, Termination and Settlement of Vested RSUs sections of the Award Agreement:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force the
sale  of  any  Shares  (i)  immediately  upon  vesting,  (ii)  following  the  termination  of  your  Service,  (iii)  following  your  transfer  to  another
Subsidiary or Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree
that you must maintain any Shares acquired under the Plan in an account at a broker designated by the Company ("Designated Account"). All
Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the termination
of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all Shares acquired
under the Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the expiration of this
six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).

You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant  to  this  authorization)  and  you  expressly  authorize  the  Company's  designated  broker  to  complete  the  sale  of  such  Shares.  You
acknowledge that the Company's designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any
obligation  to  satisfy  Tax-Related  Items.  You  agree  that  if  you  sell  Shares  that  you  acquire  under  the  Plan,  the  repatriation  requirements
described below shall apply.

If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of China,
you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The
Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or advisable to comply
with local regulations.

Exchange Control Restriction.

You  understand  and  agree  that,  due  to  exchange  control  laws  in  China,  you  will  be  required  to  immediately  repatriate  to  China  any  cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby consent
and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds from your
participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) is under
no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate, and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due to exchange control
restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your proceeds are delivered to
such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.

You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance
with exchange control requirements in China.

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted  on  the  Nasdaq.  This  means  you  may  be  able  to  sell  them  on  the  Nasdaq  if  there  are  interested  buyers.  You  may  get  less  than  you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.

If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.

New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme.  As  a  result,  you  may  not  be  given  all  the  information  usually  required.  You  will  also  have  fewer  other  legal  protections  for  this
investment.

In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).

Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

Company  or  your  employer,  you  agree  to  provide  an  executed  data  privacy  consent  form  to  your  employer  or  the  Company  (or  any  other

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the RSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described  in  any  Plan-related  documents  may  not  be  used  for  offering  or  public  circulation  in  Russia.  In  no  event  will  Shares  issued  upon
vesting of the RSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.

Exchange Control Information.
Under  current  exchange  control  regulations,  within  a  reasonably  short  time  after  sale  of  the  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan  or  receipt  of
dividends on the Shares, you must repatriate the sale proceeds or dividends to Russia. Such funds must be initially credited to you through a
foreign  currency  account  at  an  authorized  bank  in  Russia.  After  the  funds  are  initially  received  in  Russia,  they  may  be  further  remitted  to
foreign banks subject to the following limitations: (i) the foreign account may be opened only for individuals; (ii) the foreign account may not
be used for business activities; and (iii) you must give notice to the Russian tax authorities about the opening/closing of each foreign account
within one month of the account opening/closing. Cash dividends (but not dividend equivalents) and cash income received from the transfer of
funds and/or Shares into the fiduciary/trust management of a non-resident do not need to be remitted to your bank account in Russia but instead
can be remitted directly to a foreign individual bank account (in Organisation

for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") and Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") countries (such as the United States)). As
from January 1, 2018, cash proceeds from the sale of Shares listed on the Russian stock exchange or a foreign exchange on the legally approved
list, also can be paid directly to your foreign bank account opened with a bank located in an OECD or FATF country.

You  are  encouraged  to  contact  your  personal  advisor  before  remitting  your  sale  proceeds  or  any  dividends  to  Russia  as  exchange  control
requirements may change and significant penalties apply in the case of non-compliance with the exchange control requirements.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.

Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption  laws  prohibit  certain  public  servants,  their  spouses  and  their  dependent  children  from  owning  any  foreign  source  financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by these
laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

SPAIN

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the first paragraph of the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and
Conditions section of this Appendix I:

By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may
be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the
express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an
ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the RSUs are granted on the assumption and condition that the
RSUs or the Shares acquired upon vesting shall not become a part of any employment contract with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In
addition,  you  understand  that  this  grant  would  not  be  made  to  you  but  for  the  assumptions  and  conditions  referred  to  above;  thus,  you
acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason,
then the RSUs shall be null and void.

You  understand  and  agree  that,  unless  otherwise  provided  in  the  Award  Agreement,  the  vesting  and  settlement  of  the  RSUs  is  expressly
conditioned  on  your  continuous  Service  such  that  if  your  employment  or  rendering  of  Services  terminates  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  your
RSUs  will  cease  vesting  immediately  effective  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  for  any  reason  including,  but  not  limited  to,  resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a
"despido improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause,
material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute,
and/or  Article  50  of  the  Workers'  Statute,  unilateral  withdrawal  by  your  employer  and  under  Article  10.3  of  the  Royal  Decree  1382/1985.
Consequently,  upon  termination  for  any  of  the  above  reasons,  you  will  automatically  lose  any  rights  to  the  RSUs  granted  to  you  that  were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

Securities Law Information.
The  RSUs  and  the  Shares  issued  pursuant  to  the  vesting  of  the  RSUs  do  not  qualify  under  Spanish  regulations  as  securities.  No  "offer  of
securities to the public," as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has not
been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones  (the  "DGCI")  of  the  Ministerio  de  Economia  for  statistical  purposes.  This  declaration  must  be  made  in  January  for  any  Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.

You  also  are  required  to  declare  electronically  to  the  Bank  of  Spain  any  foreign  accounts  (including  brokerage  accounts  held  abroad),  any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.

To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with
a value in excess of €50,000 per type of asset as of December 31 each year, you will be required to report information on such assets on your
tax return (tax form 720) for such year. After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent
years only if the value of such right or asset increases by more than €20,000 or if you sell or otherwise dispose of previously reported rights or
assets. The reporting must be completed by the following March 31.

You are solely responsible for complying with applicable reporting obligations. The laws are often complex and can change frequently. You
should consult your personal legal and/or tax advisor to confirm the reporting requirements that will apply to you in connection with the Plan.

OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

Exhibit 10.17

Unless  defined  in  this  award  agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices  attached  thereto,  this  "Award  Agreement"),
capitalized  terms  will  have  the  same  meanings  ascribed  to  them  in  The  Kraft  Heinz  Company  2016  Omnibus  Incentive  Plan  (as  may  be
amended from time to time, the "Plan").

Subject to your acceptance of this Award Agreement, you are hereby being granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs") as
of the Grant Date set forth below (the "Grant Date"). Each RSU is a bookkeeping entry representing the right to receive one (1) share of The
Kraft  Heinz  Company's  (the  "Company")  common  stock  on  the  following  terms  and  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Plan,  which  is
incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of the
Plan will govern.

By agreeing to this Award Agreement, you agree that the RSUs are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of this

attached as Exhibit B and the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix I) and the Plan.

THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY

EXHIBIT A

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Vesting

The  RSUs  will  vest  on  the  "Vesting  Date"  set  forth  in  this  Award  Agreement  subject  to  your  continued  Service  (including,  for  the
avoidance of doubt, service as a consultant or advisor) with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Plan or
this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, the section below titled "Termination"). Prior to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs,
you will not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the RSUs or the Shares subject thereto.

Shares due to you upon vesting and settlement of the RSUs will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the section below titled
"Settlement of Vested RSUs." However, no Shares will be delivered pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs prior to the fulfillment of all of the
following conditions: (i) you have complied with your obligations under this Award Agreement and the Plan, (ii) the vesting of the RSUs and
the delivery of such Shares complies with applicable law, (iii) full payment (or satisfactory provision therefor) of any Tax-Related Items (as
defined below), (iv) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Shares are then listed, (v) the completion of any
registration or other qualification of the Shares under any state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem
necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares
would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (vi) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state,
federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (vii) the
lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the RSUs become payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for
reasons of administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect
to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the RSUs.

Termination

Effect of a Termination of Service on Vesting

Other than as set forth below, upon a termination of your Service for any reason prior to the Vesting Date, you will forfeit the RSUs,

without any consideration due to you.

If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the three year anniversary of the Grant Date, the Company terminates your Service Without
Cause (as defined below), as of the date of your termination of Service, your RSUs shall be vested as if 30% of the RSUs had previously vested
on the third anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service and 60% of the RSUs has previously vested on the fourth
anniversary of the Grant Date on which you were providing Service. If prior to the Vesting Date, but on or after the three year anniversary of
the Grant Date, your Service terminates by reason of your death, Retirement or Disability (as defined below), as of the date of your termination
of Service, your RSUs shall be fully vested.

Settlement of Vested RSUs

To the extent the RSUs become vested pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement, the Company will issue and deliver to you, or,

as applicable, your Beneficiary or the personal representative of your estate, the number of

Shares equal to the number of vested RSUs. Such delivery of Shares will occur within the settlement period set forth in the table below, which
will vary depending on the applicable vesting event.

Vesting Event

Settlement Period

Vesting Date

As soon as practicable and no later than 60 days following
the Vesting Date

Termination of Service Without Cause

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Retirement

Disability

Death

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Within 60 days of your termination date*

Within 60 days of the date of death

*If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the RSUs constitute an item of non-qualified deferred compensation, within the meaning
of Section 409A of the Code, as determined by the Company ("Deferred Compensation"), settlement will occur within this period only if
your termination of Service constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code ("Separation from
Service"); otherwise, settlement will occur in accordance with the original vesting schedule (i.e., as soon as practicable and no later than
sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date).

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  you  are  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  and  the  Company  determines  that  you  are  a  "specified
employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, any RSUs that are Deferred Compensation and are subject to settlement upon your
Separation  from  Service  will  instead  be  settled  on  the  date  that  is  the  first  business  day  following  the  six  (6)  month  anniversary  of  such
Separation from Service, or, if earlier, upon your death, to the extent required pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

Applicable Definitions

All  capitalized  terms  used  in  this  Agreement  without  definition  shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  in  the  Plan.  For  purposes  of  this

Award Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

"Disability" means (i) a physical or mental condition entitling you to benefits under the long-term disability policy of the Company
covering  you  or  (ii)  in  the  absence  of  any  such  policy,  a  physical  or  mental  condition  rendering  you  unable  to  perform  your  duties  for  the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of six (6) consecutive months or longer; provided that if you are a party to an
Employment  Agreement  at  the  time  of  termination  of  your  Service  and  such  Employment  Agreement  contains  a  different  definition  of
"disability" (or any derivation thereof), the definition in such Employment Agreement will control for purposes of this Award Agreement.

"Employment Agreement" means an individual written employment agreement between you and the Company or any of its Affiliates,

including an offer letter.

"Retirement" means a termination of Service by you on or following the earlier to occur between (a) (i) your 60th birthday and (ii) your
completion  of  five  (5)  years  of  Service  with  the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  or  its  Affiliates,  and  (b)  (i)  your  55th  birthday  and  (ii)  your
completion of ten (10) years of Service with the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates.

"Without Cause" means (i) a termination of your Service by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates other than for Cause (as
defined in the Plan) and other than due to your death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) (A) if you are a party to an Employment Agreement, (B)
such Employment Agreement is in effect upon the date of your termination of Service and (C) such Employment Agreement defines "Good
Reason",  then  "Without  Cause"  shall  also  include  resignation  of  your  Service  for  "Good  Reason"  in  accordance  with  such  Employment
Agreement.

Special Termination Provisions

In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the effect of a termination of your Service on

the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

If  you  are  terminated  Without  Cause  or  due  to  your  resignation  and,  within  the  twelve  (12)  month  period  subsequent  to  such
termination  of  your  Service,  the  Company  determines  that  your  Service  could  have  been  terminated  for  Cause,  subject  to  anything  to  the
contrary that may be contained in your Employment Agreement at the time of termination of your Service, your Service will, at the election of
the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award Agreement and the Plan, effective as of the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred and any consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including
your obligation to repay gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).

Effect of a Change in Control

The treatment of the RSUs upon a Change in Control shall be governed by the Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the RSUs
constitute  Deferred  Compensation,  settlement  of  any  portion  of  the  RSUs  that  may  vest  in  connection  with  a  Change  in  Control  will  occur
within sixty (60) days following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement regarding the
effect of a Change in Control on the RSUs and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Award Agreement will govern.

Restrictive Covenants

Your Service will provide you with specialized training and unique knowledge and access to confidential information and key business
relationships, which, if used in competition with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates, would cause harm to such entities. As such,
in  partial  consideration  of  the  RSUs  granted  under  this  Award  Agreement,  you  agree  to  comply  with  the  Company's  Restrictive  Covenants
Agreement, attached (and incorporated into this Award Agreement) as Exhibit B. The restrictions and obligations contained in the Restrictive
Covenants Agreement are in addition to any restrictions imposed by, or obligations you may have to, the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
under any Employment Agreement or otherwise.

Taxes

You  acknowledge  that,  regardless  of  any  action  the  Company  or  your  employer  (the  “Employer”)  takes  with  respect  to  any  or  all
income tax, social security or insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related
Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and that the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any
aspect  of  the  RSU  grant,  including  the  grant,  vesting  or  settlement  of  the  RSUs,  the  subsequent  sale  of  Shares  acquired  pursuant  to  such
settlement and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalents and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of
the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.

Prior  to  vesting  of  the  RSUs,  you  will  pay  or  make  adequate  arrangements  satisfactory  to  the  Committee  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related
Items. In this regard, you authorize the withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by you from your wages or other cash
compensation  paid  to  you  by  the  Company  and/or  its  Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  or  from  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  Shares.  Alternatively,  or  in
addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (A) sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that you
acquire to meet the obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (B) withhold the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding
amount,  or  to  the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  accounting  principles,  withhold  Shares  based  on  a  rate  of  up  to  the  maximum  applicable
withholding rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, you may elect the
form of withholding in advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of your election, the Company shall deduct the
number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the vesting of the RSUs, or the
Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.

Further, the Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or
payment of the RSUs or sale of Shares issued in settlement of the RSUs, as the case may be, by deducting the number of Shares having an
aggregate  value  equal  to  the  amount  of  the  Tax-Related  Items  withholding  due  or  otherwise  becoming  subject  to  current  taxation.  If  the
Company  satisfies  the  Tax-Related  Items  obligation  by  withholding  a  number  of  Shares  as  described  herein,  for  tax  purposes,  you  shall  be
deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the
purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.

Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be,
by withholding from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer.

Finally, you will pay to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or its
Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  may  be  required  to  withhold  as  a  result  of  your  participation  in  the  Plan  that  cannot  be  satisfied  by  the  means
previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver the Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-
Related Items as described in this section.

No Guarantee of Continued Service

You acknowledge and agree that the vesting of the RSUs on the Vesting Date (or such earlier date as set forth in the section above titled
"Termination") is earned only by performing continuing Service (not through the act of being hired or being granted this Award). You further
acknowledge  and  agree  that  this  Award  Agreement,  the  transactions  contemplated  hereunder  and  the  Vesting  Date  shall  not  be  construed  as
giving you the right to be retained in the employ of, or to continue to provide Service to, the Company or its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company
or  the  applicable  Subsidiary  may  at  any  time  dismiss  you,  free  from  any  liability,  or  any  claim  under  the  Plan,  unless  otherwise  expressly
provided in any other agreement binding you, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary. The receipt of this Award is not intended to confer any
rights on you except as set forth in this Award Agreement.

Company's Right of Offset

If you become entitled to a distribution of benefits under this Award, and if at such time you have any outstanding debt, obligation, or
other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, then the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
Affiliates, upon a determination by the Committee, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and it would not cause a violation of Section
409A of the Code, may offset such amount so owing against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable. Such determination shall be made
by the Committee.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award

In accepting the RSUs, you understand, acknowledge and agree that:

(a)    the  Plan  is  established  voluntarily  by  the  Company,  it  is  discretionary  in  nature  and  may  be  modified,  amended,  suspended  or

terminated by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan and this Award Agreement;

(b)    the award of the RSUs is exceptional, voluntary, occasional and discretionary and does not create any contractual or other right to

receive future RSU awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs even if RSUs have been awarded in the past;

(c)    all decisions with respect to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the

form and timing of the RSUs, the number of Shares subject to the RSUs, and the vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs;

(d)    your participation in the Plan is voluntary;

(e)    the RSUs are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the

Company or its Subsidiaries;

(f)    the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation
or  salary  for  purposes  of  calculating  any  severance,  resignation,  termination,  redundancy,  end  of  service  payments,  bonuses,  long-service
awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;

(g)    the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(h)    unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of

same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any Service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate;

(i)    no  claim  or  entitlement  to  compensation  or  damages  shall  arise  from  forfeiture  of  the  RSU  resulting  from  termination  of  your
Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you
provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise
not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if
any,  to  bring  any  such  claim,  and  release  the  Company,  and  its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  from  any  such  claim;  if,  notwithstanding  the
foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to
have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
and

(j)        the  RSUs  are  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  certain  provisions  regarding  Adjustments,

Repurchases and Transfers).

Securities Laws

By accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge that U.S. federal, state or foreign securities laws and/or the Company's policies regarding
trading  in  its  securities  may  limit  or  restrict  your  right  to  buy  or  sell  Shares,  including,  without  limitation,  sales  of  Shares  acquired  in
connection with the RSUs. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws and policies are
amended from time to time.

Data Privacy

You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal
data as described in this Award Agreement by and among, as applicable, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates or any third party
administrator as designated by the Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

You understand that the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates and/or any other third party administrator as designated by the
Committee or its designee in its sole and absolute discretion may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to,
your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or social security number or other
identification  number,  salary,  nationality,  job  title,  any  shares  of  stock  or  directorships  held  in  the  Company,  details  of  the  RSUs  or  any
other  entitlement  to  Shares  or  equivalent  benefits  awarded,  canceled,  vested,  unvested  or  outstanding  in  your  favor  ("Data"),  for  the
purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to any third parties assisting
in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country, or elsewhere, and
that  the  recipient's  country  may  have  different  data  privacy  laws  and  protections  than  your  country.  You  understand  that  if  you  reside
outside the United States, you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your
local human resources representative. You authorize the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data,

in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any
requisite  transfer  of  such  Data  as  may  be  required  to  a  broker,  escrow  agent  or  other  third  party  with  whom  the  Shares  received  upon
settlement of the RSUs may be deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and
manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States you may, at any time, view Data, request
information  about  the  storage  and  processing  of  Data,  require  any  necessary  amendments  to  Data  or  refuse  or  withdraw  the  consents
herein,  in  any  case  without  cost,  by  contacting  in  writing  your  local  human  resources  representative.  You  understand  that  refusal  or
withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein
on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be
affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other
Awards or administer or maintain such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of
consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

Upon  request  of  the  Company  or  your  employer,  you  agree  to  provide  an  executed  data  privacy  consent  form  (or  any  other
agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or your employer) that the Company and/or your employer may deem
necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in
your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will be unable to
participate in the Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Company and/or your employer.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries

The RSUs shall not be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability to any party, or
Transferred, otherwise than by your will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a Beneficiary upon your death. A Beneficiary or other
person claiming any rights under this Award Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and this Award Agreement,
except  as  otherwise  determined  by  the  Committee,  and  to  any  additional  terms  and  conditions  deemed  necessary  or  appropriate  by  the
Committee.

No Transfer to any executor or administrator of your estate or to any Beneficiary by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any
rights in respect of the RSUs shall be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (i) written notice
thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer and (ii)
the  written  agreement  of  the  Transferee  to  comply  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Award  Agreement,  to  the  extent  applicable,  as
determined by the Company.

Repayment/Forfeiture

As  an  additional  condition  of  receiving  the  RSUs  and  without  prejudice  to  the  terms  of  the  Company's  Restrictive  Covenants
Agreement (attached as Exhibit B), you agree that the RSUs and any proceeds or other benefits you may receive hereunder shall be subject to
forfeiture  and/or  repayment  to  the  Company  to  the  extent  required  (i)  under  the  terms  of  any  policy  adopted  by  the  Company  as  may  be
amended from time to time (and such requirements shall be deemed incorporated into this Award Agreement without your consent) or (ii) to
comply  with  any  requirements  imposed  under  applicable  laws  and/or  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  securities  exchange  or  inter-dealer
quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms
of the RSUs for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error),
all as determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or about
this Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with
the  Commission,  (ii)  providing  the  Commission  with  information  that  would  otherwise  violate  the  non-disclosure  restrictions  in  this
Agreement,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Section  21F  of  the  Act;  (iii)  cooperating,  participating  or  assisting  in  a  Commission  investigation  or
proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F of the Act. Furthermore,  you  are
advised that you shall not be held

criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Confidential Information (as defined in Exhibit
B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (i) in confidence to a
federal,  state  or  local  government  official,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  or  to  an  attorney,  in  each  case,  solely  for  the  purpose  of  reporting  or
investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made
under seal.

Section 409A

It is intended that the RSUs awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code
("Section 409A") and the Award Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and operated to reflect this intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award Agreement and the Plan may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to the extent that is necessary or desirable to
exempt the RSUs from Section 409A or satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A, but the Company shall not be under any obligation
to  make  any  such  amendment.  Further,  the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  and  Affiliates  do  not  make  any  representation  to  you  that  the  RSUs
awarded  pursuant  to  this  Award  Agreement  shall  be  exempt  from  or  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Section  409A,  and  the  Company,  its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no liability or other obligation to indemnify or hold harmless you or any Beneficiary, Transferee or other
party  for  any  tax,  additional  tax,  interest  or  penalties  that  you  or  any  Beneficiary,  Transferee  or  other  party  may  incur  in  the  event  that  any
provision  of  this  Award  Agreement,  or  any  amendment  or  modification  thereof  or  any  other  action  taken  with  respect  thereto,  is  deemed  to
violate any of the requirements of Section 409A.

Entire Agreement; Modification

The Plan, this Award Agreement and, to the extent applicable, your Employment Agreement or any separation agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings, representations
and agreements (whether oral or written) of the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
This Award Agreement may not be modified in a manner that adversely affects your rights heretofore granted under the Plan, except with your
consent or to comply with applicable law or to the extent permitted under other provisions of the Plan.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

This Award Agreement (together with all exhibits and appendices attached thereto) is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,

without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and any disputes shall be settled in accordance with the Plan.

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of
any  litigation  based  on,  arising  out  of,  under  or  in  connection  with  this  Award  Agreement  (together  with  all  exhibits  and  appendices
attached thereto) or the Plan.

Electronic Signatures and Delivery and Acceptance

The  Company  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  decide  to  deliver  any  documents  related  to  current  or  future  participation  in  the  Plan,
including  this  Award  Agreement,  by  electronic  means  or  request  your  consent  to  participate  in  the  Plan  by  electronic  means.  You  hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established

binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person.

Agreement Severable

Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law

or rule in any jurisdiction, then that provision shall be reduced, modified or otherwise conformed to the relevant law, judgment or determination
to the degree necessary to render it valid and enforceable without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this
Award Agreement or the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Any provision of this Award Agreement
that  is  prohibited  or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as  to  such  jurisdiction,  be  deemed  severable  from  the  remainder  of  this  Award
Agreement, and the remaining provisions contained in this Award Agreement shall be construed to preserve to the maximum permissible extent
the intent and purposes of this Award Agreement.

Interpretation

The  Committee  shall  have  the  right  to  resolve  all  questions  that  may  arise  in  connection  with  the  Award  or  this  Award  Agreement,
including whether you are actively employed. Any interpretation, determination or other action made or taken by the Committee regarding the

Award Agreement.

EXHIBIT B

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT

I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its  Affiliates  (collectively  the  "Company"),  and  will  learn  and  have  access  to  the  Company's  confidential,  trade  secret  and  proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me RSUs or other equity grants unless I made such
promises.

In  addition  to  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  I  am  expressly  being  given  RSUs  or  other  equity  grants  in  exchange  for  my

agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential  Information.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Confidential  Information"  means  all  data,  information,  ideas,  concepts,
discoveries,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable  or  reduced  to  practice),  innovations,  improvements,  know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies,  and  all  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information  or  trade  secrets  in  any  form  or  medium  (whether  merely  remembered  or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential  business,  activities  and/or  operations  of  the  Company,  including,  without  limitation,  any  such  information  relating  to  or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during  the  period  of  Executive's  Service  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  any  Confidential  Information  or  other  confidential  or  proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use  such  information  only  for  certain  limited  purposes,  in  each  case,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  Executive  during  Executive's
Service. The  foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  information  that  (i)  was  known  to  the  public  prior  to  its  disclosure  to  Executive;  (ii)  becomes
generally  known  to  the  public  subsequent  to  disclosure  to  Executive  through  no  wrongful  act  of  Executive  or  any  representative  of
Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by
law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in
seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).

Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade  secret  law  for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  is  made  in  confidence  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade  secrets  in  a  complaint,  or  other  document,  filed  in  a  lawsuit,  or  other  proceeding,  if  such  filing  is  made  under  seal.  Finally,  if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

No  Company  policies  or  practices,  including  this  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  provision,  is  intended  to  or  shall  limit,
prevent, impede or interfere in any way with Executive's right, without prior notice to the Company,

to  provide  information  to  the  government,  participate  in  investigations,  testify  in  proceedings  regarding  the  Company's  past  or  future
conduct, or engage in any activities protected under whistle blower statutes.

2. NON-COMPETITION.  Executive  acknowledges  that  (i)  Executive  performs  services  of  a  unique  nature  for  the  Company  that  are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive  has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  Confidential  Information  which,  if  disclosed,  would  unfairly  and  inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  these  customers,  (v)  Executive  has  received  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted  Period"),  Executive  will  not  engage  in  any  business  activities,  directly  or  indirectly  (whether  as  an  employee,  consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the  Company  in  the  consumer  packaged  food  and  beverage  industry  ("Competitive  Business")  anywhere  within  the  same  geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
nothing  herein  shall  prohibit  Executive  from  being  a  passive  owner  of  not  more  than  three  percent  (3%)  of  the  equity  securities  of  a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.

3. NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately
preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on
behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue
of Executive's employment with the Company.

4. NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render  services  to  or  with  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  unaffiliated  with  the  Company  or  hire  or  retain  any  such
employee,  representative  or  agent,  or  take  any  action  to  materially  assist  or  aid  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce"  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  (i)  initiating  communications  with  a  Company  employee  relating  to  possible  employment,  (ii)
offering  bonuses  or  other  compensation  to  encourage  a  Company  employee  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  with  the  Company  and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.

5. NON-DISPARAGEMENT.  Executive  agrees  not  to  make  negative  comments  or  otherwise  disparage  the  Company  or  its  officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response  to  legal  process,  required  governmental  testimony  or  filings,  or  administrative  or  arbitral  proceedings  (including,  without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.

6.

INVENTIONS.

a. Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software,  know-how,  processes,  techniques,  methods,  works  of  authorship  and  other  work  product  ("Inventions"),  whether
patentable  or  unpatentable,  (A)  that  are  reduced  to  practice,  created,  invented,  designed,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  improved
with  the  use  of  any  Company  resources  and/or  within  the  scope  of  Executive's  work  with  the  Company  or  that  relate  to  the
business,  operations  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company,  and  that  are  made  or
conceived  by  Executive,  solely  or  jointly  with  others,  during  Executive's  Service,  or  (B)  suggested  by  any  work  that  Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall  belong  exclusively  to  the  Company  (or  its  designee),  whether  or  not  patent  or  other  applications  for  intellectual  property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent  rights  (the  "Applications").  Executive  will,  at  any  time  during  and  subsequent  to  Executive's  Service,  make  such
applications,  sign  such  papers,  take  all  rightful  oaths,  and  perform  all  other  acts  as  may  be  requested  from  time  to  time  by  the
Company  to  perfect,  record,  enforce,  protect,  patent  or  register  the  Company's  rights  in  the  Inventions,  all  without  additional
compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions  for  the  Company's  benefit,  all  without  additional  compensation  to  Executive  from  the  Company,  but  entirely  at  the
Company's expense.

b.

In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise  automatically  vest  in  the  Company,  Executive  hereby  irrevocably  conveys,  transfers  and  assigns  to  the  Company,  all
rights,  in  all  media  now  known  or  hereinafter  devised,  throughout  the  universe  and  in  perpetuity,  in  and  to  the  Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition,

Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions. To the extent that Executive has any rights in
the results and proceeds of Executive's service to the Company that cannot be assigned in the manner described herein, Executive
agrees to unconditionally waive the enforcement of such rights. Executive hereby waives any and all currently existing and future
monetary  rights  in  and  to  the  Inventions  and  all  patents  and  other  registrations  for  intellectual  property  that  may  issue  thereon,
including,  without  limitation,  any  rights  that  would  otherwise  accrue  to  Executive's  benefit  by  virtue  of  Executive  being  an
employee of or other service provider to the Company.

7. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).

8. REASONABLENESS  OF  COVENANTS.  In  signing  this  Agreement,  including  by  electronic  means,  Executive  gives  the  Company
assurance  that  Executive  has  carefully  read  and  considered  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  restraints
imposed  by  it.  Executive  agrees  that  these  restraints  are  necessary  for  the  reasonable  and  proper  protection  of  the  Company  and  its
Confidential  Information  and  that  each  and  every  one  of  the  restraints  is  reasonable  in  respect  to  subject  matter,  length  of  time  and
geographic  area,  and  that  these  restraints,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  will  not  prevent  Executive  from  obtaining  other  suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any  of  the  covenants  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  and  that  Executive  will  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  costs  (including  reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.  It  is  also  agreed  that  the  "Company"  as  used  in  this  Agreement  refers  to  each  of  the  Company's  Subsidiaries  and
Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to
that  Subsidiary  or  Affiliate  under  this  Agreement,  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  limitation  or  restriction  on  such  rights  of  the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.

9. REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.

10. REMEDIES.  Executive  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company's  remedies  at  law  for  a  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  any  of  the
provisions  of  Agreement  would  be  inadequate  and,  in  recognition  of  this  fact,  Executive  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable  relief  in  the  form  of  specific  performance,  a  temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction  or  any  other
equitable  remedy  which  may  then  be  available,  without  the  necessity  of  showing  actual  monetary  damages,  in  addition  to  any  other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.

11. REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's RSU and the Award Stock issued therefor (as such terms
are defined in the Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

12. TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

13. SURVIVAL  OF  PROVISIONS.  The  obligations  contained  in  this  Agreement  hereof  shall  survive  the  termination  or  expiration  of  the

Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.

14. VENUE,  PERSONAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  COVENANT  NOT  TO  SUE.  Executive  expressly  agrees  to  submit  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect  to  a  dispute  between  the  Company  and  Executive  in  relation  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement,  regardless  of  where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have  any  disputes  between  the  Company  and  Executive  related  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement  decided  in  any  jurisdiction  or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction,  application,  validity,  and  enforcement  of  this  Agreement,  and  any  disputes  or  controversies  arising  hereunder,  will  be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

APPENDIX I

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the
U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These  terms  and  conditions  are  in  addition  to,  or  if  so  indicated,  in  place  of  the  terms  and
conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in
the Plan and/or the Award Agreement.

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another  country  after  the  RSUs  are  granted  to  you,  or  are  considered  a  resident  of  another  country  for  local  law  purposes,  the  terms  and
conditions  contained  herein  may  not  be  applicable  to  you,  and  the  Company  shall,  in  its  discretion,  determine  to  what  extent  the  terms  and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.

NOTIFICATIONS

This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of
January 2018. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information  in  this  Appendix  I  as  the  only  source  of  information  relating  to  the  consequences  of  your  participation  in  the  Plan  because  the
information may be out of date at the time you vest in the RSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Plan.

In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.

Finally,  if  you  are  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  are  currently  working,  transfer  employment  and/or
residency after the RSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.

Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:

If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the RSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the RSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
Award  Agreement,  including  this  Appendix  I,  which  supersede  and  replace  any  prior  agreement,  either  written  or  verbal  (including  your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the RSUs.

Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the RSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  to  obtain  the  approval  of  any  governmental  or  regulatory  body  in  your  country  of  residence  (or  your  country  of  employment,  if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the RSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).

Termination.
The following provisions supplement the Termination section of the Award Agreement, provided, however, that for purposes of the section of
the  Award  Agreement  titled  "Settlement  of  Vested  RSUs,"  if  you  are  subject  to  U.S.  federal  income  tax  and  the  RSUs  constitute  Deferred
Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation from Service:

For  purposes  of  the  RSU,  your  employment  or  Service  relationship  will  be  considered  terminated  as  of  the  date  you  are  no  longer  actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment  Agreement,  if  any);  the  Committee  shall  have  the  exclusive  discretion  to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the RSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).

Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the RSUs upon termination due to Retirement set forth in the Termination section of
the  Award  Agreement,  if  the  Company  receives  an  opinion  of  counsel  that  there  has  been  a  legal  judgment  and/or  legal  development  in  a
particular jurisdiction that would likely result in the treatment in case of a termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Agreement
being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you
cease to provide Service and the RSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.

Termination for Cause.
The  implications  upon  a  termination  for  Cause  as  set  forth  in  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan  shall  only  be  enforced,  to  the  extent  deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge that your liability for Tax-Related Items may exceed the amount, if any, withheld by the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
Affiliates (as applicable).

If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Depending  on  the  withholding  method,  the  Company  may  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  considering  applicable  minimum
statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s), in which case
you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-
Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to
the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result
of any aspect of your participation in the Plan.

Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
The following provision supplements the Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries section of the Award Agreement:

If you are located outside the U.S., the RSUs may not be Transferred to a designated Beneficiary and may only be Transferred upon your death
to your legal heirs in accordance with applicable laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the RSUs be Transferred to another individual
during your lifetime.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge the following with respect to the RSUs:

(a)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights

or compensation.

(b)        In  no  event  should  the  RSUs,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan,  and  the  income  and  value  of  same,  be  considered  as

compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.

(c)    The RSUs, any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected compensation

or salary for any purpose.

(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local
currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the RSUs or
the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.

Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the RSUs under the Plan nor the issuance of the underlying
Shares upon vesting of the RSUs is intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (and country of employment, if
different).  The  Company  has  not  submitted  any  registration  statement,  prospectus  or  other  filings  to  the  local  securities  authorities  in
jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.

Language Consent.
If  you  are  resident  or  employed  outside  of  the  United  States,  you  acknowledge  and  agree  that  it  is  your  express  intent  that  this  Award
Agreement, the Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the RSUs, be drawn up
in English.

Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You  may  be  subject  to  insider  trading  restrictions  and/or  market  abuse  laws  based  on  the  exchange  on  which  the  Shares  are  listed  and  in
applicable  jurisdictions  including  the  United  States  and  your  country  or  your  broker’s  country,  if  different,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Plan during such times as
you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading  laws  and  regulations  may  prohibit  the  cancellation  or  amendment  of  orders  you  placed  before  you  possessed  inside  information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) “tipping” third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer  of  Shares  or  cash  (including  dividends,  dividend  equivalents  and  the  proceeds  arising  from  the  sale  of  Shares)  derived  from  your
participation  in  the  Plan,  to  and/or  from  a  brokerage/bank  account  or  legal  entity  located  outside  your  country.  The  applicable  laws  of  your
country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the
applicable  authorities  in  such  country.  You  acknowledge  that  you  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  any  applicable  foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.

No Advice Regarding Award.
The  Company  is  not  providing  any  tax,  legal  or  financial  advice,  nor  is  the  Company  making  any  recommendations  regarding  your
participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares. You understand and acknowledge that you should consult with
your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired upon
vesting of the RSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to
sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company for breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS/NOTIFICATIONS

AUSTRALIA

NOTIFICATIONS

Offer Document.

This offer document sets out information regarding the grant of RSUs to Australian resident employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  and  is  provided  by  the  Company  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  Plan  with  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission's
("ASIC's") Class Order 14/1000 and relevant provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.

In  addition  to  the  information  set  out  in  the  Award  Agreement,  you  also  are  being  provided  with  a  copy  of  the  Plan  (the  "Additional
Document").

The Additional Document provides further information to help you make an informed investment decision about participating in the Plan. The
Plan is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.

You should not rely upon any oral statements made in relation to this offer. You should rely only upon the statements contained in the Award
Agreement and the Additional Document when considering participation in the Plan.

Securities Law Notification
Investment in Shares involves a degree of risk. If you elect to participate in the Plan, you should monitor your participation and consider all risk
factors relevant to the acquisition of Shares under the Plan as set out in the Award Agreement and the Additional Document.

The  information  contained  in  this  offer  is  general  information  only.  It  is  not  advice  or  information  that  takes  into  account  your  objectives,
financial situation and needs.

You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Plan.

Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business
risks.

More  information  about  potential  factors  that  could  affect  the  Company's  business  and  financial  results  is  included  in  the  Company's  most
recent  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  the  Company's  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q.  Copies  of  these  reports  are  available  at
http://www.sec.gov/, on the Company's "Investor Relations" page at http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/, and upon request to the Company.

In addition, you should be aware that the Australian dollar value of any Shares acquired at vesting will be affected by the U.S. dollar/Australian
dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.

Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.

Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.

The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."

The  Shares  are  not  liable  to  any  further  calls  for  payment  of  capital  or  for  other  assessment  by  the  Company  and  have  no  sinking  fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.

Ascertaining the Market Price of Shares
You may ascertain the current market price of the Shares as traded on the Nasdaq at http://www.nasdaq.com under the symbol "KHC." The
Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.

This will not be a prediction of what the market price per Share will be when the RSUs vest or when the Shares are issued or of the applicable
exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.

Deferred Taxation.
Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act, 1997, applies to RSUs granted under the Plan, such that the RSUs are intended to be
subject to deferred taxation.

transactions unrelated to your employment or Service relationship, (ii) the Plan is not a part of the terms and conditions of your employment or

procédures judiciaires, exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement à, la présente convention.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided the sale of the
Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., Nasdaq).

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian  residents  are  required  to  report  any  specified  foreign  property  (including  Shares  and  RSUs)  on  form  T1135  (Foreign  Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Plan and may include the RSUs. The RSUs must
be  reported  -  generally  at  a  nil  cost  -  if  the  C$100,000  cost  threshold  is  exceeded  because  of  other  foreign  property  you  hold.  If  Shares  are
acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB")  of  the  Shares.  The  ACB  would  normally  equal  the  fair  market  value  of  the
Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a
personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

CHINA

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The  following  provisions  apply  if  you  are  subject  to  the  exchange  control  regulations  or  restrictions  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China
("China"), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:

Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Vesting, Termination and Settlement of Vested RSUs sections of the Award Agreement:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Award Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force the
sale of any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your

Service,  (iii)  following  your  transfer  to  another  Subsidiary  or  Affiliate  outside  of  China,  or  (iv)  within  any  other  timeframe  the  Company
determines  to  be  necessary  or  advisable.  You  agree  that  you  must  maintain  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan  in  an  account  at  a  broker
designated  by  the  Company  ("Designated  Account").  All  Shares  deposited  in  the  Designated  Account  cannot  be  transferred  out  of  that
Designated  Account.  Within  six  (6)  months  after  the  termination  of  your  Service  for  any  reason  (or  such  other  period  as  determined  by  the
Company  in  its  sole  discretion),  you  must  sell  all  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan.  The  Company  will  direct  the  automatic  sale  of  any  such
Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the expiration of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company
in its sole discretion).

You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant  to  this  authorization)  and  you  expressly  authorize  the  Company's  designated  broker  to  complete  the  sale  of  such  Shares.  You
acknowledge that the Company's designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any
obligation  to  satisfy  Tax-Related  Items.  You  agree  that  if  you  sell  Shares  that  you  acquire  under  the  Plan,  the  repatriation  requirements
described below shall apply.

If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of China,
you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The
Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or advisable to comply
with local regulations.

Exchange Control Restriction.
You  understand  and  agree  that,  due  to  exchange  control  laws  in  China,  you  will  be  required  to  immediately  repatriate  to  China  any  cash
proceeds acquired under the Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effected
through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby consent
and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds from your
participation in the Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) is under
no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate, and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due to exchange control
restrictions in China. You agree to bear the risk of any currency conversion rate fluctuation between the date that your proceeds are delivered to
such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.

You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance
with exchange control requirements in China.

You acknowledge that pursuant to Article 15 Law 50/1990 (Article 128 of the Colombian Labor Code) the Plan, the RSUs, the underlying
Shares, and any other amounts or payments granted or realized from participation in the Plan do not constitute a component of your “salary” for
any legal purpose. To this extent, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any and all labor benefits, such as
legal/fringe  benefits,  vacation  pay,  termination  or  other  indemnities,  payroll  taxes,  social  insurance  contributions  or  any  other  labor-related
amount which may be payable.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.

The  Shares  are  not  and  will  not  be  registered  with  the  Colombian  registry  of  publicly  traded  securities  (Registro  Nacional  de  Valores  y
Emisores) and, therefore, the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing in the Plan, this Award Agreement or any other
document evidencing the grant of the RSUs should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia.

Exchange Control Information.
You  are  responsible  for  complying  with  any  and  all  Colombian  foreign  exchange  restrictions,  approvals  and  reporting  requirements  in
connection  with  the  RSUs  and  the  Shares  you  acquire  or  funds  you  receive  under  the  Plan.    This  may  include  reporting  obligations  to  the
Central Bank (Banco de la República).  If applicable, you must determine whether you will treat your investments (e.g., the Shares) as (a) a
permanent investment or (b) a temporary investment as follows:

a) Permanent Investment:  If you determine that your investment will be permanent (i.e., because you wish to remain a shareholder), you

will be required to register such investment with the Central Bank, regardless of its value.

b) Temporary  /  Financial  Investment:    If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  determine  that  your  investment  will  be  temporary  (and  therefore
considered a “financial investment” under applicable regulations), you will be required to register such investment with the Central
Bank only if the aggregate value of the investment (as of December 31 for each year) is equal to or greater than USD 500,000.

In either case, you must file the Central Bank’s Form 11.  Colombian law does not provide specific criteria to differentiate between treatment as
a permanent investment or temporary / financial investment.  You should consult with your personal or legal advisor regarding any obligations
that you may have as a result of participating in the Plan.

necessary  for  the  performance  of  the  Award  Agreement  and  that  your  refusal  to  provide  such  Data  would  make  it  impossible  for  the
Company to perform its contractual obligations and may affect your ability to participate in the Plan.

The Controller of personal Data processing is The Kraft Heinz Company, One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, U.S.A. Heinz

obligations related to the implementation, administration and management of the Plan, which represents the legal basis for the processing.
You  understand  that  Data  processing  relating  to  the  purposes  above  specified  shall  take  place  under  automated  or  non-automated

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Italian  residents  who,  during  the  fiscal  year,  hold  investments  abroad  or  foreign  financial  assets  (e.g.,  cash,  Shares  and  RSUs)  which  may
generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no
tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or foreign
financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and RSUs), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering provisions.

Tax on Foreign Financial Assets.
Italian residents may be subject to tax on the value of financial assets held outside of Italy. The taxable amount will be the fair market value of
the financial assets, including Shares assessed at the end of the calendar year. If you are subject to this foreign financial assets tax, you will
need  to  report  the  value  of  your  financial  assets  held  abroad  in  your  annual  tax  return.  You  are  encouraged  to  consult  your  personal  legal

Modification.

Notifications

Securities Law Information.

WARNING - You are being offered RSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the RSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted  on  the  Nasdaq.  This  means  you  may  be  able  to  sell  them  on  the  Nasdaq  if  there  are  interested  buyers.  You  may  get  less  than  you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.

If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.

New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme.  As  a  result,  you  may  not  be  given  all  the  information  usually  required.  You  will  also  have  fewer  other  legal  protections  for  this
investment.

In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).

Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

account or financial institution. You are required to retain the documents connected with a foreign exchange transaction for a period of five (5)
years, as measured from the end of the year in which such transaction occurred.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Polish residents holding foreign securities (e.g., Shares) and/or maintaining accounts abroad must report information to the National Bank of
Poland  on  transactions  and  balances  of  the  securities  and  cash  deposited  in  such  accounts  if  the  value  of  such  securities  and  cash  (when
combined with all other assets possessed abroad) exceeds PLN 7 million. If required, the reports must be filed on a quarterly basis on special
forms that are available on the website of the National Bank of Poland.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Data Privacy Acknowledgment.
You hereby acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms regarding collection, processing and transfer of Data contained in the
Data Privacy Section of the Award Agreement and by participating in the Plan, you agree to such terms. In this regard, upon request of the
Company  or  your  employer,  you  agree  to  provide  an  executed  data  privacy  consent  form  to  your  employer  or  the  Company  (or  any  other
agreements or consents that may be required by your employer or the Company) that the Company and/or your employer may deem necessary
to obtain under the data privacy laws in your country, either now or in the future. You understand that you will not be able to participate in the
Plan if you fail to execute any such consent or agreement.

U.S. Transaction.
You understand that your acceptance of the RSUs results in a contract between you and the Company that is completed in the United States and
that the Award Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. You
are not permitted to sell the Shares directly to other Russian legal entities or individuals.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
Your employer is not in any way involved with the offer of the RSUs or administration of the Plan. The Award Agreement, the Plan and all
other materials you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent
any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; hence, the securities
described  in  any  Plan-related  documents  may  not  be  used  for  offering  or  public  circulation  in  Russia.  In  no  event  will  Shares  issued  upon
vesting of the RSUs be delivered to you in Russia; all Shares will be maintained on your behalf in the United States of America.

Exchange Control Information.
Under  current  exchange  control  regulations,  within  a  reasonably  short  time  after  sale  of  the  Shares  acquired  under  the  Plan  or  receipt  of
dividends on the Shares, you must repatriate the sale proceeds or dividends to Russia. Such funds must be initially credited to you through a
foreign  currency  account  at  an  authorized  bank  in  Russia.  After  the  funds  are  initially  received  in  Russia,  they  may  be  further  remitted  to
foreign banks subject to the following limitations: (i) the foreign account may be opened only for individuals; (ii) the foreign account may not
be used for business activities; and (iii) you must give notice to the Russian tax authorities about the opening/closing of each foreign account
within one month of the account opening/closing. Cash dividends (but not dividend equivalents) and cash income received from the transfer of
funds and/or Shares into the fiduciary/trust management of a non-resident do not need to be remitted to your bank account in Russia but instead
can  be  remitted  directly  to  a  foreign  individual  bank  account  (in  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  ("OECD")  and
Financial Action Task Force ("FATF") countries (such as the United States)). As from January 1, 2018, cash proceeds from the sale of Shares
listed on the Russian stock exchange or a foreign exchange on the legally approved list, also can be paid directly to your foreign bank account
opened with a bank located in an OECD or FATF country.

You  are  encouraged  to  contact  your  personal  advisor  before  remitting  your  sale  proceeds  or  any  dividends  to  Russia  as  exchange  control
requirements may change and significant penalties apply in the case of non-compliance with the exchange control requirements.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Russian residents are required to notify Russian tax authorities within one (1) month of opening, closing or changing the details of a foreign
account. Russian residents also are required to report (i) the beginning and ending balances in such a foreign bank account each year and (ii)
transactions related to such a foreign account during the year to the Russian tax authorities, on or before June 1 of the following year. The tax
authorities can require you to provide appropriate supporting documents related to transactions in a foreign bank account.

Anti-Corruption Notice.
Anti-corruption  laws  prohibit  certain  public  servants,  their  spouses  and  their  dependent  children  from  owning  any  foreign  source  financial
instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should

inform the Company if you are covered by these laws because you should not hold Shares acquired under the Plan.

SINGAPORE

been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the grant of the RSUs is not made with a view to the
RSUs or Shares being subsequently offered to another party. You  should  note  that  the  RSUs  are  subject  to  section  257  of  the  SFA  and  you
should not make any subsequent sale of Shares in Singapore or any offer of such subsequent sale of Shares subject to the awards in Singapore,

Division (1) Subdivision (4) (other than section 280) of the SFA.

Affiliate, you are subject to certain notification requirements under the Singapore Companies Act. Among these requirements is an obligation
to notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate in writing when you receive an interest (e.g., RSUs, Shares) in the Company, a Subsidiary or
Affiliate. In addition, you must notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate when you sell Shares (including when you sell Shares issued upon
vesting and settlement of the RSUs). These notifications must be made within two (2) business days of acquiring or disposing of any interest in

any fines or penalties resulting from your failure to comply with applicable laws.

SPAIN

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the first paragraph of the Acknowledgment of Nature of Award section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and
Conditions section of this Appendix I:

By accepting the grant of the RSUs, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSUs under the Plan to individuals who may
be employees of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates throughout the world. The

decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise
bind the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on an ongoing basis except as provided in the Plan. Consequently, you understand that the
RSUs  are  granted  on  the  assumption  and  condition  that  the  RSUs  or  the  Shares  acquired  upon  vesting  shall  not  become  a  part  of  any
employment contract with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes
(including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for
the  assumptions  and  conditions  referred  to  above;  thus,  you  acknowledge  and  freely  accept  that  should  any  or  all  of  the  assumptions  be
mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the RSUs shall be null and void.

You  understand  and  agree  that,  unless  otherwise  provided  in  the  Award  Agreement,  the  vesting  and  settlement  of  the  RSUs  is  expressly
conditioned  on  your  continuous  Service  such  that  if  your  employment  or  rendering  of  Services  terminates  for  any  reason  whatsoever,  your
RSUs  will  cease  vesting  immediately  effective  as  of  the  date  of  such  termination  for  any  reason  including,  but  not  limited  to,  resignation,
retirement, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without cause (i.e., subject to a
"despido improcedente"), individual or collective dismissal on objective grounds, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause,
material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers' Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers' Statute,
and/or  Article  50  of  the  Workers'  Statute,  unilateral  withdrawal  by  your  employer  and  under  Article  10.3  of  the  Royal  Decree  1382/1985.
Consequently,  upon  termination  for  any  of  the  above  reasons,  you  will  automatically  lose  any  rights  to  the  RSUs  granted  to  you  that  were
unvested on the date of termination, as described in the Award Agreement.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
The  RSUs  and  the  Shares  issued  pursuant  to  the  vesting  of  the  RSUs  do  not  qualify  under  Spanish  regulations  as  securities.  No  "offer  of
securities to the public," as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Award Agreement has not
been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and does not constitute a public offering prospectus.

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Spanish resident, you must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Shares to the Dirección General de Comercial e
Inversiones  (the  "DGCI")  of  the  Ministerio  de  Economia  for  statistical  purposes.  This  declaration  must  be  made  in  January  for  any  Shares
owned as of December 31 of the prior year by filing a form D-6 with the DGCI; however, if the value of the Shares being reported exceeds
€1,502,530 (or if you hold 10% or more of the share capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of
Directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or disposition of the Shares, as applicable. In addition, if you
wish to import the ownership title of any Shares (i.e., share certificates) into Spain, you must declare the importation of such securities to the
DGCI.

You  also  are  required  to  declare  electronically  to  the  Bank  of  Spain  any  foreign  accounts  (including  brokerage  accounts  held  abroad),  any
foreign instruments (including Shares) and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of Shares made pursuant to the
Plan) held in such accounts if the value of the transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the
prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000.

To the extent that you hold rights or assets (e.g., Shares acquired under the Plan or cash held in a bank or brokerage account) outside Spain with

(i)

Vesting. The Performance Share Award will vest on the “Vesting Date” set forth in the Notice provided that you remain
employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise set forth in the Omnibus Plan or this Award
Agreement. Prior to the vesting and settlement of the Performance Share Award, you will not have any rights of a
shareholder with respect to the Performance Share Award or the Shares subject thereto. No Shares will be delivered
pursuant to the vesting of the Performance Share Award unless (i) you have complied with your obligations under this
Award Agreement and the Omnibus Plan and (ii) the vesting of the Performance Share Award and the delivery of such
Shares complies with applicable law. Until such time as the Shares are delivered to you (as evidenced by the
appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have
no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding
the vesting of the Performance Share Award.
Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, any Performance
Share Award that becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered
in the Participant’s name. In the event the Performance Share Award Share Payout is to be made in Shares results in
less than a whole number of Shares, the Performance Share Award Share Payout shall be rounded up or down to the

treated in accordance with the Notice.

no later than March 15 of the taxable year following the end of the Performance Period and (B) a Performance Share
Award that becomes payable under Section 3(b)(i), 3(b)(ii), or 3(b)(iii) shall be paid no later than 60 days after the
Vesting Date.
Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If
you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to
such termination of your Service, the Company determines that your Service could have been terminated for Cause,
subject to anything to the contrary that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your
Service will, at the election of the Company, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause for purposes of this Award
Agreement and the Omnibus Plan, effective as of the date the events giving rise to Cause occurred and any
consequences

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay gains that
would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).

(b)

Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i)

(ii)

The Performance Share Award shall not become payable to the Participant or his or her legal representative unless and
until the Participant or his or her legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-
Related Items (as defined in Section 5 below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.
The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to
the fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on
which the Shares are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any
state or federal law or under rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or
other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary and
advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the
Shares would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or
other clearance from any state, federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable and (D) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the
date the Performance Share Award becomes payable as the Committee may from time to time establish for reasons of
administrative convenience, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(c)

Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide for full or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of a Participant’s active employment for
any reason prior to the completion of a Performance Period to which a Performance Share Award relates; provided that the
Committee shall not exercise such discretion if doing so would cause other Performance Share Awards that are intended to
qualify as Qualified Performance-Based Compensation not to qualify.

4. Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant’s employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or

all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant’s participation in
the Omnibus Plan and legally applicable to the Participant (“Tax-Related Items”), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate
liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount
actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. Furthermore, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer
(a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the
Performance Share Award, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award or the
subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to
structure the terms of the grant of the Performance Share Award or any aspect of the Participant’s participation in the Omnibus Plan to
reduce or eliminate his or her liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. If the Participant becomes subject to
Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event,
as applicable, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be
required to withhold or account for (including report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of
the Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the number
of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from a Performance Share Award Share Payout
or  otherwise  becoming  subject  to  current  taxation.  If  the  Company  satisfies  the  Tax-Related  Items  obligation  by  withholding  a  number  of
Shares as described

herein,  for  tax  purposes,  the  Participant  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  the  full  number  of  Shares  due  to  the  Participant  at  vesting,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items withholding.

The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting or payment of
this Performance Share Award, the sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award or hypothetical withholding tax amounts if
the Participant is covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts from any
proceeds realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by the Participant. Such
open-market sale is on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization.

Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,
vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be,
by withholding from the Participant’s wages, or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.

If the Participant is subject to the short-swing profit rules of Section 16(b) of the Act, the Participant may elect the form of withholding
in advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the number
of  Shares  having  an  aggregate  value  equal  to  the  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  withholding  due  from  the  Performance  Share  Award  Share
Payout, or the Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.

Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at
the Fair Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount giving rise
to the withholding requirement first became includible in the gross income of the Participant under applicable tax laws. The Company may
refuse  to  issue  or  deliver  the  Shares  if  the  Participant  fails  to  comply  with  his  or  her  Tax-Related  Items  obligations.  To  avoid  negative
accounting treatment, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding
amounts or other applicable withholding rates.

The Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be
required to withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If the Participant is covered by a Company tax equalization
policy, the Participant also agrees to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and
conditions of such tax equalization policy.

(a)

the Omnibus Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,

Participant’s employment or service contract, if any;

the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of normal compensation

or salary from the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the
Company, the Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;

(m)

no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Share Award resulting

from failure to reach Performance Goals or termination of the Participant’s employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason
whatsoever and whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country where the Participant resides or later found to be invalid), and
in consideration of the grant of the Performance Share Award to which the Participant is otherwise not entitled, the Participant irrevocably
agrees never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases
the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and
agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims; and

Participant’s country. If the Participant resides outside the United States, the Participant understands that he or she may request a list with
the  names  and  addresses  of  any  potential  recipients  of  the  Data  by  contacting  his  or  her  local  human  resources  representative.  The

EXHIBIT B

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT

I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or
its  Affiliates  (collectively  the  "Company"),  and  will  learn  and  have  access  to  the  Company's  confidential,  trade  secret  and  proprietary
information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are
unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to
protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other
equity grants unless I made such promises.

In  addition  to  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  I  am  expressly  being  given  PSUs  or  other  equity  grants  in  exchange  for  my

agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to
Confidential  Information.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Confidential  Information"  means  all  data,  information,  ideas,  concepts,
discoveries,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable  or  reduced  to  practice),  innovations,  improvements,  know-how,
developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and
strategies,  and  all  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information  or  trade  secrets  in  any  form  or  medium  (whether  merely  remembered  or
embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or
potential  business,  activities  and/or  operations  of  the  Company,  including,  without  limitation,  any  such  information  relating  to  or
concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners
and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or
otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either
during  the  period  of  Executive's  Service  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  any  Confidential  Information  or  other  confidential  or  proprietary
information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to
use  such  information  only  for  certain  limited  purposes,  in  each  case,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  Executive  during  Executive's
Service. The  foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  information  that  (i)  was  known  to  the  public  prior  to  its  disclosure  to  Executive;  (ii)  becomes
generally known to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of Executive or any

representative of Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the
extent  permitted  by  law,  Executive  provides  the  Company  with  prior  notice  of  the  contemplated  disclosure  and  cooperates  with  the
Company at its expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).

Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State
Trade  secret  law  for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  is  made  in  confidence  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local
government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose
trade  secrets  in  a  complaint,  or  other  document,  filed  in  a  lawsuit,  or  other  proceeding,  if  such  filing  is  made  under  seal.  Finally,  if
Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the
trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade
secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

No  Company  policies  or  practices,  including  this  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  provision,  is  intended  to  or  shall  limit,
prevent,  impede  or  interfere  in  any  way  with  Executive's  right,  without  prior  notice  to  the  Company,  to  provide  information  to  the
government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities
protected under whistle blower statutes.

2. NON-COMPETITION.  Executive  acknowledges  that  (i)  Executive  performs  services  of  a  unique  nature  for  the  Company  that  are
irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)
Executive  has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  Confidential  Information  which,  if  disclosed,  would  unfairly  and  inappropriately
assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would
inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive
has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  these  customers,  (v)  Executive  has  received  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  the
Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.
Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the
"Restricted  Period"),  Executive  will  not  engage  in  any  business  activities,  directly  or  indirectly  (whether  as  an  employee,  consultant,
officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,
or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a
capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with
the  Company  in  the  consumer  packaged  food  and  beverage  industry  ("Competitive  Business")  anywhere  within  the  same  geographic
territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
nothing  herein  shall  prohibit  Executive  from  being  a  passive  owner  of  not  more  than  three  percent  (3%)  of  the  equity  securities  of  a
publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive has no active participation
in the business of such corporation.

3. NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,
induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer
of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly
or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to
do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers

who, during the two (2) years immediately preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or
with which the Executive had contact on behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had
access to confidential information by virtue of Executive's employment with the Company.

4. NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's
duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid
or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or
render  services  to  or  with  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  unaffiliated  with  the  Company  or  hire  or  retain  any  such
employee,  representative  or  agent,  or  take  any  action  to  materially  assist  or  aid  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  in
identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in
interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or
induce"  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  (i)  initiating  communications  with  a  Company  employee  relating  to  possible  employment,  (ii)
offering  bonuses  or  other  compensation  to  encourage  a  Company  employee  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  with  the  Company  and
accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a
Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for
a period of six (6) months thereafter.

5. NON-DISPARAGEMENT.  Executive  agrees  not  to  make  negative  comments  or  otherwise  disparage  the  Company  or  its  officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)
response  to  legal  process,  required  governmental  testimony  or  filings,  or  administrative  or  arbitral  proceedings  (including,  without
limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.

6.

INVENTIONS.

a. Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,
software,  know-how,  processes,  techniques,  methods,  works  of  authorship  and  other  work  product  ("Inventions"),  whether
patentable  or  unpatentable,  (A)  that  are  reduced  to  practice,  created,  invented,  designed,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  improved
with  the  use  of  any  Company  resources  and/or  within  the  scope  of  Executive's  work  with  the  Company  or  that  relate  to  the
business,  operations  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company,  and  that  are  made  or
conceived  by  Executive,  solely  or  jointly  with  others,  during  Executive's  Service,  or  (B)  suggested  by  any  work  that  Executive
performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own
time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,
shall  belong  exclusively  to  the  Company  (or  its  designee),  whether  or  not  patent  or  other  applications  for  intellectual  property
protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the
Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the
Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other
intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,
together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and
equivalent  rights  (the  "Applications").  Executive  will,  at  any  time  during  and  subsequent  to  Executive's  Service,  make  such
applications,  sign  such  papers,  take  all  rightful  oaths,  and  perform  all  other  acts  as  may  be  requested  from  time  to  time  by  the
Company to perfect, record, enforce, protect, patent or register the Company's rights in the Inventions, all without additional

compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the
Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the
Inventions  for  the  Company's  benefit,  all  without  additional  compensation  to  Executive  from  the  Company,  but  entirely  at  the
Company's expense.

b.

In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on
behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights
therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to
Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not
otherwise  automatically  vest  in  the  Company,  Executive  hereby  irrevocably  conveys,  transfers  and  assigns  to  the  Company,  all
rights,  in  all  media  now  known  or  hereinafter  devised,  throughout  the  universe  and  in  perpetuity,  in  and  to  the  Inventions,
including, without limitation, all of Executive's right, title and interest in the copyrights (and all renewals, revivals and extensions
thereof) to the Inventions, including, without limitation, all rights of any kind or any nature now or hereafter recognized, including,
without limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow
others to exploit the Inventions and all rights to sue at law or in equity for any infringement, or other unauthorized use or conduct
in derogation of the Inventions, known or unknown, prior to the date hereof, including, without limitation, the right to receive all
proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.
To  the  extent  that  Executive  has  any  rights  in  the  results  and  proceeds  of  Executive's  service  to  the  Company  that  cannot  be
assigned  in  the  manner  described  herein,  Executive  agrees  to  unconditionally  waive  the  enforcement  of  such  rights.  Executive
hereby  waives  any  and  all  currently  existing  and  future  monetary  rights  in  and  to  the  Inventions  and  all  patents  and  other
registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue
to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.

7. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any
time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,
any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property
belonging to the Company).

8. REASONABLENESS  OF  COVENANTS.  In  signing  this  Agreement,  including  by  electronic  means,  Executive  gives  the  Company
assurance  that  Executive  has  carefully  read  and  considered  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  restraints
imposed  by  it.  Executive  agrees  that  these  restraints  are  necessary  for  the  reasonable  and  proper  protection  of  the  Company  and  its
Confidential  Information  and  that  each  and  every  one  of  the  restraints  is  reasonable  in  respect  to  subject  matter,  length  of  time  and
geographic  area,  and  that  these  restraints,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  will  not  prevent  Executive  from  obtaining  other  suitable
employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a
unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood
while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of
any  of  the  covenants  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  and  that  Executive  will  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  costs  (including  reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on
any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.  It  is  also  agreed  that  the  "Company"  as  used  in  this  Agreement  refers  to  each  of  the  Company's  Subsidiaries  and
Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all of Executive's obligations to
that  Subsidiary  or  Affiliate  under  this  Agreement,  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  limitation  or  restriction  on  such  rights  of  the
Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.

9. REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction
may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.

10. REMEDIES.  Executive  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company's  remedies  at  law  for  a  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  any  of  the
provisions  of  Agreement  would  be  inadequate  and,  in  recognition  of  this  fact,  Executive  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or
threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain
equitable  relief  in  the  form  of  specific  performance,  a  temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction  or  any  other
equitable  remedy  which  may  then  be  available,  without  the  necessity  of  showing  actual  monetary  damages,  in  addition  to  any  other
equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.

11. REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term
is used in the Omnibus Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof
(as such terms are defined in the Omnibus Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms
of the Omnibus Plan.

12. TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

13. SURVIVAL  OF  PROVISIONS.  The  obligations  contained  in  this  Agreement hereof  shall  survive  the  termination  or  expiration  of  the

Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.

14. VENUE,  PERSONAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  COVENANT  NOT  TO  SUE.  Executive  expressly  agrees  to  submit  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with
respect  to  a  dispute  between  the  Company  and  Executive  in  relation  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement,  regardless  of  where
Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to
have  any  disputes  between  the  Company  and  Executive  related  to  this  Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement  decided  in  any  jurisdiction  or
venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. Executive hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection
which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and
Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive
Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a court in the State of Delaware. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction,  application,  validity,  and  enforcement  of  this  Agreement,  and  any  disputes  or  controversies  arising  hereunder,  will  be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the
terms and conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix I have the meanings set
forth in the Omnibus Plan and/or the Award Agreement.

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another  country  after  the  PSUs  are  granted  to  you,  or  are  considered  a  resident  of  another  country  for  local  law  purposes,  the  terms  and
conditions  contained  herein  may  not  be  applicable  to  you,  and  the  Company  shall,  in  its  discretion,  determine  to  what  extent  the  terms  and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.

NOTIFICATIONS

This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan.  The  information  is  based  on  the  securities,  exchange  control,  and  other  laws  in  effect  in  the  respective
countries as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not
rely on the information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Omnibus
Plan because the information may be out of date at the time you vest in the PSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan.

In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.

Finally,  if  you  are  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  are  currently  working,  transfer  employment  and/or
residency after the PSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.

Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Award Agreement, generally:

If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the PSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the PSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Omnibus Plan
and the Award Agreement, including this Appendix I, which supersede and replace any prior agreement, either written or verbal (including your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the PSUs.

Vesting.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the PSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  to  obtain  the  approval  of  any  governmental  or  regulatory  body  in  your  country  of  residence  (or  your  country  of  employment,  if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the PSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately or within a specified period following your termination of Service (in which case, this Award Agreement shall give the Company
the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).

Termination.
The following provisions supplement the termination of services provisions of the Award Notice and Agreement, provided, however, that if you
are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the PSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your
Separation from Service:

For  purposes  of  the  PSU,  your  employment  or  Service  relationship  will  be  considered  terminated  as  of  the  date  you  are  no  longer  actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Award Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the
PSU under the Omnibus Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service
would  not  include  any  contractual  notice  period  or  any  period  of  "garden  leave"  or  similar  period  mandated  under  employment  laws  in  the
jurisdiction where you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion
to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).

Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the PSUs upon termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Notice and
Agreement,  if  the  Company  receives  an  opinion  of  counsel  that  there  has  been  a  legal  judgment  and/or  legal  development  in  a  particular
jurisdiction  that  would  likely  result  in  the  treatment  in  case  of  a  termination  due  to  Retirement  as  set  forth  in  the  Award  Agreement  being
deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the provisions for termination due to Retirement at the time you cease
to provide Service and the PSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.

Termination for Cause.
The  implications  upon  a  termination  for  Cause  as  set  forth  in  the  Award  Agreement  and  Plan  shall  only  be  enforced,  to  the  extent  deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Award Agreement:

You  acknowledge  that  your  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  may  exceed  the  amount  withheld  by  the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  and/or  its
Affiliates (as applicable).

If you have become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

Depending  on  the  withholding  method,  the  Company  may  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  considering  applicable  minimum
statutory  withholding  amounts  or  other  applicable  withholding  rates,  including  maximum  applicable  rates,  in  which  case  you  may  receive  a
refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is
satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested PSUs,
notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of
your participation in the Omnibus Plan.

Acknowledgment of Nature of Award.
The following provisions supplement the Nature of Grant section of the Award Agreement:

You acknowledge the following with respect to the PSUs:

(a)       The  PSUs,  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Omnibus  Plan,  and  the  income  and  value  of  same,  are  not  intended  to  replace  any

pension rights or compensation.

(b)    In no event should the PSUs, any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan, and the income and value of same, be considered as

compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate.

(c)    The PSU, any Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and the income and value of same are not part of normal or expected

compensation or salary for any purpose.

(d)    Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your
local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the PSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to vesting of the PSUs
or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.

Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the PSUs under the Omnibus Plan nor the issuance of the
underlying  Shares  upon  vesting  of  the  PSUs  is  intended  to  be  a  public  offering  of  securities  in  your  country  of  residence  (and  country  of
employment,  if  different).  The  Company  has  not  submitted  any  registration  statement,  prospectus  or  other  filings  to  the  local  securities
authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.

Language Consent.
If  you  are  resident  or  employed  outside  of  the  United  States,  you  acknowledge  and  agree  that  it  is  your  express  intent  that  this  Award
Agreement, the Omnibus Plan and all other documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to the PSUs, be
drawn up in English.

Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
Depending  on  your  country,  you  may  be  subject  to  insider  trading  restrictions  and/or  market  abuse  laws,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to
acquire  or  sell  Shares  or  rights  to  Shares  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  during  such  times  as  you  are  considered  to  have  "inside  information"
regarding  the  Company  (as  defined  by  the  laws  in  your  country).  Any  restrictions  under  these  laws  or  regulations  are  separate  from  and  in
addition to any restrictions that may be imposed

under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions,
and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer  of  Shares  or  cash  (including  dividends,  dividend  equivalents  and  the  proceeds  arising  from  the  sale  of  Shares)  derived  from  your
participation in the Omnibus Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of
your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to
the  applicable  authorities  in  such  country.  You  acknowledge  that  you  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  any  applicable  foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.

No Advice Regarding Award.
The  Company  is  not  providing  any  tax,  legal  or  financial  advice,  nor  is  the  Company  making  any  recommendations  regarding  your
participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan,  or  your  acquisition  or  sale  of  the  underlying  Shares.  You  are  hereby  advised  to  consult  with  your  own
personal  tax,  legal  and  financial  advisors  regarding  your  participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan  before  taking  any  action  related  to  the  Omnibus
Plan.

Imposition of Other Requirements.
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Omnibus Plan, on the PSUs and on any Shares issued
upon vesting of the PSUs, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require
you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Waiver.
You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company or breach of any provision of the Award Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Award Agreement.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Omnibus Plan, if any,
provided the sale of the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e.,
NASDAQ).

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian  residents  are  required  to  report  any  foreign  property  (including  Shares  and  PSUs)  on  form  T1135  (Foreign  Income  Verification
Statement)  if  the  total  cost  of  your  foreign  property  exceeds  C$100,000  at  any  time  in  the  year.  The  form  must  be  filed  by  April  30  of  the
following year. Foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and may include the PSUs. The PSUs must be reported -
generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If Shares are acquired, their cost
generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value of the Shares at vesting, but if
you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should speak with a personal tax advisor to
determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this requirement.

Italian  residents  who,  during  the  fiscal  year,  hold  investments  abroad  or  foreign  financial  assets  (e.g.,  cash,  Shares  and  PSUs)  which  may

on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), you will have no right to vote or

receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the vesting of the

Performance Share Award.

(ii)

Performance Share Award Payment. Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement, any Performance

Share Award that becomes payable shall be made in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered

in your name. In the event the

Performance  Share  Award  Share  Payout  is  to  be  made  in  Shares  results  in  less  than  a  whole  number  of  Shares,  the

Performance  Share  Award  Share  Payout  shall  be  rounded  up  or  down  to  the  next  whole  Share  (no  fractional  Shares

shall be issued in payment of a Performance Share Award). Any Shares issued in respect of a Performance Share Award

Share Payout shall be issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Plan and shall reduce the number of

Shares available for issuance thereunder.

(iii)

Dividends. Any  cash  dividend  the  Board  declares  with  respect  to  the  Shares  during  the  Performance  Period  shall  be

treated in accordance with the Notice.

(iv)

Payment  Timing.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  21  hereof  or  in  the  Notice,  as  applicable,  (A)  the

Performance Share Award payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the Vesting Date, but in any event

no  later  than  March  15  of  the  taxable  year  following  such  date  and  (B)  a  Performance  Share  Award  that  becomes

payable due to a termination Without Cause, or termination due to your Retirement, death or Disability, shall be paid no

later than 60 days after the Vesting Date.

(v)

Payout Upon Termination. The Notice shall set forth the effect of termination upon the Performance Share Award. If

you are terminated Without Cause or due to your resignation and, within the twelve (12) month period subsequent to

such  termination  of  your  Service,  the  Company  determines  that  your  Service  could  have  been  terminated  for  Cause,

subject to anything to the contrary that may be contained in the Notice at the time of termination of your Service, your

Service  will,  at  the  election  of  the  Company,  be  deemed  to  have  been  terminated  for  Cause  for  purposes  of  this

Agreement  and  the  Omnibus  Plan,  effective  as  of  the  date  the  events  giving  rise  to  Cause  occurred  and  any

consequences following from a termination for Cause shall be retroactively applied (including your obligation to repay

gains that would not have been realized had your Service been terminated for Cause).

(b)

Conditions to Payment of Performance Share Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

(i)

The  Performance  Share  Award  shall  not  become  payable  to  you  or  your  legal  representative  unless  and  until  you  or

your legal representative shall have satisfied all applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in

Section 5 below), if any, in accordance with Section 5 hereof.

(ii)

The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares in payment of the Performance Share Award prior to

the fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on

which the Shares are then listed, (B) the completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any

state  or  federal  law  or  under  rulings  or  regulations  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the

“Commission”) or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion,

deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the Shares is not

so  registered,  a  determination  by  the  Company  that  the  issuance  of  the  Shares  would  be  exempt  from  any  such

registration or qualification requirements, (C) the obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state, federal or

foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable

and  (D)  the  lapse  of  any  such  reasonable  period  of  time  following  the  date  the  Performance  Share  Award  becomes

payable  as  the  Committee  may  from  time  to  time  establish  for  reasons  of  administrative  convenience,  subject  to

compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(c)

Committee Discretion. Anything to the contrary in this Section 3 notwithstanding, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,

provide for full or partial payment of the Performance Share Award upon termination of your active employment for any reason

prior  to  the  completion  of  a  Performance  Period  to  which  a  Performance  Share  Award  relates;  provided  that  the  Committee

shall  not  exercise  such  discretion  if  doing  so  would  cause  other  Performance  Share  Awards  that  are  intended  to  qualify  as

Qualified Performance-Based Compensation not to qualify.

4. Withholding Taxes. Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, your employer (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any

or  all  income  tax,  social  insurance,  payroll  tax,  payment  on  account  or  other  tax-related  items  related  to  your  participation  in  the

Omnibus  Plan  and  legally  applicable  to  you  (“Tax-Related Items”),  you  acknowledge  that  the  ultimate  liability  for  all  Tax-Related

Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or

the  Employer.  Furthermore,  you  acknowledge  that  the  Company  and/or  the  Employer  (a)  make  no  representations  or  undertakings

regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Award, including, but not

limited to, the grant, vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award or the subsequent sale of Shares issued in payment of the

Performance Share Award; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant of the Performance

Share  Award  or  any  aspect  of  your  participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan  to  reduce  or  eliminate  your  liability  for  Tax-Related  Items  or

achieve any particular tax result. If you are or become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge

that  the  Company  and/or  the  Employer  (or  former  employer,  as  applicable)  may  be  required  to  withhold  or  account  for  (including

report) Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

The Company is authorized to satisfy the withholding for any or all Tax-Related Items arising from the granting, vesting, or payment of

the Performance Share Award or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case may be, by deducting the

number  of  Shares  having  an  aggregate  value  equal  to  the  amount  of  Tax-Related  Items  withholding  due  from  a  Performance  Share

Award Share Payout or otherwise becoming subject to current taxation. If the Company satisfies the Tax-Related Items obligation by

withholding  a  number  of  Shares  as  described  herein,  for  tax  purposes,  you  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  the  full  number  of

Shares due to you at vesting, notwithstanding that a number of Shares is held back solely for the purpose of such Tax-Related Items

withholding.

The Company is also authorized to satisfy the actual Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting, vesting or payment of

this  Performance  Share  Award,  the  sale  of  Shares  issued  pursuant  to  the  Performance  Share  Award  or  hypothetical  withholding  tax

amounts if you are covered under a Company tax equalization policy, as the case may be, by the remittance of the required amounts

from any proceeds realized upon the open-market sale of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award by

you. Such open-market sale is on your behalf and at your direction pursuant to this authorization.

Furthermore, the Company and/or the Employer are authorized to satisfy the Tax-Related Items withholding arising from the granting,

vesting, or payment of this Performance Share Award, or sale of Shares issued pursuant to the Performance Share Award, as the case

may be, by withholding from your wages, or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer.

If  you  are  subject  to  the  short-swing  profit  rules  of  Section  16(b)  of  the  Act,  the  Participant  may  elect  the  form  of  withholding  in

advance of any Tax-Related Items withholding event, and in the absence of the Participant’s election, the Company shall deduct the

number of Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Tax-Related Items withholding due from the Performance Share

Award Share Payout, or the Committee may determine that a particular method be used to satisfy any Tax Related Items withholding.

Shares deducted from the payment of this Performance Share Award in satisfaction of Tax-Related Items withholding shall be valued at

the Fair Market Value of the Shares received in payment of the vested Performance Share Award on the date as of which the amount

giving rise to the withholding requirement first became includible in your gross income under applicable tax laws. The Company may

refuse  to  issue  or  deliver  the  Shares  if  you  fail  to  comply  with  your  Tax-Related  Items  obligations.  Depending  on  the  withholding

method,  the  Company  may  withhold  or  account  for  Tax-Related  Items  by  considering  applicable  minimum  statutory  withholding

amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in your jurisdiction(s).

You shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to

withhold that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. If you are covered by a Company tax equalization policy, you also

agrees to pay to the Company any additional hypothetical tax obligation calculated and paid under the terms and conditions of such tax

equalization policy.

5. Nature of Grant. By participating in the Omnibus Plan and in exchange for receiving the Performance Share Award, you acknowledge,

understand and agree that:

(a)

the Omnibus Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,

suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Omnibus Plan;

(b)

the grant of the Performance Share Award is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other

right  to  receive  future  grants  of  Performance  Share  Awards,  or  benefits  in  lieu  of  Performance  Share  Awards,  even  if

Performance Share Awards have been granted in the past;

(c)

all  decisions  with  respect  to  future  Performance  Share  Award  grants,  if  any,  shall  be  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Board  of

(d)

(e)

Directors of the Company or the Committee;

the Participant is voluntarily participating in the Omnibus Plan;

the  Performance  Share  Award  and  any  Shares  subject  to  the  Performance  Share  Award  are  not  part  of  or  included  in  any

calculation  of  severance,  resignation,  termination,  redundancy,  dismissal,  end  of  service  payments,  bonuses,  long-service

awards, pension, retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for,

or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer, or any Affiliate;

(f)

the Performance Share Award grant shall not be interpreted to form or amend an employment or service contract or relationship

with the Company or any Affiliate;

(g)

(h)

the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;

the  Performance  Share  Award  and  the  benefits  evidenced  by  this  Agreement  do  not  create  any  entitlement,  not  otherwise

specifically  determined  by  the  Company  in  its  discretion,  to  have  the  Performance  Share  Award  or  any  such  benefits

transferred  to,  or  assumed  by,  another  company,  or  to  be  exchanged,  cashed  out  or  substituted  for,  in  connection  with  any

corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and

If you reside outside the U.S., the following additional provisions shall apply:

(i)

(j)

the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award, and the income from and value of same,

are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

the  Performance  Share  Award  and  the  Shares  subject  to  the  Performance  Share  Award  are  extraordinary  items  that  do  not

constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or the Employer, and are outside the

scope of your employment or service contract, if any;

(k)

the Performance Share Award and the Shares subject to the Performance Share Award are not part of normal compensation or

salary from the Employer and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for

the Company, the Employer or any Affiliate of the Company;

(l)

no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Share Award resulting from

failure  to  reach  Performance  Goals  or  termination  of  your  employment  by  the  Company  or  the  Employer  (for  any  reason

whatsoever and whether or not in breach of any employment laws in the country where you reside or later found to be invalid),

and  in  consideration  of  the  grant  of  the  Performance  Share  Award  to  which  you  are  otherwise  not  entitled,  you  irrevocably

agree never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer, waive your ability, if any, to

bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any

such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Omnibus Plan, you shall be deemed

irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal

or withdrawal of such claims; and

(m)

neither  the  Company,  the  Employer  nor  any  Affiliate  shall  be  liable  for  any  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuation  between  your

local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance Share Award, any Shares paid to you

or any proceeds resulting from your sale of such Shares.

6. Data  Privacy.  By  participating  in  the  Omnibus  Plan  and  in  exchange  for  receiving  the  Performance  Share  Award,  you  hereby

explicitly  and  unambiguously  consent  to  the  collection,  use  and  transfer,  in  electronic  or  other  form,  of  your  personal  data  as

described in this Agreement and any other Performance Share Award grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer,

the  Company  and  its  Affiliates  for  the  exclusive  purpose  of  implementing,  administering  and  managing  your  receipt  of  the

Performance Share Award.

You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited

to, your name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification

number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Performance Share

Awards  or  any  other  entitlement  to  Shares  of  stock  or  equivalent  benefits  awarded,  canceled,  exercised,  vested,  unvested  or

outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in

the Omnibus Plan.

You understand that Data will be transferred to UBS Financial Services (“UBS”), or such other stock plan service provider as may

be  selected  by  the  Company  in  the  future,  which  is  assisting  the  Company  with  the  implementation,  administration  and

management of the Performance Share Award. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States

or elsewhere, and that the recipients' country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than

your country. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of

any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, UBS and

any  other  possible  recipients  which  may  assist  the  Company  (presently  or  in  the  future)  with  implementing,  administering  and

managing the Performance Share Award to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the

sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Performance Share Award. You  understand

that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your receipt of the Performance Share

Award. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information

about the storage and processing of Data, require any

necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your

local human resources representative. You understand, that refusal or withdrawal of consent may affect your ability to participate in

the Omnibus Plan. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis.  If you do not

consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or Service will not be affected; the only consequence of

refusing  or  withdrawing  your  consent  is  that  the  Company  would  not  be  able  to  grant  the  Performance  Share  Award  or  other

Awards to you or administer or maintain such Awards. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or

withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

Upon  request  of  the  Company  or  the  Employer,  you  agree  to  provide  an  executed  data  privacy  consent  form  (or  any  other

agreements or consents that may be required by the Company and/or the Employer) that the Company and/or the Employer may

deem necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the Omnibus Plan in compliance with the

data privacy laws in your country of residence (or employment, if different), either now or in the future. You understand and agree

that you will be unable to participate in the Omnibus Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the

Company and/or the Employer.

7. Nontransferability of Performance Share Award. The Performance Share Award or the interests or rights therein may not be transferred

in  any  manner  other  than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution,  and  may  not  be  assigned,  hypothecated  or  otherwise

pledged and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon

the levy of any such process, in violation of the provisions herein, the Performance Share Award shall immediately become null and

void and any rights to receive a payment under the Performance Share Award shall be forfeited.

8. Rights  as  Shareholder.  Neither  you  nor  any  person  claiming  under  or  through  you  shall  have  any  of  the  rights  or  privileges  of  a

shareholder of the Company in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which

may be in uncertificated form) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or

registrars,  and  delivered  to  you  (including  through  electronic  delivery  to  a  brokerage  account).  After  such  issuance,  recordation  and

delivery, you shall have all the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the Shares and the

right to receive any cash or Share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.

9. Repayment/Forfeiture.  The  Award  shall  be  canceled  and  forfeited,  if,  without  the  consent  of  the  Company,  while  employed  by  or

providing  services  to  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  or  after  termination  of  such  employment  or  service,  you  (i)  violate  a  non-

competition,  non-solicitation  or  non-disclosure  covenant  or  agreement,  (ii)  otherwise  engage  in  activity  that  is  in  conflict  with  or

adverse  to  the  interest  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary,  including  fraud  or  conduct  contributing  to  any  financial  restatements  or

irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In addition, any payments or benefits you may receive

hereunder shall be subject to repayment or forfeiture as may be required to comply with the requirements under the Securities Act, the

Act,  rules  promulgated  by  the  Commission  or  any  other  applicable  law,  including  the  requirements  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street

Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any securities exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded, as may be in effect from

time to time as well as any policy relating to the repayment or forfeiture of compensation that the Company may adopt from time-to-

time. Further, if you receive any amount in excess of what you should have received under the terms of the Performance Share Award

for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations or administrative error), all as

determined by the Committee, then you shall be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to the Company. Nothing in or

about this Agreement prohibits you from: (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F of the Act, maintaining the confidentiality of

a  claim  with  the  Commission,  (ii)  providing  the  Commission  with  information  that  would  otherwise  violate  the  non-disclosure

restrictions  in  this  Agreement,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  Section  21F  of  the  Act;  (iii)  cooperating,  participating  or  assisting  in  a

Commission investigation or proceeding without notifying the Company; or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F

of the Act. Furthermore, you are advised that you shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law

for the disclosure of any Confidential Information (as defined in Exhibit B) that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend Trade

Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either

directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or

(ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such filings are made under seal.

10. Restrictions on Resale. You  hereby  agree  not  to  sell  any  Shares  issued  in  payment  of  the  Performance  Share  Award  at  a  time  when

applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply as long as your employment continues and for such

period of time after the termination of your employment as the Company may specify.

11. Language. If you have received this Agreement or any other document related to the Omnibus Plan translated into a language other

than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.

12. Effect  of  a  Change  in  Control.  The  treatment  of  a  Performance  Share  Award  upon  a  Change  in  Control  shall  be  governed  by  the

Omnibus Plan, provided, however, that to the extent that the Performance Share Award constitute Deferred Compensation, settlement

of any portion of the Performance Share Award that may vest in connection with a Change in Control will occur within sixty (60) days

following the Vesting Date. In the event that there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement regarding the effect of a Change in

Control on the Performance Share Award and the terms of any Employment Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will govern.

13. Securities  Laws  and  Clawback.  By  accepting  a  Performance  Share  Award,  you  acknowledge  that  U.S.  federal,  state  or  foreign

securities laws and/or the Company’s policies regarding trading in its securities may limit or restrict your right to buy or sell Shares,

including, without limitation, sales of Shares acquired in connection

with the Performance Share Award. You agree to comply with such securities law requirements and Company policies, as such laws

and policies are amended from time to time. You also acknowledge that the Performance Share Award may be forfeited if you engage

in activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interest of the Company or any Subsidiary, including fraud or conduct contributing to

any financial restatements or irregularities, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or to the extent that you otherwise

violate any policy adopted by the Company relating to the recovery of compensation granted, paid, delivered, awarded or otherwise

provided to you by the Company as such policy is in effect on the date of grant of the applicable Award or, to the extent necessary to

address the requirements of applicable law (including Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

of 2010, as codified in Section 10D of the Act, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other applicable law), as may be

amended from time to time.

14. Adjustments. The Performance Goals, as well as the manner in which the Performance Share Award payment is calculated is subject to

adjustment  in  the  Committee’s  sole  discretion  in  accordance  with  Section  10(b)  of  the  Omnibus  Plan  and  the  Notice.  You  shall  be

notified of such adjustment and such adjustment shall be binding upon the Company and you.

15. NO  GUARANTEE  OF  CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT. YOU  HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND  AGREE  THAT  THE  VESTING

OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT IS EARNED ONLY IF

THE  PERFORMANCE  GOALS  ARE  ATTAINED  AND  THE  OTHER  TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  SET  FORTH  HEREIN  ARE

SATISFIED AND BY YOUR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT (SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3(b) HEREOF) AT

THE  WILL  OF  THE  COMPANY  OR  AN  AFFILIATE  (AND  NOT  THROUGH  THE  ACT  OF  BEING  EMPLOYED  BY  THE

COMPANY  OR  AN  AFFILIATE,  BEING  GRANTED  A  PERFORMANCE  SHARE  AWARD,  OR  RECEIVING  SHARES

HEREUNDER).  YOU  FURTHER  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND  AGREE  THAT  THIS  AGREEMENT,  THE  TRANSACTIONS

CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE RIGHT TO EARN A PAYMENT UNDER THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD

SET  FORTH  HEREIN  DO  NOT  CONSTITUTE  AN  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED  PROMISE  OF  CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT

DURING  THE  PERFORMANCE  PERIOD,  FOR  ANY  PERIOD,  OR  AT  ALL,  AND  SHALL  NOT  INTERFERE  WITH  YOUR

RIGHT  OR  THE  RIGHT  OF  THE  COMPANY  OR  AN  AFFILIATE  TO  TERMINATE  YOUR  EMPLOYMENT  AT  ANY  TIME,

WITH  OR  WITHOUT  CAUSE,  AND  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  APPLICABLE  EMPLOYMENT  LAWS  OF  THE  COUNTRY

WHERE YOU RESIDE.

agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements

of  the  Company  and  you  with  respect  to  the  subject  matter  hereof,  and  may  not  be  modified  adversely  to  your  interest  except  as

any persons other than the parties. The Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement are to be

the parties. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice, the Omnibus Plan or this Agreement, you are deemed to submit to the exclusive

jurisdiction of Delaware, U.S.A., and agree that such litigation shall be conducted in the courts of Wilmington County, Delaware, or the

federal courts for the United States for the Eastern District of Delaware, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.

Plan and this Agreement shall be administered, and the Performance Share Award is granted, only in such a manner as to conform to

such laws, rules and regulations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Notice, the Omnibus Plan and this Agreement shall be

deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.

Plan and this Agreement shall be submitted by you or by the Company to the Committee. The resolution of such question or dispute by

the Committee shall be final and binding on all persons.

19. Headings. The  captions  used  in  the  Notice  and  this  Agreement  are  inserted  for  convenience  and  shall  not  be  deemed  a  part  of  the

address as shown in these instruments, or to such other address as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the other

part.

21. Successors  and  Assigns. The  Company  may  assign  any  of  its  rights  under  this  Agreement  to  single  or  multiple  assignees,  and  this

forth, this Agreement shall be binding upon you and your heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assign.

22. Severability.  Whenever  feasible,  each  provision  of  the  Notice,  this  Agreement,  and  the  Omnibus  Plan  shall  be  interpreted  in  such

manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision in the Notice, Omnibus Plan or this Agreement is held to

be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,

without invalidating the remainder of the Notice, the Omnibus Plan or this Agreement.

23. Waiver.  You  acknowledge  that  a  waiver  by  the  Company  for  breach  of  any  provision  of  the  Agreement  shall  not  operate  or  be

construed as a waiver of any other provision of the Award Agreement, or of any subsequent breach of the Agreement.

24. Code Section 409A. This Performance Share Award is intended to be exempt from or to comply with Section 409A of the Code and

shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with such intent. To the extent this Agreement provides for the

Performance  Share  Award  to  become  vested  and  be  settled  upon  your  termination  of  employment,  the  applicable  Shares  shall  be

transferred to you or your beneficiary upon your “separation from service,” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; provided

that  if  you  are  a  “specified  employee,”  within  the  meaning  of  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  then  to  the  extent  the  Performance  Share

Award  constitutes  nonqualified  deferred  compensation,  within  the  meaning  of  Section  409A  of  the  Code,  such  Shares  shall  be

transferred to you or your beneficiary upon the earlier to occur of (i) the six-month anniversary of such separation from service and (ii)

the date of your death.

This Agreement may be amended at any time, without the consent of any party, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code in

a particular circumstance or that is necessary or desirable to satisfy any of the requirements under Section 409A of the Code, but the

Company  shall  not  be  under  any  obligation  to  make  any  such  amendment.  Nothing  in  the  Agreement  shall  provide  a  basis  for  any

person to take action against the Company or any Affiliate based on matters covered by Section 409A of the Code, including the tax

treatment of any amount paid under the Performance Share Award granted hereunder, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates

shall  under  any  circumstances  have  any  liability  to  you  or  your  estate  or  any  other  party  for  any  taxes,  penalties  or  interest  due  on

amounts paid or payable under this Agreement, including taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Section 409A of the Code.

25. No Advice Regarding Performance Share Award. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company

making any recommendations regarding your acquisition or sale of any Shares issued in payment of the Performance Share Award. You

acknowledge that you should consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors before taking any action related to the

Performance Share Award.

26. Language. If you have received this Agreement or any other document related to the Omnibus Plan translated into a language other

than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version shall control.

27. Appendix I. Notwithstanding  any  provisions  in  this  Agreement,  the  Performance  Share  Award  grant  shall  be  subject  to  any  special

terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  Appendix  I  to  this  Agreement  for  your  country.  Moreover,  if  you  relocate  to  one  of  the  countries

included in Appendix I, the special terms and conditions for such country shall apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that

the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with laws in the country where you reside

regarding the issuance of Shares, or to facilitate the administration of the Performance Share Award. Appendix I constitutes part of this

Agreement.

28. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or

future  Performance  Share  Awards  by  electronic  means  or  to  request  your  consent  to  participate  in  the  Omnibus  Plan  by  electronic

on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

29. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Omnibus

Plan  or  on  the  Performance  Share  Award  and  on  any  Shares  issued  in  payment  of  the  Performance  Share  Award,  to  the  extent  the

Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with laws in the country where you reside regarding the issuance

of Shares, or to facilitate the administration of the Performance Share Award, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or

EXHIBIT B

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AGREEMENT

I understand that I am or will be an employee to or other service-provider of The Kraft Heinz Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or

its  Affiliates  (collectively  the  "Company"),  and  will  learn  and  have  access  to  the  Company's  confidential,  trade  secret  and  proprietary

information and key business relationships. I understand that the products and services that the Company develops, provides and markets are

unique. Further, I know that my promises in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement (the "Agreement") are an important way for the Company to

protect its proprietary interests and that The Kraft Heinz Company would not have granted me Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) or other

equity grants unless I made such promises.

In  addition  to  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  I  am  expressly  being  given  PSUs  or  other  equity  grants  in  exchange  for  my

agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, I (the "Executive") agree as follows:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. During the course of Executive's Service, Executive will have access to

Confidential  Information.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Confidential  Information"  means  all  data,  information,  ideas,  concepts,

discoveries,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable  or  reduced  to  practice),  innovations,  improvements,  know-how,

developments, techniques, methods, processes, treatments, drawings, sketches, specifications, designs, plans, patterns, models, plans and

strategies,  and  all  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information  or  trade  secrets  in  any  form  or  medium  (whether  merely  remembered  or

embodied in a tangible or intangible form or medium) whether now or hereafter existing, relating to or arising from the past, current or

potential  business,  activities  and/or  operations  of  the  Company,  including,  without  limitation,  any  such  information  relating  to  or

concerning finances, sales, marketing, advertising, transition, promotions, pricing, personnel, customers, suppliers, vendors, raw partners

and/or competitors of the Company. Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or

otherwise communicate to any person, other than in the course of Executive's assigned duties and for the benefit of the Company, either

during  the  period  of  Executive's  Service  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  any  Confidential  Information  or  other  confidential  or  proprietary

information received from third parties subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such information, and to

use  such  information  only  for  certain  limited  purposes,  in  each  case,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  Executive  during  Executive's

Service. The  foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  information  that  (i)  was  known  to  the  public  prior  to  its  disclosure  to  Executive;  (ii)  becomes

generally  known  to  the  public  subsequent  to  disclosure  to  Executive  through  no  wrongful  act  of  Executive  or  any  representative  of

Executive; or (iii) Executive is required to disclose by applicable law, regulation or legal process (provided that, to the extent permitted by

law, Executive provides the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and cooperates with the Company at its expense in

seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).

Pursuant to the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall not be held criminally, or civilly, liable under any Federal or State

Trade  secret  law  for  the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  that  is  made  in  confidence  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  a  Federal,  State,  or  local

government official, or an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting, or investigating, a violation of law. Moreover, Executive may disclose

trade  secrets  in  a  complaint,  or  other  document,  filed  in  a  lawsuit,  or  other  proceeding,  if  such  filing  is  made  under  seal.  Finally,  if

Executive files a lawsuit alleging retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of the law, Executive may disclose the

trade secret to Executive's attorney and use the trade secret in the court proceeding, if Executive files any document containing the trade

secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

No  Company  policies  or  practices,  including  this  Non-Disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  provision,  is  intended  to  or  shall  limit,

prevent,  impede  or  interfere  in  any  way  with  Executive's  right,  without  prior  notice  to  the  Company,  to  provide  information  to  the

government, participate in investigations, testify in proceedings regarding the Company's past or future conduct, or engage in any activities

protected under whistle blower statutes.

2. NON-COMPETITION.  Executive  acknowledges  that  (i)  Executive  performs  services  of  a  unique  nature  for  the  Company  that  are

irreplaceable, and that Executive's performance of such services to a competing business will result in irreparable harm to the Company, (ii)

Executive  has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  Confidential  Information  which,  if  disclosed,  would  unfairly  and  inappropriately

assist in competition against the Company, (iii) in the course of Executive's employment by or service to a competitor, Executive would

inevitably use or disclose such Confidential Information, (iv) the Company has substantial relationships with its customers and Executive

has  had  and  will  continue  to  have  access  to  these  customers,  (v)  Executive  has  received  and  will  receive  specialized  training  from  the

Company, and (vi) Executive has generated and will continue to generate goodwill for the Company in the course of Executive's Service.

Accordingly, during Executive's Service and for eighteen (18) months following a termination of Executive's Service for any reason (the

"Restricted  Period"),  Executive  will  not  engage  in  any  business  activities,  directly  or  indirectly  (whether  as  an  employee,  consultant,

officer, director, partner, joint venturer, manager, member, principal, agent, or independent contractor, individually, in concert with others,

or in any other manner) within the same line or lines of business for which the Executive performed services for the Company and in a

capacity that is similar to the capacity in which the Executive was employed by the Company with any person or entity that competes with

the  Company  in  the  consumer  packaged  food  and  beverage  industry  ("Competitive  Business")  anywhere  within  the  same  geographic

territory(ies) for which the Executive performed services for the Company (the "Restricted Territory"). Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,

nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a passive owner of not more than three percent (3%)

of the equity securities of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a business that is in competition with the Company, so long as Executive

has no active participation in the business of such corporation.

3. NON-SOLICITATION. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's

duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, solicit, aid,

induce, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any business (other than on behalf of the Company) from, any customer or potential customer

of the Company to purchase goods or services then sold by the Company from another person, firm, corporation or other entity or, directly

or indirectly, in any way request, suggest or advise any such customer to withdraw or cancel any of their business or refuse to continue to

do business with the Company. This restriction shall apply to customers or potential customers who, during the two (2) years immediately

preceding the Executive's termination, had been assigned to the Executive by the Company, or with which the Executive had contact on

behalf of the Company while an Executive of the Company, or about which the Executive had access to confidential information by virtue

of Executive's employment with the Company.

4. NON-INTERFERENCE. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, except in the furtherance of Executive's

duties to the Company, directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, (A) solicit, aid

or induce any employee, representative or agent of the Company to leave such employment or retention or to accept employment with or

render  services  to  or  with  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  unaffiliated  with  the  Company  or  hire  or  retain  any  such

employee,  representative  or  agent,  or  take  any  action  to  materially  assist  or  aid  any  other  person,  firm,  corporation  or  other  entity  in

identifying, hiring or soliciting any such employee, representative or agent, or (B) interfere, or aid or induce any other person or entity in

interfering, with the relationship between the Company and its vendors, suppliers or customers. As used herein, the term "solicit, aid or

induce"  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  (i)  initiating  communications  with  a  Company  employee  relating  to  possible  employment,  (ii)

offering  bonuses  or  other  compensation  to  encourage  a  Company  employee  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  with  the  Company  and

accept employment with any entity, (iii) recommending a Company employee to any entity, and (iv) aiding an entity in recruitment of a

Company employee. An employee, representative or agent shall be deemed covered by this Section 4 while so employed or retained and for

a period of six (6) months thereafter.

5. NON-DISPARAGEMENT.  Executive  agrees  not  to  make  negative  comments  or  otherwise  disparage  the  Company  or  its  officers,

directors, employees, shareholders, agents or products or services. The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements made in (a)

response  to  legal  process,  required  governmental  testimony  or  filings,  or  administrative  or  arbitral  proceedings  (including,  without

limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings) or (b) the good faith performance of Executive's duties to the Company.

6.

INVENTIONS.

a. Executive acknowledges and agrees that all ideas, methods, inventions, discoveries, improvements, work products, developments,

software,  know-how,  processes,  techniques,  methods,  works  of  authorship  and  other  work  product  ("Inventions"),  whether

patentable  or  unpatentable,  (A)  that  are  reduced  to  practice,  created,  invented,  designed,  developed,  contributed  to,  or  improved

with  the  use  of  any  Company  resources  and/or  within  the  scope  of  Executive's  work  with  the  Company  or  that  relate  to  the

business,  operations  or  actual  or  demonstrably  anticipated  research  or  development  of  the  Company,  and  that  are  made  or

conceived  by  Executive,  solely  or  jointly  with  others,  during  Executive's  Service,  or  (B)  suggested  by  any  work  that  Executive

performs in connection with the Company, either while performing Executive's duties with the Company or on Executive's own

time, but only insofar as the Inventions are related to Executive's work as an employee or other service provider to the Company,

shall  belong  exclusively  to  the  Company  (or  its  designee),  whether  or  not  patent  or  other  applications  for  intellectual  property

protection are filed thereon. Executive will keep full and complete written records (the "Records"), in the manner prescribed by the

Company, of all Inventions, and will promptly disclose all Inventions completely and in writing to the Company. The Records shall

be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and Executive will surrender them upon the termination of Service, or upon the

Company's request. Executive irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company the Inventions and all patents or other

intellectual property rights that may issue thereon in any and all countries, whether during or subsequent to Executive's Service,

together with the right to file, in Executive's name or in the name of the Company (or its designee), applications for patents and

equivalent  rights  (the  "Applications").  Executive  will,  at  any  time  during  and  subsequent  to  Executive's  Service,  make  such

applications,  sign  such  papers,  take  all  rightful  oaths,  and  perform  all  other  acts  as  may  be  requested  from  time  to  time  by  the

Company  to  perfect,  record,  enforce,  protect,  patent  or  register  the  Company's  rights  in  the  Inventions,  all  without  additional

compensation to Executive from the Company. Executive will also execute assignments to the Company (or its designee) of the

Applications, and give the Company and its attorneys all reasonable assistance (including the giving of testimony) to obtain the

Inventions  for  the  Company's  benefit,  all  without  additional  compensation  to  Executive  from  the  Company,  but  entirely  at  the

Company's expense.

b.

In addition, the Inventions will be deemed Work for Hire, as such term is defined under the copyright laws of the United States, on

behalf of the Company and Executive agrees that the Company will be the sole owner of the Inventions, and all underlying rights

therein, in all media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity without any further obligations to

Executive. If the Inventions, or any portion thereof, are deemed not to be Work for Hire, or the rights in such Inventions do not

otherwise

automatically vest in the Company, Executive hereby irrevocably conveys, transfers and assigns to the Company, all rights, in all

media now known or hereinafter devised, throughout the universe and in perpetuity, in and to the Inventions, including, without

limitation,  all  of  Executive's  right,  title  and  interest  in  the  copyrights  (and  all  renewals,  revivals  and  extensions  thereof)  to  the

Inventions,  including,  without  limitation,  all  rights  of  any  kind  or  any  nature  now  or  hereafter  recognized,  including,  without

limitation, the unrestricted right to make modifications, adaptations and revisions to the Inventions, to exploit and allow others to

exploit  the  Inventions  and  all  rights  to  sue  at  law  or  in  equity  for  any  infringement,  or  other  unauthorized  use  or  conduct  in

derogation  of  the  Inventions,  known  or  unknown,  prior  to  the  date  hereof,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to  receive  all

proceeds and damages therefrom. In addition, Executive hereby waives any so-called "moral rights" with respect to the Inventions.

To  the  extent  that  Executive  has  any  rights  in  the  results  and  proceeds  of  Executive's  service  to  the  Company  that  cannot  be

assigned  in  the  manner  described  herein,  Executive  agrees  to  unconditionally  waive  the  enforcement  of  such  rights.  Executive

hereby  waives  any  and  all  currently  existing  and  future  monetary  rights  in  and  to  the  Inventions  and  all  patents  and  other

registrations for intellectual property that may issue thereon, including, without limitation, any rights that would otherwise accrue

to Executive's benefit by virtue of Executive being an employee of or other service provider to the Company.

7. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY. On the date of Executive's termination of Service with the Company for any reason (or at any

time prior thereto at the Company's request), Executive shall return all property belonging to the Company (including, but not limited to,

any Company-provided laptops, computers, cell phones, wireless electronic mail devices or other equipment, or documents and property

belonging to the Company).

8. REASONABLENESS  OF  COVENANTS.  In  signing  this  Agreement,  including  by  electronic  means,  Executive  gives  the  Company

assurance  that  Executive  has  carefully  read  and  considered  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,  including  the  restraints

imposed  by  it.  Executive  agrees  that  these  restraints  are  necessary  for  the  reasonable  and  proper  protection  of  the  Company  and  its

Confidential  Information  and  that  each  and  every  one  of  the  restraints  is  reasonable  in  respect  to  subject  matter,  length  of  time  and

geographic  area,  and  that  these  restraints,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  will  not  prevent  Executive  from  obtaining  other  suitable

employment during the period in which Executive is bound by the restraints. Executive acknowledges that each of these covenants has a

unique, very substantial and immeasurable value to the Company and that Executive has sufficient assets and skills to provide a livelihood

while such covenants remain in force. Executive further covenants that Executive will not challenge the reasonableness or enforceability of

any  of  the  covenants  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,  and  that  Executive  will  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  costs  (including  reasonable

attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any action to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement if either the Company prevails on

any material issue involved in such dispute or if Executive challenges the reasonableness or enforceability of any of the provisions of this

Agreement. It is also agreed that the "Company" as used in this Agreement refers to each of the

Company's Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that each of the Company's s Subsidiaries and Affiliates will have the right to enforce all

of Executive's obligations to that Subsidiary or Affiliate under this Agreement, as applicable, subject to any limitation or restriction

on such rights of the Subsidiary or Affiliate under applicable law.

9. REFORMATION. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state or country that any restriction in this Agreement is

excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction

may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of that state or country.

10. REMEDIES.  Executive  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Company's  remedies  at  law  for  a  breach  or  threatened  breach  of  any  of  the

provisions  of  Agreement  would  be  inadequate  and,  in  recognition  of  this  fact,  Executive  agrees  that,  in  the  event  of  such  a  breach  or

threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond or other security, shall be entitled to obtain

equitable  relief  in  the  form  of  specific  performance,  a  temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  or  permanent  injunction  or  any  other

equitable  remedy  which  may  then  be  available,  without  the  necessity  of  showing  actual  monetary  damages,  in  addition  to  any  other

equitable relief (including without limitation an accounting and/or disgorgement) and/or any other damages as a matter of law.

11. REPURCHASE. Executive acknowledges and agrees that a breach of this Agreement would constitute a "Covenant Breach" as such term

is used in the Omnibus Plan and therefore, in the event of a Covenant Breach, Executive's PSUs and the Shares issued in payment thereof

(as such terms are defined in the Omnibus Plan) shall be subject to repurchase by The Kraft Heinz Company in accordance with the terms

of the Omnibus Plan.

12. TOLLING. In the event of any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that the post-termination

restrictions contained in this Agreement shall be extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation, it being the intention of

the parties hereto that the running of the applicable post-termination restriction period shall be tolled during any period of such violation.

13. SURVIVAL  OF  PROVISIONS.  The  obligations  contained  in  this  Agreement hereof  shall  survive  the  termination  or  expiration  of  the

Executive's Service with the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter.

14. VENUE,  PERSONAL  JURISDICTION,  AND  COVENANT  NOT  TO  SUE.  Executive  expressly  agrees  to  submit  to  the  exclusive

jurisdiction and exclusive venue of courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with any litigation which may be brought with

respect to a dispute between the Company and Executive in relation

to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement, regardless of where Executive resides or where Executive performs services for the Company.

Executive hereby irrevocably waives Executive's rights, if any, to have any disputes between the Company and Executive related to this

Restrictive  Covenants  Agreement  decided  in  any  jurisdiction  or  venue  other  than  a  court  in  the  State  of  Delaware.  Executive  hereby

waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which Executive now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction

or to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and Executive agrees not to plead or claim the same. Executive further

irrevocably covenants not to sue the Company related to this Restrictive Covenants Agreement in any jurisdiction or venue other than a

court  in  the  State  of  Delaware.  All  matters  relating  to  the  interpretation,  construction,  application,  validity,  and  enforcement  of  this

Agreement,  and  any  disputes  or  controversies  arising  hereunder,  will  be  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware  without  giving

effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the

application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

APPENDIX I

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THE KRAFT HEINZ COMPANY
OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT FOR NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Appendix I includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance Share Award (referred to herein as PSUs) granted to you
under the Omnibus Plan if you work or reside outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. These terms and conditions are in
addition to, or if so indicated, in place of the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Appendix I have the meanings set forth in the Omnibus Plan and/or the Agreement.

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transfer employment and/or residency to
another  country  after  the  PSUs  are  granted  to  you,  or  are  considered  a  resident  of  another  country  for  local  law  purposes,  the  terms  and
conditions  contained  herein  may  not  be  applicable  to  you,  and  the  Company  shall,  in  its  discretion,  determine  to  what  extent  the  terms  and
conditions contained herein shall apply to you.

NOTIFICATIONS

This Appendix I also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to
participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan.  The  information  is  based  on  the  securities,  exchange  control,  and  other  laws  in  effect  in  the  respective
countries as of February 2018. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not
rely on the information in this Appendix I as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Omnibus
Plan because the information may be out of date at the time you vest in the PSUs or sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan.

In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a
position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your
country may apply to your situation.

Finally,  if  you  are  a  citizen  or  resident  of  a  country  other  than  the  one  in  which  you  are  currently  working,  transfer  employment  and/or
residency after the PSUs are granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications contained herein
may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

GENERAL NON-U.S. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following terms and conditions apply to you if you are located outside of the U.S.

Entire Agreement.
The following provisions supplement the entire Agreement, generally:

If you are located outside the U.S., in no event will any aspect of the PSUs be determined in accordance with your Employment Agreement (or
other Service contract). The terms and conditions of the PSUs will be solely determined in accordance with the provisions of the Omnibus Plan
and  the  Agreement,  including  this  Appendix  I,  which  supersede  and  replace  any  prior  agreement,  either  written  or  verbal  (including  your
Employment Agreement, if applicable) in relation to the PSUs.

Performance Share Award Payment.
If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, the Company may, in its sole discretion, settle the PSUs in the form of a cash
payment to the extent settlement in Shares: (i) is prohibited under local law, (ii) would require you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  to  obtain  the  approval  of  any  governmental  or  regulatory  body  in  your  country  of  residence  (or  your  country  of  employment,  if
different), (iii) would result in adverse tax consequences for you, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or (iv) is administratively
burdensome. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion settle the PSUs in the form of Shares but require you to sell such Shares
immediately  or  within  a  specified  period  following  your  termination  of  Service  (in  which  case,  this  Agreement  shall  give  the  Company  the
authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).

Termination Without Cause, death and Disability / Payout Upon Termination.
The following provisions supplement the termination provisions of the Award Notice and Agreement, provided, however, that if you are subject
to U.S. federal income tax and the PSUs constitute Deferred Compensation, your termination of Service date will be the date of your Separation
from Service:

For  purposes  of  the  PSU,  your  employment  or  Service  relationship  will  be  considered  terminated  as  of  the  date  you  are  no  longer  actively
providing Services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not
later  found  to  be  invalid  or  in  breach  of  employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment
Agreement, if any), and unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or determined by the Company, your right to vest in the PSU
under the Omnibus Plan, if any, will terminate as of such date and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of Service would
not include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where  you  provide  Service  or  the  terms  of  your  Employment  Agreement,  if  any);  the  Committee  shall  have  the  exclusive  discretion  to
determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs (including whether you may still be considered to be
providing Service while on a leave of absence).

Notwithstanding the provisions governing the treatment of the PSUs upon termination due to Retirement as set forth in the Award Notice and
Agreement,  if  the  Company  receives  an  opinion  of  counsel  that  there  has  been  a  legal  judgment  and/or  legal  development  in  a  particular
jurisdiction  that  would  likely  result  in  the  treatment  in  case  of  a  termination  due  to  Retirement  as  set  forth  in  the  Agreement  being  deemed
unlawful  and/or  discriminatory,  then  the  Company  will  not  apply  the  provisions  for  termination  due  to  Retirement  at  the  time  you  cease  to
provide Service and the PSUs will be treated as it would under the rules that apply if your Service ends for resignation.

Termination for Cause.
The implications upon a termination for Cause as set forth in the Agreement and Omnibus Plan shall only be enforced, to the extent deemed
permissible under applicable local law, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

Not a Public Offering in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions.

If you are resident or employed outside of the United States, neither the grant of the PSUs under the Omnibus Plan nor the issuance of the
underlying  Shares  upon  vesting  of  the  PSUs  is  intended  to  be  a  public  offering  of  securities  in  your  country  of  residence  (and  country  of
employment,  if  different).  The  Company  has  not  submitted  any  registration  statement,  prospectus  or  other  filings  to  the  local  securities
authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States unless otherwise required under local law.

Insider Trading and Market Abuse Laws.
You  may  be  subject  to  insider  trading  restrictions  and/or  market  abuse  laws  based  on  the  exchange  on  which  the  Shares  are  listed  and  in
applicable  jurisdictions  including  the  United  States  and  your  country  or  your  broker's  country,  if  different,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to
accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares or rights linked to the value of Shares under the Omnibus Plan during such
times as you are considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local
insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third party and (b) "tipping" third parties or causing
them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate
from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is
your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

Foreign Asset/Account, Exchange Control and Tax Reporting.
You may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or
transfer  of  Shares  or  cash  (including  dividends,  dividend  equivalents  and  the  proceeds  arising  from  the  sale  of  Shares)  derived  from  your
participation in the Omnibus Plan, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of
your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to
the  applicable  authorities  in  such  country.  You  acknowledge  that  you  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  any  applicable  foreign
asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting requirements and should consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS/NOTIFICATIONS

AUSTRALIA

NOTIFICATIONS

Offer Document.
This offer document sets out information regarding the grant of PSUs to Australian resident employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  and  is  provided  by  the  Company  to  ensure  compliance  of  the  Omnibus  Plan  with  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments
Commission's ("ASIC's") Class Order 14/1000 and relevant provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.

In addition to the information set out in the Agreement, you also are being provided with a copy of the Omnibus Plan, the prospectus and the
employee information supplement (collectively, the "Additional Documents").

The Additional Documents provide further information to help you make an informed investment decision about participating in the Omnibus
Plan. The Omnibus Plan is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001.

You  should  not  rely  upon  any  oral  statements  made  in  relation  to  this  offer.  You  should  rely  only  upon  the  statements  contained  in  the
Agreement and the Additional Documents when considering participation in the Omnibus Plan.

Securities Law Notification
Investment  in  Shares  involves  a  degree  of  risk.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  the  Omnibus  Plan,  you  should  monitor  your  participation  and
consider  all  risk  factors  relevant  to  the  acquisition  of  Shares  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  as  set  out  in  the  Agreement  and  the  Additional
Documents.

The  information  contained  in  this  offer  is  general  information  only.  It  is  not  advice  or  information  that  takes  into  account  your  objectives,
financial situation and needs.

You should consider obtaining your own financial product advice from an independent person who is licensed by ASIC to give advice about
participation in the Omnibus Plan.

Additional Risk Factors for Australian Residents
You should have regard to risk factors relevant to investment in securities generally and, in particular, to the holding of Shares. For example,
the price at which Shares are quoted on the Nasdaq may increase or decrease due to a number of factors. There is no guarantee that the price of
the Shares will increase. Factors which may affect the price of Shares include fluctuations in the domestic and international market for listed
stocks, general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, commodity and oil prices, changes to government fiscal, monetary
or regulatory policies, legislation or regulation, the nature of the markets in which the Company operates and general operational and business
risks.

More  information  about  potential  factors  that  could  affect  the  Company's  business  and  financial  results  is  included  in  the  Company's  most
recent  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  the  Company's  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q.  Copies  of  these  reports  are  available  at
http://www.sec.gov/, on the Company's "Investor Relations" page at http://ir.kraftheinzcompany.com/, and upon request to the Company.

In addition, you should be aware that the Australian dollar value of any Shares acquired at vesting will be affected by the U.S. dollar/Australian
dollar exchange rate. Participation in the Omnibus Plan involves certain risks related to fluctuations in this rate of exchange.

Common Stock
Common stock of a U.S. corporation is analogous to ordinary shares of an Australian corporation.

Dividends may be paid on the Shares out of any funds of the Company legally available for dividends at the discretion of the Board.

The Shares are traded on the Nasdaq in the United States of America under the symbol "KHC."

The  Shares  are  not  liable  to  any  further  calls  for  payment  of  capital  or  for  other  assessment  by  the  Company  and  have  no  sinking  fund
provisions, pre-emptive rights, conversion rights or redemption provisions.

Ascertaining the Market Price of Shares
You may ascertain the current market price of the Shares as traded on the Nasdaq at http://www.Nasdaq.com under the symbol "KHC." The
Australian dollar equivalent of that price can be obtained at: http://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/frequency/exchange-rates.html.

This will not be a prediction of what the market price per Share will be when the PSUs vest or when the Shares are issued or of the applicable
exchange rate on the actual Vesting Date or date the Shares are issued.

Deferred Taxation.
Subdivision  83A-C  of  the  Income  Tax  Assessment  Act,  1997,  applies  to  PSUs  granted  under  the  Omnibus  Plan,  such  that  the  PSUs  are
intended to be subject to deferred taxation.

BRAZIL

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Compliance with Law.
By accepting the PSUs you acknowledge that you agree to comply with applicable Brazilian laws and pay any and all applicable taxes legally
due by you associated with the vesting of the PSUs, the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalents, and the sale of Shares acquired
or issued under the Omnibus Plan. You further agree that, for all legal purposes, (i) the benefits provided to you under the Omnibus Plan are the
result of commercial transactions unrelated to your employment or Service relationship, (ii) the Omnibus Plan is not a part of the terms and
conditions  of  your  employment  or  Service  relationship,  and  (iii)  the  income  from  the  Award,  if  any,  is  not  part  of  your  remuneration  from
employment or Service.

NOTIFICATIONS

Exchange Control Information.
If you are resident or domiciled in Brazil, you will be required to submit annually a declaration of assets and rights held outside of Brazil to the
Central Bank of Brazil if the aggregate value of such assets and rights is equal to or greater than US$100,000. Assets and rights that must be
reported include Shares.

CANADA

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Plan Document Acknowledgment.
In accepting the grant of PSUs, you acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Omnibus Plan, have reviewed the Omnibus Plan and the
Agreement in their entirety and fully understand and accept all provisions of the Omnibus Plan and the Agreement.

Payout of PSUs in Shares Only.
Pursuant to its discretion under Section 10(d) of the Omnibus Plan, with respect to all employees residing in Canada, the Company will convert
all vested PSUs only into an equivalent number of Shares. If you reside in Canada (or in the event of your death, your legal representative or
estate) you will not receive an equivalent or fractional Share cash

payment with respect to the vested PSUs.

Termination.
The following provision replaces the first paragraph of the Termination section of the General Non-U.S. Terms and Conditions section of this
Appendix I:

In the event of your termination of Service (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where
you provide Service or the terms of your Employment Agreement, if any), unless provided otherwise by the Company: (i) your right to vest in
the PSUs (if any) will terminate effective, as of the earlier of (1) the date the you receive notice of termination, or (2) the date you are no longer
actively  providing  Service,  regardless  of  any  notice  period  or  period  of  pay  in  lieu  of  such  notice  required  under  applicable  Canadian
employment laws (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law).

The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Service for purposes of the PSUs
(including whether you may still be considered to be providing Service while on a leave of absence).

The following terms and conditions apply if you are a resident of Quebec:

Data Privacy.
This provision supplements the Data Privacy section of the Agreement:

You hereby authorize the Company and the Company's representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel,
professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Omnibus Plan. You further authorize the Company and any Subsidiary
or Affiliate and the administrator of the Omnibus Plan to disclose and discuss the Omnibus Plan with their advisors. You further authorize the
Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in your employee file.

Language Consent.
The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Agreement, as well as all documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into,
given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.

Consentement relatif à la langue.
Les parties reconnaissent avoir expressément exigé la rédaction en anglais de la Convention d'Attribution, ainsi que de tous documents, avis et
procédures judiciaires, exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement à, la présente convention.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
You are permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Omnibus Plan, if any,
provided the sale of the Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e.,
Nasdaq).

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Canadian  residents  are  required  to  report  any  specified  foreign  property  (including  Shares  and  PSUs)  on  form  T1135  (Foreign  Income
Verification Statement) if the total cost of such specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time in the year. The form must be filed by
April 30 of the following year. Specified foreign property includes Shares acquired under the Omnibus Plan and may include the PSUs. The
PSUs must be reported - generally at a nil cost - if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign property you hold. If
Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ("ACB") of the Shares. The ACB would normally equal the fair market value
of the Shares at vesting, but if you own other shares, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other

shares. You should speak with a personal tax advisor to determine the scope of foreign property that must be considered for purposes of this
requirement.

CHINA

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The  following  provisions  apply  if  you  are  subject  to  the  exchange  control  regulations  or  restrictions  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China
("China"), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion:

Vesting and Mandatory Sale Restriction.
The following provisions replace the Payment section of the Agreement:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, you agree that the Company may force the sale of
any Shares (i) immediately upon vesting, (ii) following the termination of your Service, (iii) following your transfer to another Subsidiary or
Affiliate outside of China, or (iv) within any other timeframe the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. You agree that you must
maintain  any  Shares  acquired  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  in  an  account  at  a  broker  designated  by  the  Company  ("Designated Account").  All
Shares deposited in the Designated Account cannot be transferred out of that Designated Account. Within six (6) months after the termination
of your Service for any reason (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion), you must sell all Shares acquired
under the Omnibus Plan. The Company will direct the automatic sale of any such Shares remaining in the Designated Account at the expiration
of this six (6) month period (or such other period as determined by the Company in its sole discretion).

You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares (on your behalf
pursuant  to  this  authorization)  and  you  expressly  authorize  the  Company's  designated  broker  to  complete  the  sale  of  such  Shares.  You
acknowledge that the Company's designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the
sale of the Shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any
obligation  to  satisfy  Tax-Related  Items.  You  agree  that  if  you  sell  Shares  that  you  acquire  under  the  Omnibus  Plan,  the  repatriation
requirements described below shall apply.

If you transfer to a Subsidiary or an Affiliate in China or transfer from an Affiliate or Subsidiary in China to another Affiliate outside of China,
you may become or remain subject to the requirements set forth in this Appendix I, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The
Company reserves the right to suspend your participation in the Omnibus Plan or take such other measures as it deems necessary or advisable
to comply with local regulations.

Exchange Control Restriction.
You  understand  and  agree  that,  due  to  exchange  control  laws  in  China,  you  will  be  required  to  immediately  repatriate  to  China  any  cash
proceeds acquired under the Omnibus Plan. You further understand that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be
effected through a special exchange control account established by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company and you hereby
consent and agree that the cash proceeds may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. Further, if the proceeds
from your participation in the Omnibus Plan are converted to local currency, you acknowledge that the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) is under no obligation to secure any currency conversion rate, and may face delays in converting the proceeds to local currency due
to  exchange  control  restrictions  in  China.  You  agree  to  bear  the  risk  of  any  currency  conversion  rate  fluctuation  between  the  date  that  your
proceeds are delivered to such special exchange control account and the date of conversion of the proceeds to local currency.

You further agree to comply with any other requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance
with exchange control requirements in China.

COLOMBIA

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Labor Law Acknowledgment.
You  acknowledge  that  pursuant  to  Article  15  Law  50/1990  (Article  128  of  the  Colombian  Labor  Code)  the  Omnibus  Plan,  the  PSUs,  the
underlying  Shares,  and  any  other  amounts  or  payments  granted  or  realized  from  participation  in  the  Omnibus  Plan  do  not  constitute  a
component of your “salary” for any legal purpose. To this extent, they will not be included and/or considered for purposes of calculating any
and all labor benefits, such as legal/fringe benefits, vacation pay, termination or other indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions
or any other labor-related amount which may be payable.

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
The  Shares  are  not  and  will  not  be  registered  with  the  Colombian  registry  of  publicly  traded  securities  (Registro  Nacional  de  Valores  y
Emisores) and, therefore, the Shares may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing in the Omnibus Plan, the Agreement or any other
document evidencing the grant of the PSUs should be construed as making a public offer of securities in Colombia.

Exchange Control Information.
You  are  responsible  for  complying  with  any  and  all  Colombian  foreign  exchange  restrictions,  approvals  and  reporting  requirements  in
connection with the PSUs and the Shares you acquire or funds you receive under the Omnibus Plan.  This may include reporting obligations to
the Central Bank (Banco de la República).  If applicable, you must determine whether you will treat your investments (e.g., the Shares) as (a) a
permanent investment or (b) a temporary investment as follows:

a) Permanent Investment:  If you determine that your investment will be permanent (i.e., because you wish to remain a shareholder), you

will be required to register such investment with the Central Bank, regardless of its value.

b) Temporary  /  Financial  Investment:    If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  determine  that  your  investment  will  be  temporary  (and  therefore
considered a “financial investment” under applicable regulations), you will be required to register such investment with the Central
Bank only if the aggregate value of the investment (as of December 31 for each year) is equal to or greater than US$500,000.

In either case, you must file the Central Bank’s Form 11.  Colombian law does not provide specific criteria to differentiate between treatment as
a permanent investment or temporary / financial investment.  You should consult with your personal or legal advisor regarding any obligations
that you may have as a result of participating in the Omnibus Plan.

COSTA RICA

There are no country-specific provisions.

INDONESIA

NOTIFICATIONS

Exchange Control Information.
Indonesian residents must provide the Bank of Indonesia with information on foreign exchange activities in an online monthly report no later
than the fifteenth day of the month following the activity. In addition, if you remit funds into Indonesia (e.g., proceeds from the sale of Shares),
the  Indonesian  bank  through  which  the  transaction  is  made  will  submit  a  report  of  the  transaction  to  the  Bank  of  Indonesia  for  statistical
reporting purposes. For transactions of US$10,000 or more, a more detailed description of the transaction must be included in the report and
you may be required

to provide information about the transaction (e.g., the relationship between you and the transferor of the funds, the source of the funds, etc.) to
the bank in order for the bank to complete the report.

ITALY

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Data Privacy.
This provision replaces the Data Privacy section of the Agreement in its entirety:

Pursuant to Section 13 of the Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, you understand that the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates may hold

unvested or outstanding ("Data") for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Omnibus Plan.
You  are  aware  that  providing  the  Company  with  your  Data  is  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the  Agreement  and  that  your  refusal  to
provide  such  Data  would  make  it  impossible  for  the  Company  to  perform  its  contractual  obligations  and  may  affect  your  ability  to
participate in the Omnibus Plan.

The Controller of personal Data processing is The Kraft Heinz Company, One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, U.S.A. Heinz
Italia S.p.A., is the Company's Representative for privacy purposes pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003. You understand that the

applicable  Italian  data  privacy  laws  and  regulations,  does  not  require  your  consent  thereto  as  the  processing  is  necessary  for  the
performance  of  contractual  obligations  related  to  the  implementation,  administration  and  management  of  the  Omnibus  Plan,  which
represents the legal basis for the processing. You understand that Data processing relating to the purposes above specified shall take place
under automated or non-automated conditions, anonymously when possible, that comply with the purposes for which Data is collected and
with confidentiality and security provisions as set forth by applicable Italian data privacy laws and regulations, with specific reference to

participation in the Omnibus Plan. You understand that pursuant to art.7 of D.lgs 196/2003, you have the right, including but not limited to,
access, delete, update, request the rectification or erasure of your Data and cease, for legitimate reasons, the Data processing. Furthermore,
you are aware that your Data will not be used for direct marketing purposes. In addition, the Data provided can be reviewed and questions
or complaints can be addressed by contacting your local human resources representative.

documents  in  their  entirety  and  fully  understand  and  accept  all  terms  of  such  documents.  In  this  regard,  you  acknowledge  having  read  and

(iii)  Repayment/Forfeiture;  (iv)  Withholding  Taxes;  (v)  No  Guarantee  of  Continued  Employment;  (vi)  Nature  of  Grant;  (vii)  Entire
Agreement/Governing Law; and (viii) the terms and conditions set forth immediately above in this section of Appendix I for Italy.

NOTIFICATIONS

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
Italian  residents  who,  during  the  fiscal  year,  hold  investments  abroad  or  foreign  financial  assets  (e.g.,  cash,  Shares  and  PSUs)  which  may
generate income taxable in Italy are required to report such on their annual tax returns (UNICO Form, RW Schedule) or on a special form if no
tax return is due. The same reporting obligations apply to Italian residents who, even if they do not directly hold investments abroad or foreign
financial assets (e.g., cash, Shares and PSUs), are beneficial owners of the investment pursuant to Italian money laundering provisions.

Tax on Foreign Financial Assets.
Italian residents may be subject to tax on the value of financial assets held outside of Italy. The taxable amount will be the fair market value of
the financial assets, including Shares assessed at the end of the calendar year. If you are subject to this foreign financial assets tax, you will
need  to  report  the  value  of  your  financial  assets  held  abroad  in  your  annual  tax  return.  You  are  encouraged  to  consult  your  personal  legal
advisor for additional information about the foreign financial assets tax.

JAPAN

NOTIFICATIONS

Foreign Assets/Account Reporting Information.
If you are a Japanese tax resident, you will be required to report details of any assets held outside of Japan as of December 31st (including any
Shares  or  cash  acquired  under  the  Omnibus  Plan)  to  the  extent  such  assets  have  a  total  net  fair  market  value  exceeding  ¥50,000,000.  Such
report will be due by March 15th each year. You should consult with your personal tax advisor as to whether the reporting obligation applies to
you and whether you will be required to include details of any outstanding Shares, PSUs or cash held by you in the report.

NETHERLANDS

NEW ZEALAND

Notifications

Securities Law Information.
WARNING - You are being offered PSUs (which, upon vesting in accordance with the terms of the grant of the PSUs, will be converted into
Shares) in the Company. Shares give you a stake in the ownership of the Company. You may receive a return if dividends are paid. Shares are
quoted  on  the  Nasdaq.  This  means  you  may  be  able  to  sell  them  on  the  Nasdaq  if  there  are  interested  buyers.  You  may  get  less  than  you
invested. The price will depend on the demand for the Shares.

If the Company runs into financial difficulties and is wound up, you will be paid only after all creditors have been paid. You may lose some or
all of your investment.

New Zealand law normally requires people who offer financial products to give information to investors before they invest. This information is
designed to help investors to make an informed decision. The usual rules do not apply to this offer because it is made under an employee share
scheme.  As  a  result,  you  may  not  be  given  all  the  information  usually  required.  You  will  also  have  fewer  other  legal  protections  for  this
investment.

In compliance with applicable New Zealand securities laws, you are entitled to receive, in electronic or other form and free of cost, copies of
the Company's latest annual report, relevant financial statements and the auditor's report on said financial statements (if any).

Ask questions, read all documents carefully, and seek independent financial advice before committing yourself.

SINGAPORE

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
The grant of the PSUs is being made pursuant to the "Qualifying Person" exemption under section 273(1)(f) of the Securities and Futures Act
(Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.) ("SFA"), under which it is exempt from the prospectus and registration requirements under the SFA. The Omnibus
Plan has not been lodged or registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the grant of the PSUs is not made with a
view to the PSUs or Shares being subsequently offered to another party. You should note that the PSUs are subject to section 257 of the SFA
and you should not make any subsequent sale of Shares in Singapore or any offer of such subsequent sale of Shares subject to the awards in
Singapore, unless such sale or offer in is made: (i) more than six (6) months from the Grant Date or (ii) pursuant to the exemptions under Part
XIII Division (1) Subdivision (4) (other than section 280) of the SFA.

Chief Executive Officer/Director Notification Requirement.
If you are the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), a director, associate director or shadow director of the Company's Singapore Subsidiary or
Affiliate, you are subject to certain notification requirements under the Singapore Companies Act. Among these requirements is an obligation
to notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate in writing when you receive an interest (e.g., PSUs, Shares) in the Company, a Subsidiary or
Affiliate. In addition, you must notify the Singapore Subsidiary or Affiliate when you sell Shares (including when you sell Shares issued upon
vesting and settlement of the PSUs). These notifications must be made within two (2) business days of acquiring or disposing of any interest in
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate. In addition, a notification of your interests in the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate must be made
within two (2) business days of becoming CEO or a director.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

NOTIFICATIONS

Securities Law Information.
The Omnibus Plan is being offered only to employees and is in the nature of providing equity incentives to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the United Arab Emirates ("UAE"). Any documents related to the Omnibus Plan, including the Omnibus Plan, the
Agreement, and other grant documents ("Omnibus Plan Documents"), are intended for distribution only to such employees and must not be
delivered to, or relied on by any other person. Prospective purchasers of the securities offered (i.e., the PSUs) should conduct their own due
diligence on the securities.

The Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority has no responsibility for reviewing or verifying any Omnibus Plan Documents nor has it
taken steps to verify the information set out in them, and thus, is not responsible for such documents. Further, neither the Ministry of Economy
nor the Dubai Department of Economic Development has approved this statement nor taken steps to verify the information set out in it, and has
no  responsibility  for  it.  If  you  do  not  understand  the  contents  of  the  Omnibus  Plan  Documents,  you  should  consult  an  authorized  financial
advisor.

UNITED KINGDOM

Terms & Conditions

Taxes.
The following provisions supplement the Taxes section of the Agreement:

Without limitation to the Taxes section of the Agreement, you agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all
such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the Company or the Employer or by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") (or any
other tax authority or any other relevant authority). You also

agree  to  indemnify  and  keep  indemnified  the  Company  and  the  Employer  against  any  Tax-Related  Items  that  they  are  required  to  pay  or
withhold or have paid or will pay on your behalf to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or an executive officer (as within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Act), the terms of the
immediately foregoing provision will not apply. In such case, if the amount of any income tax due is not collected from or paid by the you
within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year (April 6 - April 5) in which an event giving rise to the indemnification described above
occurs, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance
contributions (“NICs”) may be payable. You understand and agree that you will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on
this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Employer (as appropriate)
for the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Employer may recover from you by any of the
means referred to in the Plan or the Agreement.
