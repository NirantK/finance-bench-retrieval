INTRODUCTION

The following is Management’s discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) of

the first quarter of 2021.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This executive overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and does not contain all of the information that is important to
readers of this Form 10-Q. For a complete description of the trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting
estimates affecting the Firm and its various LOBs, this Form 10-Q and the 2020 Form 10-K should be read together and in their
entirety.

• Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion, up 12%,

predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense and continued investments in the
businesses. The increase in expense also included a $550
million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $4.2

billion driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit
losses of $5.2 billion, compared to an expense of $8.3
billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net
additions to the allowance for credit losses of $6.8
billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $25.6 billion at
March 31, 2021. The Firm had an allowance for loan
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.42%,
compared with 2.95% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and
2.32% in the prior year; the decrease from the fourth
quarter of 2020 was driven by net reductions in the
allowance for loan losses.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.3 billion at
March 31, 2021, an increase of $3.2 billion from the
prior year, reflecting client credit deterioration across
multiple industries, including Real Estate, in the
wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans
placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021,
nonperforming assets decreased $649 million from
December 31, 2020, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in
the wholesale portfolio, reflecting the impact of net
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas
and Individuals; and lower nonaccrual loans at fair value
in the CIB consumer portfolio, due to sales.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%,

driven by higher loans in AWM and CIB, predominantly
offset by lower loans in CCB and CB. The increase in loans
also reflects loans originated under the Paycheck
Protection Program (“PPP”) in CCB and CB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%,
reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily
driven by the effect of certain government actions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

• As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had average eligible High
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a
fair value of approximately $841 billion, resulting in
approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 for additional
information.

for additional information.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first
quarter of 2021 versus the first quarter of 2020, unless
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.3 billion for
the first quarter of 2021, or $4.50 per share, on net
revenue of $32.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 23%
and ROTCE of 29%. The Firm's results for the first quarter
of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses of $5.2 billion compared to an increase in the
allowance for credit losses of $6.8 billion in the prior year,
as well as a $550 million contribution to the Firm's
Foundation.

• Net income was $14.3 billion, up $11.4 billion.

• Total net revenue was up 14%. Noninterest revenue was
$19.4 billion, up 40%, predominantly driven by higher
CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees,
and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and
Other in CIB and markdowns on held-for-sale positions in
the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB recorded in
the prior year. Net interest income was $12.9 billion,
down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower
rates partially offset by balance sheet growth.

because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results will be in line with the outlook
set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for 2021 should be
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S.
economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets
activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive
environment, client and customer activity levels, and
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and
other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs.

Full-year 2021
• Management expects net interest income, on a managed

basis, to be approximately $55 billion, market
dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be
approximately $70 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card to be

approximately 2.5%.

Net interest income, on a managed basis, and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to

Post Brexit
Prior to December 31, 2020 the Firm substantially
completed its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program
which was intended to ensure the continuity of its business
and operations with respect to EU clients. On March 26,
2021, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a Memorandum of
Understanding that sets out a framework for regulatory
cooperation in relation to cross-border financial services.
The Firm will monitor developments and take any necessary
actions to ensure business continuity with respect to the
Firm's EU clients. Refer to Business Developments on page
50 of the 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority
confirmed that the publication of the principal tenors of
U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month,
six-month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease immediately
following a final publication on June 30, 2023. The
scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling, Japanese yen,
Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-week and two-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, remains December 31,
2021, and the Firm is prioritizing those currencies and
tenors of LIBOR for contract remediation in 2021.

The Firm continues to make progress on its initiatives to
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR
discontinuation, including contract remediation. The Firm
also continues to monitor the transition relief being
considered by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the
tax implications of reference rate reform. Refer to Business
Developments on page 51 of the 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected
discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has remained
focused on serving its clients, customers and communities,
as well as the well-being of its employees.

The Firm has raised capital and provided credit to support
its customers and clients. The Firm continues to participate
in the Small Business Association’s (“SBA”) PPP and since
inception of the Program has funded approximately $40
billion as of April 30, 2021. While the Firm’s temporary
assistance measures for those impacted by the pandemic
have steadily declined since early 2020, the Firm continues
to assist those impacted, primarily in the form of payment
deferrals.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for further information
on PPP; Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 48-52 and
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62 for further
information on retained loans under payment deferral.
Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's
2020 Form 10-K for further information on PPP; Consumer
Credit Portfolio on page 116 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio
on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on retained loans under payment
deferral.

The Firm remains focused on the well-being of its
employees. While the vast majority of its global workforce
continue to work from home, the Firm is actively monitoring
the health and safety situations at local and regional levels,
and will adapt its plans as these situations evolve.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic
To address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the U.S. government as well as central banks and banking
authorities around the world have taken and continue to
take actions to help individuals, households and businesses
that have been adversely affected by the economic
disruption caused by the pandemic. In the U.S., several
stimulus packages were enacted including the CARES Act in
March of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act in
December of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act in
March of 2021, which provided funding to support loan
facilities to assist consumers and businesses and stimulus
payments to individuals.

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic on pages 52-53 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for further discussion on U.S. government actions
impacting the Firm and U.S. government facilities and
programs in which the Firm has participated.

Investment banking fees increased across products in CIB,
reflecting:

The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected
net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27
and pages 33-34, and Note 5 for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased reflecting:

• lower deposit-related fees in CCB given the higher

deposits held in existing and new accounts,

predominantly offset by

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and higher
lending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees
in CIB.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages
23-27 and CB on pages 28-29, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees
as a result of:

• higher equity underwriting fees largely driven by the IPO

• strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity

market due to increased industry-wide fees

• higher advisory fees driven by a higher number of

completed transactions, in part related to transactions
announced in the second half of 2020, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by high-yield bonds
and leveraged loans due to increased industry-wide fees
and wallet share gains.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, in part due to
the absence of two significant items in the prior year: a
$951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other; and
an $896 million markdown on held-for-sale positions, in the
bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.
Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue
increased in CIB driven by strong performance in:

• Equity Markets across derivatives, Cash Equities, and

prime brokerage, and

• Fixed Income Markets particularly in Securitized Products
and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and
Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong
prior year.

products and higher average market levels, net of
liquidity fee waivers, in AWM, and to a lesser extent,

• higher levels of investment assets on higher average

market levels and net inflows in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 20-22 and
pages 30-32, respectively, and Note 5 for information on
asset management, administration and commissions
revenue.

Investment securities gains in both periods reflected the
impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio.
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and
Note 9 for information on investment securities gains.

Mortgage fees and related income increased
predominantly due to higher mortgage production revenue
reflecting higher production margins and volumes.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, Note 5 and
14 for further information.

Card income increased driven by lower acquisition costs,
and higher net interchange income in CCB, with debit and
credit card sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 and Note 5
for further information.

Other income decreased reflecting:
• Weather-related write-downs on certain renewable

energy investments, as well as increased amortization on
a higher level of alternative energy investments in the
tax-oriented investment portfolio in CIB. The increased
amortization was more than offset by lower income tax
expense from the associated tax credits

• lower gains on certain Corporate investments, and

• lower operating lease income from a decline in auto

operating lease volume in CCB,

partially offset by

• net valuation gains on certain investments, compared

with losses in the prior year, in AWM, and

• the absence of losses on certain equity investments in CIB

in the prior year.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by the
impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet
growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.1
trillion, up $661 billion, predominantly driven by higher
deposits with banks and investment securities, and the yield
was 1.87%, down 127 basis points (“bps”), primarily due
to lower rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE
basis, was 1.69%, a decrease of 68 bps. The net yield
excluding CIB Markets was 1.93%, down 108 bps.

Net yield on an FTE basis, and net yield excluding CIB
Markets are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates
schedule on page 162 for further details; and the
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a further
discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB Markets.

The provision for credit losses decreased driven by net
reductions in both the consumer and wholesale allowance
for credit losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:
• a $4.5 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses,
including $3.5 billion in Card reflecting improvements in
the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and $625 million in
Home Lending primarily due to the continued
improvement in home price index ("HPI") expectations
and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, reflecting

lower charge-offs and higher recoveries primarily
benefiting from payment assistance and government
stimulus;

• the prior year included a $4.4 billion addition to the

allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflects a net reduction of $716
million in the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22, CIB on pages
23-27, CB on pages 28-29, AWM on pages 30-32, the

three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Compensation expense increased predominantly driven by
higher revenue-related expense in CIB, as well as the impact
of investments in the businesses.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher contribution expense, which included a $550
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's
Foundation

• higher investments in the businesses, including

technology, and

• higher FDIC-related expense largely driven by balance

sheet growth,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense, predominantly in CIB, and

• lower other structural expense, including lower travel and
entertainment across the businesses and lower operating
losses.

Other volume- and revenue-related expense was relatively
flat as the increase in brokerage expense in CIB and
distribution expense in AWM was offset by lower
depreciation from the decline in auto lease assets in CCB.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in
deposits and lower opportunities in Treasury and CIO to
deploy funds in securities purchased under resale
agreements. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s
placements of its excess cash with various central banks,
including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements decreased driven by the lower deployment of
funds in Treasury and CIO; and in CIB lower client-driven
market-making activities, partially offset by higher demand
for securities to cover short positions. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 42-46 and Note 10 for
additional information.

Securities borrowed increased driven by client-driven
activities in Fixed Income Financing and Equity Markets, and
higher demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and
Note 10 for additional information.

Trading assets increased due to strong client-driven
market-making activities in equity instruments in CIB
Markets, including prime brokerage. Refer to Notes 2 and 4
for additional information.
Investment securities increased, reflecting net purchases
of U.S. Treasuries in the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio
predominantly offset by a decrease in the available-for-sale
("AFS") portfolio. The decrease in AFS was due to paydowns
and net valuation losses, partially offset by net purchases.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 65, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information on Investment
securities.

Loans were flat as:

• the reduction in Card due to the impact of seasonality,
and higher payment rates; lower loans in CB; and net
paydowns in Home Lending

were offset by

• the origination of PPP loans in CBB and CB; growth in CIB
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, and in AWM
securities-based and custom lending, as well as
mortgages.

The allowance for loan losses decreased consisting of:

• a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser
extent portfolio run-off, and

• an $875 million net reduction in wholesale, across the

LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic scenarios.

There was a $107 million addition to the allowance for
lending-related commitments, which is included in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The total net
reduction to the allowance for credit losses was $5.2
billion, as of March 31, 2021.

12

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
47-65, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more detailed
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased
largely due to higher client receivables related to client-
driven activities in CIB prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased driven by
higher MSRs as a result of lower prepayment speeds on
higher rates, as well as net additions to the MSRs. Refer to
Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of
securities financing transactions in CIB prime brokerage, as
well as higher cash collateral placed with central
counterparties ("CCPs"). Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities lending transactions.

(a)  Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by the
effect of certain government actions in response to the
COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by
lower spending, as well as growth from existing and new
accounts across both consumer and small business
customers. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
42-46 and Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• higher secured financing of AFS investment securities in
Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading assets in CIB,
and

• the impact of client activities in CIB.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 and
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased as a result of higher
financing of prime brokerage activities, and net issuance of
structured notes in CIB, as well as the issuance of
commercial paper in Treasury and CIO. Refer to pages
42-46 for information on changes in Liquidity Risk
Management.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, which
resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt
instruments, partially offset by lower derivative payables as
a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased largely
due to the impact of securities financing transactions in CIB
prime brokerage. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities lending transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased
driven by lower issuances as a result of lower loan balances
in the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 15 and Notes 13 and
22 for further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt was relatively flat as maturities and fair
value hedge accounting adjustments related to higher rates
were offset by net issuances. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 42-46 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity was relatively flat as net income was
offset by the impact of capital actions and a decrease in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The
decrease in AOCI was driven by the impact of higher rates
on the AFS securities portfolio and cash flow hedges. Refer
to page 82 for information on changes in stockholders’
equity, Capital actions on pages 39-40, and Note 19 for
additional information on AOCI.

securities, net originations of loans, and purchases of
assets from money market mutual fund clients pursuant
to nonrecourse advances provided by the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston ("FRBB") under the Money Market Mutual
Fund Liquidity Facility ("MMLF").

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on
pages 79-83.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment
level. These non-GAAP measures include:
• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to
present total net revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE”
basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue

less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained,

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of customer
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The
management reporting process that derives business
segment results includes the allocation of certain income
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may
be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business
metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and
analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business
segments may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or service, with
allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the
transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-
sharing agreements.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page 98 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business
segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of those methodologies.

(a) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $916 million and
$1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

(b) Included MSR risk management results of $(115) million and $(90)
million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 6%.

Net interest income was $7.9 billion, down 14%, driven by:

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, lower

loans in Card due to the cumulative impact of lower spend
throughout 2020 and higher payment rates, and lower
loans in Home Lending due to net paydowns,

partially offset by

• growth in deposits in CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion, up 12%, driven by:

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher

production margins and volumes, and

• higher card income due to lower acquisition costs and

higher net interchange income, with debit and credit card
sales volume returning to pre-pandemic levels,

partially offset by

• lower deposit-related fees given the higher deposits held

in existing and new accounts, and

• lower auto lease volume.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and
mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, relatively flat,
reflecting:

• higher investments in the business

offset by

• lower structural expenses, and

• lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including

lower depreciation on auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $3.6
billion, compared with an expense of $5.8 billion in the prior
year, driven by:

primarily reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic scenarios, consisting of $3.5 billion in
Card, $625 million in Home Lending, primarily due to the
continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a
lesser extent portfolio run-off, $350 million in CBB and
$150 million in Auto, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment
assistance and government stimulus.

The prior year included a $4.5 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance
for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans
90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of
$458 million and $616 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(b) At March 31, 2021 and 2020, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S.
government agencies of $557 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, that
are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(c) Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs

offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 48-52 for further information on consumer payment
assistance activity. The first quarter of 2021 includes loans to customers
that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or
more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-
dependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of
amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.
(d) At March 31, 2021, included $23.4 billion of loans in Business Banking

under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm
does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on page 47 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) At March 31, 2021, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card
and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic were $8.1 billion, $105 million and $127 million,
respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms
are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 48-52 for further information on consumer payment
assistance activity.

(a) Includes credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally

within CIB and funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives
and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, which
are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are
presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA
amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.7 billion, up 189%.

Net revenue was $14.6 billion, up 46%.

Banking revenue was $4.5 billion, up 70%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up 222%,

driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 57%,
reflecting higher fees across products, and the absence of
prior year markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the
bridge financing portfolio. The Firm ranked #2 for Global
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.1 billion, up 219%,
largely driven by the IPO market due to increased
industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.3 billion, up 17%,

driven by high yield bonds and leveraged loans due to
increased industry-wide fees and wallet share gains.

– Advisory fees were $680 million, up 35%, driven by a

higher number of completed transactions, in part
related to transactions announced in the second half of
2020.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion, down 2%,
driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly
offset by the impact of higher deposit balances.

• Lending revenue was $265 million, down 24%,

predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of
accrual loans in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $10.1 billion, up
37%. Markets revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.8 billion, up 15%,

predominantly driven by strong performance in
Securitized Products and Credit, largely offset by lower

23

revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets
compared to a strong prior year.

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.3 billion, up 47%, driven
by strong performance across derivatives, Cash Equities,
and prime brokerage.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 2%,

with deposit margin compression largely offset by deposit
balance growth.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $3 million,

compared with a loss of $951 million in the prior year
which was predominantly driven by funding spread
widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $7.1 billion, up 19%,
predominantly driven by higher revenue-related
compensation expense, partially offset by lower legal
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $331
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $1.4 billion in the
prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages
47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm
assesses its Markets business performance on a total
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5
and 6 for a description of the composition of these income
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 74
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information.
For the periods presented below, the predominant source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized
upon executing new transactions.

(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 18 for discussion of

revenue sharing.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up $1.0 billion, predominantly
driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.4 billion, up 11%. Net interest income
was $1.5 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit margin
compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit
balances and lending revenue due to increased portfolio
spreads. Noninterest revenue was $917 million, up 51%,
predominantly driven by higher investment banking
revenue, the absence of prior year markdowns in the bridge
financing portfolio, and higher deposit-related fees,
particularly cash management fees.

Noninterest expense was $969 million, down 2%, driven by
lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $118
million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, compared with an expense of $1.0 billion in the
prior year.

Quarterly results
Net income was $1.2 billion, up 86%.

Net revenue was $4.1 billion, up 20%. Net interest income
was $931 million, up 8%. Noninterest revenue was $3.1
billion, up 24%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, up 26%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on strong cumulative net
inflows into long-term and liquidity products and higher
average market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers, and

• net investment valuation gains, compared with losses in

the prior year.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $1.9 billion, up
15%, largely driven by:

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset

management fees, loan margin expansion and an
investment valuation gain,

largely offset by

• deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 6%
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, partially offset by lower structural
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $121
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

47-65 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63–64 for

Quarterly results
Net loss was $580 million compared with a net loss of $125
million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639 million.
The decrease was driven by:

• lower net interest income on lower rates, as well as
limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to
continued deposit growth,

partially offset by

• higher noninterest revenue reflecting net gains on certain

legacy private equity investments compared with net
losses in the prior year, offset by lower investment
securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the
investment securities portfolio, as well as lower gains on
certain Corporate investments.

Noninterest expense of $876 million was up $730 million
primarily due to a higher contribution to the Firm's
Foundation and higher structural expense.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes as well as the
impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year expected tax rate
relative to the level of year-to-date pretax income, partially
offset by the resolution of certain tax audits.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk.
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects
the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires,
among other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and

escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation
framework with strong internal governance and
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

35

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business
activities and associated risks during normal economic
environments and under stressed conditions.

The Firm has been impacted by market events as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, but has remained well-capitalized.

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and
stress testing.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and
internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies
("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and its insured
depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is
determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”),
which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an
advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the
risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is
evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
minimum capital ratios.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for additional
information.

Key Regulatory Developments
CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of their
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided
the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of
CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022
(“CECL capital transition provisions”).

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31,
2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion,
which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings
and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for
credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances
on PCD loans).

36

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Capital Risk
Management on pages 91-101 and Note 1 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL
capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting
guidance.

SLR temporary revision. The Federal Reserve issued an
interim final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the
calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of
calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to exclude
the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities
and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions
became effective April 1, 2020, and remained in effect
through March 31, 2021.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and FDIC issued an
interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and
remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides
IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary
exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31,
2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this
exclusion.

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued
an interim final rule (issued as final on September 29,
2020) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of
participating in the PPP on risk-based capital ratios by
applying a zero percent risk weight to loans originated
under the program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by
the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit
losses on these loans. As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had
approximately $32 billion of loans under the program.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR
includes PPP loans as the Firm did not participate in the
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending
(“PPPL”) Facility, which would allow the Firm to exclude
them under the final rule.

TLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by certain
large banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the scope of the existing
capital deductions rule around the holdings of capital
instruments of financial institutions to also include TLAC
debt instruments issued by systemically important banking
organizations. The final rule became effective April 1, 2021
and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm’s
risk-based capital metrics.

The following table presents the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized
and Advanced approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of these capital metrics.

Common stock dividends
The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend is currently

approval by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Common stock
On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm
temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock.
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks,
including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases
through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the
Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including
the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in
the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm
announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As
directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and
common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were
restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s
net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. On
March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these
restrictions through at least the second quarter of 2021.

Refer to capital planning and stress testing on page 40 for

Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On April 5, 2021, the Firm submitted its 2021 Capital Plan
to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2021
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR")
process. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will
disclose the Firm’s indicative Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB")
requirement which will become effective October 1, 2021
and summary information regarding the Firm’s stress test
results by July 1, 2021. The Firm's SCB is currently 3.3%.

Based on the Federal Reserve's March 25, 2021
announcement, if the Firm remains above all of its
minimum risk-based capital requirements based on the
2021 CCAR stress test results, the temporary restrictions on
capital distributions currently in effect will expire as
planned on June 30, 2021. However, if the Firm falls below
any of its minimum risk-based requirements in the 2021
CCAR stress test it will remain subject to the temporary
restrictions through at least September 30, 2021.

Refer to Capital planning and stress testing on pages 91-92
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on CCAR.

Other capital requirements

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its
assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of
its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is
not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a
minimum of 100%. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020
based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.

borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or
investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR was 110% for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

The Firm's average LCR decreased during the three months
ended March 31, 2021, compared with the prior year period
primarily due to the relative impact on net cash outflows from
a significant increase in deposits.

42

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR increased during
the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with both
the three month periods ended December 31, 2020 and
March 31, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits
continued to increase in the first quarter primarily driven by
the effect of certain government actions in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in excess liquidity in
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s
reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due
to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash
outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA
above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities,
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes
would be available to raise liquidity. This includes securities
included as part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately
$841 billion and $740 billion as of March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of
liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased
compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to an
increase in CIB trading assets and an increase in excess
eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was
primarily a result of increased deposits.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal
Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount window at the
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the
Firm to such banks of approximately $301 billion and $307
billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of
cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or
other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at
the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central
banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and the other central banks as a primary source of
liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is intended
to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On
October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final
NSFR rule under which large banking organizations such as
the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least
100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become
effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to
publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually
beginning in 2023.

The Firm estimates that it is compliant with the 100%
minimum NSFR which becomes effective July 1, 2021, based
on its current understanding of the final rule.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity
risk characteristics.

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March 31, 2021, and December 31,

Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of
total liabilities, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the
LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain government
actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the
increase was also driven by lower spending, as well as
growth from existing and new accounts across both
consumer and small business customers.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on
pages 18-34 and pages 12-13, respectively, for further
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

(f) Includes nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF. Refer to page 106 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the

MMLF.

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at
March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020,
reflecting higher secured financing of AFS investment
securities in Treasury and CIO, as well as higher trading
assets in CIB, and the impact of client activities in CIB.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding consist
of other borrowed funds and issuance of wholesale
commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper at
March 31, 2021, from December 31, 2020 was due to
higher net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity
management.

44

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance
and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the
IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 15, and
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note
4 for additional information on the impact of a credit
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs,
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021,

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold through

credit derivatives used to manage both performing and nonperforming
wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not qualify for hedge
accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit derivatives on page 62 and Note 4
for additional information.

(c) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets excluded
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government
agencies of $798 million and $874 million, respectively, and real estate
owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of $8 million and $9
million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by
regulatory guidance.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The
majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications
have not been considered troubled debt restructurings
(“TDRs”). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers
and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due or
nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on
pages 48-52 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 53-62
for information on loan modifications as of March 31, 2021.
Refer to Notes 12 and 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form
10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies
for loan modifications and the allowance for credit losses.
Paycheck Protection Program
The Firm continues to participate in the PPP, for which the
application deadline was extended to May 31, 2021. At
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had
approximately $32 billion and $27 billion of loans under the
PPP, respectively, including $23 billion and $19 billion in the
consumer portfolio, and $9 billion and $8 billion in the
wholesale portfolio. The impact on interest income related to
PPP loans was not material for the three months ended
March 31, 2021.
When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the
forgiveness amount from the SBA. The Firm continues to
process forgiveness applications and through March 31,
2021, approximately $7 billion of loans were forgiven.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's
2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion on the PPP.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of
residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto
and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-
related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving
primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market.
In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic
environment continued to improve. The credit performance
of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs,
benefited from government stimulus programs, payment
deferrals and increasing home prices. The Firm may obtain

credit protection against certain pools of loans in the
retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit
linked notes. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q; and
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-120 and Note 12 of
JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information
on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and
charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 22 of this Form
10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on lending-related commitments.

(b) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, excluded operating lease assets of $20.0 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets

are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $23.4 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that
PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 47 for a
further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.
(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.
(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(i) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies

of $798 million and $874 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited

COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged down
to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(k) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $21.3 billion and $22.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,

respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals.
As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had $9.3 billion of retained
loans under payment deferral programs, which represented
a decrease of approximately $1.5 billion from December 31,
2020, $3.0 billion from September 30, 2020 and $19.0
billion from June 30, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021,
there were approximately $886 million of new enrollments

in payment deferral programs predominantly in residential
real estate and credit card. Predominantly all borrowers that
exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans
subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period
and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to
resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers
expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these
loans in its allowance for credit losses.

September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.
The weighted average LTV ratio of residential real estate loans under payment deferral at March 31, 2021 was 52%.
Excludes risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB and auto operating lease assets that were still under payment deferral programs.
Auto operating lease asset payment assistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered three month payment deferral). Deferrals
do not extend the term of the lease and all deferred payments are due at the end of the lease term.
Includes $3.6 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral as of March 31, 2021,

89% of the balance that exited deferral were current at March 31, 2021.

(f)

Of the $9.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral
programs as of March 31, 2021, approximately $3.9 billion
were accounted for as TDRs, either because they were
accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or because
they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to
suspend TDR accounting guidance provided by the CARES Act
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Predominantly all borrowers, including those with loans
accounted for as TDRs, were current upon enrollment in
payment deferral programs and are expected to exit
payment deferral programs in a current status, either
because no payments are contractually due during the
deferral period or because payments originally contractually
due during the deferral period will be due at maturity upon
exit. For those borrowers that are unable to resume making
payments in accordance with the original or modified
contractual terms of their agreements upon exit from
deferral programs, they will be placed on nonaccrual status
in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit
cards as permitted by regulatory guidance, and charged off

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2020 driven
by higher loans in auto and other reflecting PPP loan
originations, partially offset by lower residential real estate
loans.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit.

The retained loan portfolio declined from December 31,
2020 due to paydowns predominantly in Home Lending
which were largely offset by originations of prime mortgage
loans in Home Lending and AWM. Retained nonaccrual
loans were relatively flat from December 31, 2020. Net
recoveries for the three months ended March 31, 2021
were lower when compared with the same period in the
prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a
loan sale in Home Lending.

The loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value portfolio
increased from December 31, 2020 largely driven by
warehouse loans in Home Lending. Nonaccrual loans at fair
value decreased from December 31, 2020 largely due to
sales in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit
outstanding was $22.2 billion at March 31, 2021. This
amount included $8.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have
been modified and $7.3 billion of interest-only balloon
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were
$25.9 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These loans
have an interest-only payment period generally followed by
an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly
in AWM. Charge-offs for the three months ended March 31,
2021 were consistent with the broader residential
mortgage portfolio as the performance of this portfolio is
generally in line with the performance of the broader
residential mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale
and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to
certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to
government-insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions and,
therefore, are not TDRs, or loans for which the Firm has
elected to apply the option to suspend the application of
accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act
and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Refer

Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table
above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in
accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional
information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with
Ginnie Mae.

(b) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans
included $3.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than
90 days past due. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about
loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

50

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared
with December 31, 2020 due to PPP loan originations net
of forgiveness in Business Banking as well as from growth in
the auto portfolio from loan originations, largely offset by
paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent
loans. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were
0.13% and 0.41% for the three months ended March 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. Auto charge-offs for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 benefited from
government stimulus, payment assistance programs, and
high vehicle collateral values.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2020
reflecting the impact of seasonality as well as higher
payment rates. The March 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day
delinquency rates of 1.40% and 0.80%, respectively,
decreased compared to the December 31, 2020 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%,
respectively. The delinquency rates were positively
impacted by borrowers who received payment assistance
and government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with the
same period in the prior year reflecting lower charge-offs
and higher recoveries primarily benefiting from payment
assistance and government stimulus.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans
typically remain on accrual status until charged off.
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further
information about this portfolio, including information
about delinquencies.

Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and

Modifications of credit card loans
At March 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.3 billion of credit card
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 11 for
additional information about loan modification programs to
borrowers.

sheets.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold
through credit derivatives used to manage both performing and
nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not
qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit
derivatives on page 62 and Note 4 for additional information.
(c) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit
risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all
of these loans were considered performing.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and
counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities),
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the
loans that it originates into the market as part of its
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry,
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry
discussion on pages 55-59 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated
exposures held in CCB including business banking and auto
dealer for which the wholesale methodology is applied
when determining the allowance for credit losses.

In the first quarter of 2021, the macroeconomic
environment continued to improve following the broad-
based credit deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of March 31, 2021, retained loans remained relatively
flat while lending related commitments increased $31.4
billion from December 31, 2020 to $481.2 billion, driven
by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase
in held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the
investment- grade percentage of the credit portfolio
decreased from 71% to 69% driven by net portfolio
activity, including new commitments. Criticized exposure
increased $5.3 billion from $41.6 billion at December 31,
2020 to $46.9 billion at March 31, 2021, driven by select
downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades.
Nonperforming exposure was relatively flat at $4.9 billion
and net charge off activity was $53 million.

53

Wholesale assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals and
covenant modifications.

As of March 31, 2021, the Firm had approximately $1.3
billion of retained loans still under payment deferral,
representing 0.25% of the loan portfolio which has
decreased approximately $0.3 billion from December 31,
2020, $5.0 billion from September 30, 2020, and $15.5
billion from June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that

exited deferral are current or have paid down their loans,
and the Firm has not experienced significant new payment
deferral requests. The Firm continues to monitor the credit
risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout
the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the
borrowers are required to resume making regularly
scheduled payments and considers expected losses of
principal and accrued interest on these loans in its
allowance for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment
deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications were insignificant
or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered
performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31,
2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to
BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the
internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on
internal risk ratings.

(a) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio, and loans at fair value.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity.
Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or
changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-
for-sale and loans at fair value, was $46.9 billion at
March 31, 2021, compared with $41.6 billion at
December 31, 2020, representing approximately 4.4% and
4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. The
increase in total criticized exposure was driven by select
downgrades, partially offset by select upgrades . The total
criticized exposure was largely undrawn and $42.8 billion
was performing.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to
Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual
loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020. Since March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loan exposure
increased $1.5 billion, driven by downgrades across
multiple industries on client credit deterioration, with the
largest concentration in Real Estate, predominantly within
Retail and Lodging. In the three months ended March 31,
2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased $390 million,
when compared to December 31, 2020 driven by net
portfolio activity and select client upgrades in Oil & Gas and
Individuals.

foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily
— was approximately 88% at both March 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of
derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets were $73.1 billion and $79.6
billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively, with decreases in CIB resulting from market
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally
enforceable master netting agreements and the related
cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held
liquid securities and other cash collateral that the Firm
believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. Liquid securities represents high quality liquid assets
as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the
appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take
into consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high quality
liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the Firm believes
is legally enforceable. The collateral amounts for each
counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables
for the counterparty. The following tables summarize the
net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile
for the periods presented.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients.
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to
Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily
marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally
held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the
Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to
reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are
reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the table above, it is
available as security against potential exposure that could
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative
contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with various exposures.

investment securities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts
payable and other liabilities, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is
recognized within Investment Securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021
decreased when compared to December 31, 2020,
consisting of:

• a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser
extent portfolio run-off, and

• a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the

LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic scenarios

While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the
Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not
experienced in recent history, which has created additional
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and
increased the reliance on management judgment. These
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates
remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during
2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range
of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have
been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately
address these economic circumstances.

Further, despite the improvement in the economy,
uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying
labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains,
and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a
result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above
eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six
percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. gross

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio
or from principal investments. The investment securities
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are
predominantly privately-held non-traded financial
instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate.
Investments are typically intended to be held over extended
periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly
invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2021, the
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of
allowance for credit losses, was $595.4 billion, and the
average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and where not available, based primarily upon
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings.
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 66-70 for
further information on the market risk inherent in the
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
42-46 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately held non-
traded financial instruments representing ownership or
other forms of junior capital and span multiple asset
classes. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In
general, principal investments include tax-oriented
investments and investments made to enhance or
accelerate the Firm’s business strategies. The Firm’s
investments will continue to evolve in line with its
strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to support
underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios have not been significantly
affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
uncertainties remain that could result in future negative
impacts.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of
the principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held
for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk
monitoring and control, and predominant business activities
that give rise to market risk.

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures
by leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market
conditions occur, such as those observed at the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 73.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate
those measures accordingly over time.

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures,
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on
pages 140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(c) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification

benefit is not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR increased by $10 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 when compared with the
prior quarter driven by increases in exposure in fixed
income, partially offset by volatility which occurred in late
March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period.

Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $47 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same
period in the prior year. This increase was driven by
volatility which occurred at the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic and predominantly impacted exposure in fixed
income, as well as increases from Corporate VaR due to the
inclusion of a private equity position that became publicly
traded at the end of the third quarter of 2020. These
increases were partially offset by risk reductions in equities.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based
measures to more effectively measure the risk from these
loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average Total
VaR and each of the components would have been higher
by the amounts reported in the following table:

increased by $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared with the same period in the prior year.
However, as of March 31, 2021 daily Risk Management VaR has declined from March 31, 2020 as the volatility which occurred
in late March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to roll out of the one-year historical look-back period.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of
new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset
backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
For the 12 months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 165 of the 259 days, and observed two VaR
backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 47 of the 63 days,
and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and
three months ended March 31, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. A
backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day.
Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart
below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk
arises not only from trading activities but also from the
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and
issuing debt as well as from the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies).
These simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different
factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by
the Firm or its clients and customers in response to any
such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates,
the time since origination, and other factors which are
updated periodically based on historical experience.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit

betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid
could change upon a given change in market interest
rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these
scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid, due
to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s
interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income
(Refer to Outlook on page 7 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of
March 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 reflected
updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher long-term rates as
well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of
March 31, 2021, scenarios reflecting lower rates could
result in negative interest rates. The U.S. has never
experienced an interest rate environment where the
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy. While
the impact of negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings-
at-risk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward of
up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest income.
In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require
additional management judgment and therefore, the actual
outcomes may differ from these assumptions.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the
table below.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political
or other significant developments which adversely affect
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be
impacted by these developments and measures the extent
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Given the remaining uncertainty around the COVID-19
pandemic, Country Risk Management continues to monitor
the impact to individual countries.

Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk
management.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2021 and their
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2020. The
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s
internal country risk management approach, and does not
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate
from period to period due to client activity and market
flows.

The increase in exposure to Australia was predominantly
due to increased cash placements with the central bank of
Australia, driven by client activity following recent policy
decisions in the country and growth in client deposits.

Cybersecurity Risk
Due to the on-going impact of COVID-19, the Firm continues
to leverage use of remote access and also video
conferencing solutions provided by third parties to facilitate
remote work. As a result, the Firm deployed additional
precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk
The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level
across the industry, particularly during the COVID-19
pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment
authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams
involving the pandemic, including an increase in the level of
fraud attempts against consumers. The complexities of
these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators
continue to evolve. The Firm employs various controls for
managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee
and client education and awareness trainings.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems;
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s
processes or systems; Operational Risk includes
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position,
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 145-147 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk,
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page
148, Conduct Risk Management on page 149, Legal Risk
Management on page 150 and Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the
Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications
loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected
services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism,
health emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and
customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency
program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its
critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff,
technology and facilities) in the event of a business
interruption. The program includes governance, awareness
training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as
strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and
manage business interruption and public safety risks. The
strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program
has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s
business operations during and after various events.

72

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions.
The estimation methods are of varying levels of
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,
and making business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the
current and forecasted environment is significantly
different from the historical macroeconomic environments
upon which the models were trained, as the Firm has
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than
in typical periods.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on
pages 74-76 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations
and Model Risk Management section on page 151 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

73

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates
are integral to understanding its reported results. The
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has
established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled,
independently reviewed and applied consistently from
period to period. The methods used and judgments made
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or
liabilities and the related business and risk management
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are
intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit
losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities,

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of
historical loss experience, assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's
2020 Form 10-K for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies
used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses;
and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63–64 and
Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest

effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.

unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices
and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market
and weak overall economic conditions that  affected
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale
lending portfolios. While the economy is showing signs of
improvement, uncertainties remain, including the health of
underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus
strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior
that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors.
Further, significant judgment is still required to estimate
the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit
losses because management considers a wide variety of
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and relative
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
described on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging 2.4% higher
over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021; lower
U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining 2.6% lower
at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of nearly 6.6% in the third quarter of 2021; and
lower national HPI with a peak difference of 17.4% and a
trough in the second quarter of 2022.

74

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of
reasons, including:

• the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse

scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as
of March 31, 2021, and accordingly, the existing
allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario

• the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables

• the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in
the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees
not seen in recent history, which continues to add higher
degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss
estimations

• significant changes in the expected severity and duration

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, effects of government support and customer
assistance, and speed and trajectory of the subsequent
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31, 2021, the Firm
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the
additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse
scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses for these lending exposures, the comparison
between these two scenarios reflects the following
differences:

estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and
appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2021.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including,
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total
reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.9 billion
of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation
based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including
the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

• An increase of approximately $3.6 billion for credit card

loans

• An increase of approximately $2.1 billion for wholesale

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each
business combination is allocated to the related reporting
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill
impairment on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill,
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of
March 31, 2021.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $8.0 billion and $7.7
billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page
154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description
of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated
with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 154-155 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the significant
estimates and judgments associated with establishing
litigation reserves.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment.
The type and level of judgment required is largely
dependent on the amount of observable market information
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using
internally developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more
significant than those required when estimating the fair
value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument
within level 3, management must first determine the
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant
inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable
inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of
fair value for individual financial instruments.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021

Standard

Summary of guidance

Effects on financial statements

Reference Rate
Reform

Issued March
2020 and
updated January
2021

• Provides optional expedients and exceptions to current
accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge
accounting relationships, and other transactions are
amended due to reference rate reform.

• Provides an election to account for certain contract
amendments related to reference rate reform as
modifications rather than extinguishments without the
requirement to assess the significance of the
amendments.

• Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedge

accounting relationship without automatic termination
of that relationship. Provides various practical
expedients and elections designed to allow hedge
accounting to continue uninterrupted during the
transition period.

• Provides a one-time election to transfer securities out
of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria
are met.

• The January 2021 update provides an election to

account for derivatives modified to change the rate
used for discounting, margining, or contract price
alignment (collectively “discounting transition”) as
modifications.

•

Issued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7,
2021 update was effective when issued.

• The Firm elected to apply certain of the practical

expedients related to contract modifications and hedge
accounting relationships, and discounting transition
beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting
transition election was applied retrospectively. The main
purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the
administrative burden of accounting for contracts
impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did
not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances,
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts,
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to differ from
those in the forward-looking statements:

• Economic, financial, reputational and other impacts of the

COVID-19 pandemic;

• Local, regional and global business, economic and political

conditions and geopolitical events;

• Changes in laws and regulatory requirements, including
capital and liquidity requirements affecting the Firm’s
businesses, and the ability of the Firm to address those
requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and

scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices, including
dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws;

• Changes in income tax laws and regulations;

environmental and sustainability concerns that may arise,
including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an economic
slowdown or other economic or market disruption,
including, but not limited to, in the interest rate
environment;

78

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its

counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue products and
services, and the extent to which products or services
previously sold by the Firm require the Firm to incur
liabilities or absorb losses not contemplated at their
initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products and

services by the marketplace and the ability of the Firm to
innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified and

diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,

customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,

disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Changes in applicable accounting policies, including the

introduction of new accounting standards;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of certain

assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or

calamities, including health emergencies, the spread of
infectious diseases, pandemics or outbreaks of hostilities,
or the effects of climate change, and the Firm’s ability to
deal effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its financial,

accounting, technology, data processing and other
operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that may be

caused by any failure of its operational systems or those of
third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself against cyber
attacks and other attempts by unauthorized parties to
access information of the Firm or its customers or to
disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

•

The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part II,
Item 1A: Risk Factors in this form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A:
Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan
Chase does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements. The reader should, however, consult any further
disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firm may make in
any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP
also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when
the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information
on offsetting assets and liabilities.

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities.

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments
have been included such that this interim financial
information is fairly stated.

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current presentation,
including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the
first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred
investment tax credits from accounts payable and other
liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying
value of certain tax-oriented investments. The
reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax
expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with
no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation, including
the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did
not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed
basis.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets,
liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at
fair value and the fair value hierarchy.

(a) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $96.3 billion and $117.6 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-

related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S.
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further

87

discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have
been included in each period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be

classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds,
private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $678 million and $670 million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, were trading assets of $55 million and $52 million, respectively, and other assets of $623 million and $618 million, respectively.
(e) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included within loans were $20.1 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages,

and $6.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans
originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $11.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit
associated with cash collateral.

(g) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.

Level 3 valuations
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for
those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of
such inputs. While the determination to classify an
instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement,
level 3 financial instruments typically include observable
components (that is, components that are actively quoted
and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs
are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages
the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that
are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the
significant groups of instruments within a product/
instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted
averages of the input values presented in the table are
calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that
the input is being used to value.
In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input
uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the
Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-
period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated

balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $397 million, nonagency securities of $32 million and non-trading loans of $562 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $2 million, trading loans of $41 million and non-trading loans of $473 million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $791 million and non-trading loans of $788 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The
significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $968 million, including $280 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is

generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant
both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-

based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs
Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of
the underlying instruments and external market factors that
affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s
positions.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
The following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in
fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. When a
determination is made to classify a financial instrument
within level 3, the determination is based on the
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair

value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments
typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components
that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table
below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or
2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2
risk management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to
such level 3 instruments.

(e) Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue, and were not material for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI, and were $(22) million and $(1.1) billion for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(f) Loan originations are included in purchases.
(g) Includes financial assets and liabilities that have matured, been partially or fully repaid, impacts of modifications, deconsolidations associated with

beneficial interests in VIEs and other items.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes
Level 3 assets at fair value, including assets measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.5% of total Firm
assets at March 31, 2021. The following describes
significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31,
2020, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring
basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis on page 94 for further information
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis.

Three  months ended March 31, 2021
Level 3 assets were $17.4 billion at March 31, 2021,
reflecting  an increase of $952 million from December 31,
2020.

The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021
was predominantly driven by a $1.2 billion increase in
MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair
value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3
into level 2.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, significant
transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:

• $2.1 billion of total debt and equity instruments,

predominantly trading loans, driven by a decrease in
observability.

• $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and

$1.7 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.

All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/
or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in
which they occur.

Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods
indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s
risk management activities where the financial instruments
are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value
measurements rollforward tables on pages 90–93 for
further information on these instruments.

Three months ended March 31, 2021
• $984 million of net gains on assets, driven by MSRs
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates.
Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.

• $528 million of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by

market movements in long-term debt.

Three months ended March 31, 2020

• $1.2 billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net
equity derivative receivables due to market movements
largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment
speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on
MSRs.

• $4.6 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven

by market movements in long-term debt.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives
The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $370 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2021, $316 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.

(b) Of the $303 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2021, $137 million related to residential real estate
loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are
valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with
actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 45% with a weighted average of 26%.

Nonrecurring fair value changes
The following table presents the total change in value of

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in
other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for
private equity direct investments.

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of March
31, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the
periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair
value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2020 was $2.4 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward

and downward carrying value changes.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2021 were $618 million.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2021 were $(340) million.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a
nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa
Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B
common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6228 at March 31, 2021, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on
developments related to the litigation matters.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal,

contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected
life.  The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as
follows for the periods indicated.

guarantees.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without
notice. Refer to page 173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related
commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets,
financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement
volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that
otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted
for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed
on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise

be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

•

Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued as part
of client-driven activities

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are
carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information
presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk
management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI,
while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in
principal transactions revenue were $(2) million for both the three  months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively

managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such
risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid

financial instruments recorded in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected

structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-
protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if

applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value
option was elected was $20.9 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $75 million and $(39)
million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further
information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Derivative instruments
JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients
and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.

The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting
treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited
number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the
type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge
accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are
used to manage risks associated with specified assets and
liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as
derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or
for other purposes.

The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure

same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal
opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained,
amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are
shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown

separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount. Liquid securities represent high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;

• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of

the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

counterparty.

(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $74.6 billion and $88.0 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Net
derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $60.2 billion and $78.4 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Derivative
cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that
contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated
collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered
upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be
triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a
rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in
additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade),
nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the
lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income
The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting
designation or purpose.

Fair value hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well
as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the
Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS

securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net

interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate
swaps and the related hedged items.

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net

realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward

points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-

currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $16.1 billion and $11.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to which

the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income
in future periods.

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not

reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is
$15.5 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value

hedging relationships.

(e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive
(negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of

gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
2020.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $926 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at
March 31, 2021, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated,
the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately
nine years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the
maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated
forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign

exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain
risks associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk
management categories above are included in this
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer
to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk
management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated
in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage
risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities,
including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments,
warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and
foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

and related income.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated

with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These
derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.

(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables
present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary
measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of
the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic
hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold;
the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of
protection sold.

(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays

to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical

reference instrument.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives
and credit-related notes as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.
The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is
based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of
credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile
reflected below.

Allowance for credit losses
Based on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an
allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of
March 31, 2021 and 2020.

HTM securities – credit risk
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the
risk rating assigned to each security. At March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, all HTM securities were rated
investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 97% and 98% rated at least AA+,
respectively.

Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94
million and $19 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM
securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives.
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.

(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency
residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Note 10 – Securities financing activities
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information
regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been
elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities
financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of
the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31,
2021 and December 31, 2020. When the Firm has obtained
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances

outstanding under its securities financing agreements with
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender. In the Consolidated balance sheets, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value
within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities.

(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts

reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty.

agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $12.8 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively, of
securities purchased under resale agreements; $45.5 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $27.4 billion and $14.5 billion,

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting
At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Firm held $603 million and $598 million, respectively, of financial assets for
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in
trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

120

Note 11 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following
categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer
to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.
Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

Consumer, excluding
credit card
• Residential real estate(a)
• Auto and other(b)

Credit card

Wholesale(c)(d)

• Credit card loans

• Secured by real estate
• Commercial and industrial
• Other(e)

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.
(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale

methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral,

purpose, and type of borrower.

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
more information on SPEs.

$13 million and $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Loans (other than those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan

fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools
as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable
requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $7.0 billion and $3.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are

predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards.

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related
commitments (including adjustments to record loans and
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of
cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 was $132 million, of
which $135 million related to loans. Net losses on sales of
loans and lending-related commitments for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 was $(913) million, of
which $(142) million related to loans. In addition, the sale
of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or
changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for
credit losses.

Loan modifications
The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan
modifications have not been considered TDRs because:

•

•

they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan
modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory
guidance, or

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided
by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of
the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not
place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on
nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise
reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected
losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for
credit losses.

Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual
status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would
have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

122

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking
loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit
market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans
secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an
interest-only payment period and certain payment-option
loans that may result in negative amortization.

consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows: current included $40 million and

$36 million; 30–149 days past due included $13 million and $16 million; and 150 or more days past due included $23 million and $24 million at
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(b) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still

within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.

(c) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $36

million and $40 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(d) Includes loans purchased based on the year in which they were originated.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Approximately 35% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because
the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options
available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm

reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by
the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2021, approximately 7%
of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered

collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of
the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $45 million and $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,

respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited
COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged
down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is

insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(i) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.
(j) At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $76 million. These amounts have been

excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the various concessions granted in
modifications of residential real estate loans under the
loss mitigation programs described above and about
redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the
periods presented. The following table presents only the
financial effects of permanent modifications and do not
include temporary concessions offered through trial
modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans
where the sole concession granted is the discharge of
debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions, and
loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option
to suspend the application of accounting guidance for
TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a

payment default in the periods presented, and for which the
payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The
dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the
end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For
residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will
generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type
of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the
last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault
levels.

At March 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated
remaining lives of residential real estate loans
permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The
estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated
prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e.,
foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Loan modifications
Modifications of residential real estate loans where the
Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted
for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm
has elected to apply the option to suspend the application
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the
CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was
$251 million and $142 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There
were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers
whose residential real estate loans have been modified in
TDRs.

Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various concessions to financially
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays
of principal and/or interest payments that would
otherwise have been required under the terms of the
original agreement.

The following table provides information about how
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under
the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter
7 loans where the sole concession granted is the
discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other
insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to
apply the option to suspend the application of accounting
guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a

percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum
of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the
modifications include more than one type of concession.
Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent
with those granted on permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications

and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.

126

Active and suspended foreclosure
At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm
had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured
by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of
$802 million and $846 million, respectively, that were
not included in REO, but were in the process of active or
suspended foreclosure.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has
temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This
could delay recognition of foreclosed properties until the
foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.

(b) At March 31, 2021, included $8.7 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $14.7 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the

PPP. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as
nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.

(c) At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.

127

Loan modifications
Certain other consumer loan modifications are
considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs,
were not material to the Firm for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020. Additional commitments to
lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in
TDRs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
were not material.

Loan modifications
The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification
programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants
concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-
term programs. These modifications involve placing the
customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months,
and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit
card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than
1% of total retained credit card loans.

in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred
within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified
credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients,
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to
small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The
primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the

internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

wholesale loans.

$7.1 billion are included in commercial and industrial, respectively. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA and considered investment-grade. Other than in
certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these
loans.

(b) At December 31, 2020, included $8.0 billion of loans under the PPP, of which $7.4 billion is included in commercial and industrial.
(c) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
more information on SPEs.

(a) The U.S. and non-U.S. distribution is determined based predominantly on the domicile of the borrower.
(b) The credit quality of wholesale loans is assessed primarily through ongoing review and monitoring of an obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations
rather than relying on the past due status, which is generally a lagging indicator of credit quality. Generally excludes loans under payment deferral
programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) Represents loans that are considered well-collateralized and therefore still accruing interest.

(a) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management

framework. As of March 31, 2021, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.

(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically

occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

in partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these
modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the
Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
2020.

Loan modifications
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as
they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or
other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm
has elected to apply the option to suspend the application
of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES
Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.
The carrying value of TDRs was  $1.2 billion and
$954 million as of March 31, 2021, and December 31,
2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was
$428 million  and $76 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The new TDRs for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily
from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that
included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets

133

Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments.
Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and
the related accounting policies.

Allowance for credit losses and related information
The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes
a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s

(a) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans and non-
collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been
placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be
modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) At March 31, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $21.8 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card
portfolio segment; $674.4 billion and $681.4 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $39.6 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively,
for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

(d) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million and $19 million as of

March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

135

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021
decreased when compared to December 31, 2020,
consisting of:

• a $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in

the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential
real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued
improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser
extent portfolio run-off, and

• a $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the

LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic scenarios

While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the
Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not
experienced in recent history, which has created additional
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and
increased the reliance on management judgment. These
challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates
remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during
2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range
of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have
been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately
address these economic circumstances.

Further, despite the improvement in the economy,
uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying
labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains,
and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a
result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in
weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above
eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six
percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP
returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

The following table presents the total unpaid principal
amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has
continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by
the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the
loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests
(including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit
risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements,
and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s
only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The

Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held
$10.9 billion and $13.5 billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively,
which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity
and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk
retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any
agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were
$14.2 billion and $12.2 billion at March 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively, and are reported as off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments in other
unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22
for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments.

Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”)
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party,
refer to page 141 of this Note for further information.
The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s
participation in certain re-securitization transactions,
principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits, and Municipal bond vehicles.

(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include

third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled,
“Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the
general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $4.7 billion and $5.2 billion at
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

VIEs sponsored by third parties
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-
length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance
sheets in the same manner it would record and report
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A
third party is typically the general partner or managing

140

member and has control over the significant activities of the
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by
equity investments and funding commitments, was $23.1
billion and $23.6 billion, of which $8.5 billion and $8.7
billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss
exposure amount has been revised to conform with the
current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its
capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.
Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
further information on affordable housing tax credits and
Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,
the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders
for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to
protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the
power to make decisions that significantly impact the
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to
customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020 was $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. The
fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, was $10.2 billion and $10.5
billion, respectively.

Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans,
including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial
mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting
policies regarding securitizations.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended March 31,

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored
enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to
Ginnie Mae guidelines
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g.,
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share

a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for
additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain
loans due to material breaches of representations and
warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or
had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and
foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage
loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets
as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill
and mortgage servicing rights.

(a) Includes adjustments to goodwill related to the prior period

acquisitions of cxLoyalty in CCB and 55ip in AWM during the fourth
quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for additional information on these acquisitions.

(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.

Goodwill impairment testing
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, or more often if events or
circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business
climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to
Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing,
including the primary method used to estimate the fair
value of the reporting units and the assumptions used in the
goodwill impairment test.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the
future, which could result in a material impairment charge
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the
associated goodwill.

As of March 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed current economic
conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost
of equity, as well as actual business results and projections
of business performance for all its reporting units. The Firm
has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting
units was not impaired as of March 31, 2021, or
December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to
impairment during the three months ended March 31,
2021 or 2020.

143

Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally
declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing
and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage
loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the
MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.

(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and

expected prepayments.

(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a
short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be
linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one
factor may result in changes in another, which would either
magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

Note 20 – Restricted cash and other restricted
assets
Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other
restricted assets.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by
various regulatory authorities based on the particular
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain
restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s
restricted cash:

Firm had the following other restricted assets:

• Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations
for the benefit of customers of $39.2 billion and $37.2
billion, respectively.

• Securities with a fair value of $8.6 billion and $1.3

billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to
customer activity.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital,
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to
these capital requirements established by their respective
primary regulators.

The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries
were subject as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020.

CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios each include a
respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as
calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3% SCB for Basel III Standardized
ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III
Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by
the federal banking agencies.

(b) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as

supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for
BHC and IDI subsidiaries, respectively.

(c) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed
capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to
the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB
surcharge.

(d) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to

regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.

(e) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations

issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.

CECL regulatory capital transition delay
As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule
that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to
delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning
January 1, 2022.

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31,
2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion,

which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings
and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for
credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances
on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have
also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average
assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 27 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information
on CECL capital transition provisions.

The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was
subject.

(a) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that

are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly goodwill and other intangible assets.

(b) JPMorgan Chase’s total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR, excludes on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits
at Federal Reserve Banks, as provided by the interim final rule issued by the Federal Reserve which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect
through March 31, 2021. On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and
remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions.
As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this exclusion.

(c) The capital metrics reflect the CECL capital transition provisions. Additionally, loans originated under the PPP receive a zero percent risk weight.

Note 22 – Off–balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees, and other
commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The
contractual amount of these financial instruments
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most
of these commitments and guarantees have historically
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the
Firm’s related accounting policies.

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments
is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments.

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments
at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts
in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain
scored business banking lending-related commitments
represent the total available credit for these products. The
Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all
available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card
and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as
permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60
days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of
the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower.

(d) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $61 million and $72 million,

respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees; and $597 million and $357 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments
are shown gross of risk participations.

(e) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $314.3 billion
and $264.3 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and
government agencies.

(f) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program

and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(g) At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, unfunded commitments

related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, and letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis.

(h) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(i) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-

related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

153

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally
consist of commitments for working capital and general
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of
credit.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings,
trade financings and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 11 for further information on internal risk ratings.

Merchant charge-backs
Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as
a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for
disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that
result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is
resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will
(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the
amount to the cardholder and will charge back the
transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable
to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services
will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the
cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant
Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-
backs.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to
Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on these derivatives.

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying
as guarantees as of March 31, 2021, and December 31,
2020.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives
market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are
breached by the Firm.

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.

Sponsored member repo program
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become
sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also
guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and
performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective
obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its
liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house
therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments
line on page 153. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and
no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 153 of
this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for additional information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral
Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral.

Pledged assets
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets
pledged.

The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

Collateral
The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is
permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This
collateral is generally obtained under resale and other
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 24 – Litigation

Contingencies
As of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and
affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or
respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including
private, civil litigations and regulatory/government
investigations. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve
both formal and informal proceedings, by both
governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
These legal proceedings are at varying stages of
adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each
of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and
a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and
contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel
legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to
approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021. This
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
was based upon information available as of that date for
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses
involves significant judgment, given:

•

•

•

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in
preliminary stages,

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability
(if any) has yet to be determined,

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the
proceedings, including issues regarding class
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential
outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm
has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the
court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities,
and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may
vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings.

Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is
investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection
with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore
funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into
residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali
Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil
claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by
home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to
deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have
been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017
pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In
July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order
making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other
parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and
the offshore funds that had invested in the projects,
violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”)
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May
2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional
attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings
freezing approximately $25 million held by JPMorgan India
Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred
to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A
separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA
violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the investigation.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major
international oil companies. The account held
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in
accordance with directions received from its clients. In
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”)
commenced a claim in the English High Court for
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the
accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the
FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a
complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on
notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was
unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been
scheduled to commence in February 2022.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm
previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and
trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded

156

guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In
January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment
entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in
January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with
the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the
probation period. The Department of Labor granted the
Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows
the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the
Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until
January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course
for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-
year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition
Commission matter is the remaining FX-related
governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the
South Africa Competition Tribunal.

In August 2018, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York granted final approval to the
Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of
federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to
manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought
damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures
and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement
class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the
class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm
and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A
number of these actions remain pending. Further, a
putative class action has been filed against the Firm and
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain
consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly
inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought
against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on
behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments.
In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and
11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10
million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative
class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct
have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel
and Australia.

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks,
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases
for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card
interchange, and modifications to certain credit card
network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that
settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York for further proceedings consistent with the
appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into two separate
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the
parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized

an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior
settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the
defendants collectively contributed an additional $900
million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in
escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019,
the amended agreement was approved by the District
Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s
approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on
the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with
the settlement agreement. The class action seeking
primarily injunctive relief continues separately.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as
well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those
actions remain pending.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
("BBA") London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,
continues. In December 2016, the European Commission
issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding
an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to
EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with
the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along
with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District
Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm,
to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have
appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging
that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an
unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired
to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans
and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a
motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin
defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit
defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that
rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Defendants opposed that motion,
which remains pending. The Firm’s settlements of putative

157

class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore
Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate,
and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain
subject to court approval.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and
Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/
or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions
with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which,
collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective
investigations relating to historical trading practices by
former employees in the precious metals and U.S.
treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to
2016.

The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
(“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a
criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with
two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain
terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms
of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after
three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully
comply with all of their obligations.

Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the
total monetary amount includes victim compensation
payments.

Several putative class action complaints have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Firm and certain former employees,
alleging a precious metals futures and options price
manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the
General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019,
and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In
Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class
action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying
conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative
class actions have been filed in the United States District
Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern
District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation
of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims
under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the
complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the
Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the
Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed
their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021.

 Two putative class action complaints have also been filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United

States District Court for the Eastern District of New York
against the Firm and certain individual defendants on
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the
putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the
Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not
disclose certain information relating to the above-
referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these
putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed
their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime,
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York.  The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust
law and New York State common law in connection with an
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous
exchange trading for securities lending transactions.
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which
defendants are opposing.

Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have
been investigating a series of transactions entered into by
senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”)
during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure
their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a
number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase
cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges
issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016,
referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal
correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January
2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling
the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court
of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September
2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an
ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the
annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. The
Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power
to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the
Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the
managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal
correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify
whether a further investigation should be opened against
JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In
April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear
JPMorgan Chase’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of
the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In
addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil
proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims
are separate, involve different allegations and are at
various stages of proceedings.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has

158

meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may
be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves,
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on
management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $28 million and
$197 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the
Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the
future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material
legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating
results for a particular period, depending on, among other
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

159

Note 25 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major
reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are
determined based on the products and services provided, or
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in
which financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented
on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and
Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments.

Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
segment results as of or for the three months ended March
31, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm’s
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to

Segment results and reconciliation(a)

present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on
capital allocation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the
“Firm”) as of March 31, 2021, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, including the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim
financial statements”).  Based on our reviews, we are not
aware of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them to
be in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of
the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year
then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated
February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing
a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on
certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial
statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results
These interim financial statements are the responsibility of
the Firm’s management.  We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.  We conducted our review in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB.  A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical
procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

through the commercial card products. Services include
procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense
management services, and business-to-business payment
solutions.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include,
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to
the protection seller for the difference between the face

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However,
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate
loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between
the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of
the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data
where actual data is not available. As a result, the
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values;
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise
and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to present
revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management
also uses this financial measure at the segment level,
because it believes this provides information to enable
investors to understand the underlying operational
performance and trends of the particular business segment
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with
the performance of competitors.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral
or margin when due).

Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities
without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Merchant Services: offers merchants payment processing
capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics,
and other payments services. Through Merchant Services,
merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and
debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.

MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis

MMLF: Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility

MMMF: Money market mutual funds

Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than
subprime loans but have characteristics that would
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A
lending characteristics may include one or more of the
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio;
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv)
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-
rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date
triggers.

165

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have
reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v)
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period
presented.

NAV: Net Asset Value

Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained
loans for the reporting period.

Net interchange income includes the following
components:

•

Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit
card issuers on sales transactions.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by
cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs
generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for
interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all
sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S.
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and
interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more
unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically
maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only
exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-based
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase
grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees
under its share-based compensation programs, which
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested
awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under
the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock
and participating securities, based on their respective rights
to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition
have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in
credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.

PD: Probability of default
Phishing: a type of social engineering cyberattack received
through email or online messages.
PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small
Business Association ("SBA")

PPPL Facility: Paycheck Protection Program Lending
Facility

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a
lending institution to generate income in excess of its
provision for credit losses.

166

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer
spread, which is the difference between the price at which
the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and
the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument.
It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or
termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and
unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and
losses on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in
client-driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven market-
making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity
instruments, derivatives and commodities (including
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments
that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue
also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships
(primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign
exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk
management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

PSU(s): Performance share units

RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive

approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized,
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-
weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III
Advanced.

Scored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that
predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit
card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small
business loans.

S&P: Standard and Poors

SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights

SCB: Stress capital buffer

reference pool of loans or other market variables. The notes
typically contain embedded (but not separable or
detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates
or indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are
currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss
mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results,
the total net revenue for each of the business segments and
the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax

167

credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities; the corresponding income tax
impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within
income tax expense.

TBVPS: Tangible book value per share

TCE: Tangible common equity

TDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur
when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank
funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over
various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds.

A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating
is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of
industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar
rating” is derived from a weighted average of the
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-
year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the
individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is
based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated and

170

hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive this
analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The
data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S.
dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share
class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share
class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds
except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund
level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar,
denotes the share class recommended as being the best
proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most
retail version (based upon annual management charge,
minimum investment, currency and other factors). The
performance data could have been different if all funds/
accounts would have been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and
five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis
are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile
rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each
fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values
into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund
performance and associated peer rankings at the share
class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share
class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K.,
Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for
all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by
Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as
being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will
be the most retail version (based upon annual management
charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors).
Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more
than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are
included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to
“Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only).
The performance data could have been different if all
funds/accounts would have been included. Past
performance is not indicative of future results.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.

Refer to the Market Risk Management section of
Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 135–142
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of the Firm’s management, including its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and
31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of
internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless,
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls
may occur from time to time, and there can be no
assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal
control in the future and collateral consequences
therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting” on page 158 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was
no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three
months ended March 31, 2021, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II – Other Information

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal
proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information
that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3:
Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion supplements the discussion of risk
factors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:
Risk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented,
sets forth the material risk factors that could affect
JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations.
Readers should not consider any descriptions of such
factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could
affect the Firm.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing
significant harm to the global economy and could further
negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus
disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led
to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place
requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other
countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global
economic conditions, including:

•

•

•

significant disruption and volatility in the financial
markets

significant disruption of global supply chains, and

closures of many businesses, leading to loss of
revenues and increased unemployment.

A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the
emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar
effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global
economy.

The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic
have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses and results of operations, including:

•

•

reduction in demand for certain products and services
from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting
in lower revenue, and

increases in the allowance for credit losses.

Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with
the determination of the allowance for credit losses have
heightened performance risk in the economic environment
precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and
government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even
after adjustments have been made to model outputs,
JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses
arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from
these developments.

172

A prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have
other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses, results of operations and financial condition,
including:

•

recognition of credit losses and further increases in the
allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that
businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at
elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their
lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate
from metropolitan areas

• material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives
and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase
owns or in which it makes markets

•

•

•

downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings

constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels
of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”)
related to supporting client activities, downgrades in
client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors,
any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to
take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise
would under its liquidity and capital management
strategies, and

the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan
Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively,
including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-
place arrangements, government actions or other
restrictions in connection with the pandemic.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations
and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and
liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the
ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the
effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by
governmental authorities and other third parties in
response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including
the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed

because of the impact of prior and potential future
government stimulus actions or payment assistance
provided to clients and customers.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or
indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or
by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed
to support individuals, households and businesses impacted
by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase
to:

•

•

•

increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny

negative publicity, and

increased exposure to litigation,

any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of
operations and financial condition, it may also have the
effect of heightening many of the other risks described in
Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Supervision and regulation
Refer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 3–
7 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for information on
Supervision and Regulation.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds.

The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity
securities during the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Repurchases under the common share repurchase
program
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of this
Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases under the
Firm’s common share repurchase program.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share
repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized
a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and
common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net
income for the four preceding calendar quarters. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through
at least the second quarter of 2021.
Shares repurchased pursuant to the common share repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2021,
were as follows.
