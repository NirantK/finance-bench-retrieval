PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell
Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June 30, 2000 following
our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 144,500 employees.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).

We  have  two  reportable  segments,  Wireless  and  Wireline,  which  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  and  organize  by  products  and  services,  and  customer
groups, respectively.

Wireless

Wireline

Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and
government customers across the United States (U.S.).

Wireline’s communications products and enhanced services include video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network
services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and
government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.

In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. We continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.

Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the headings "Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  -  Overview  and  -  Segment  Results  of  Operations"  and  in  Note 13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Verizon
Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.

Wireless

Background

Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
U.S. Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the U.S. as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2018, Verizon Wireless had 118.0
million retail connections and 2018 revenues of approximately $91.7 billion, representing approximately 70% of Verizon’s aggregate revenues.

Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as "Verizon Wireless" in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc
(Vodafone)  and  Bell  Atlantic  as  partners,  following  Vodafone’s  contribution  of  its  U.S.  wireless  assets  into  Cellco.  We  acquired  all  of  Vodafone’s  indirect  45%  interest  in
Verizon Wireless in 2014, which resulted in full ownership of Verizon Wireless.

Wireless Service and Product Offerings

Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand, customers that obtain wireless products and services that operate on
our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis and customers that utilize Internet of Things (IoT) services via our network.

Wireless Services

We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis.
Retail  (non-wholesale)  postpaid  accounts  primarily  represent  retail  customers  with  Verizon  Wireless  that  are  directly  served  and  managed  by  Verizon  Wireless  and  use  its
branded  services.  A  single  account  may  include  monthly  wireless  services  for  a  variety  of  connected  devices.  A  retail  postpaid  connection  represents  an  individual  line  of
service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services.
Approximately 96% of our total retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2018. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services
without credit verification by paying for all services in advance.

We offer various postpaid account service plans, including unlimited plans, shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers.
Our  unlimited  plans,  available  to  our  consumer  and  business  customers,  offer,  among  other  things,  unlimited  domestic  voice,  data  and  texting.  Our  unlimited  plans  allow
customers to mix and match plans by line, with different benefits and inclusions beyond just traditional data access, voice and text. Our shared data plans typically feature
unlimited domestic voice, unlimited domestic and

3

Table of Contents

international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customer’s account. This allowance will vary
from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. Customers on certain fixed-data plans may carry over unused data allowances to the
next billing period, or stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. Our unlimited and shared data plans include High Definition
(HD) Voice and Video Calling on compatible devices, and certain plans offer additional services, such as Mobile Hotspot services and free roaming in Canada and Mexico on
compatible devices. Our HD Voice services, enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), deliver calls over our fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, and our
Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that can provide
Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. Our unlimited plans provide customers the ability to stream DVD or HD quality videos, based on the service plan. We also
offer various voice and shared data plans for business customers.

As  of  January  2017,  we  no  longer  offer  consumers  new  fixed-term  subsidized  service  plans  for  phones;  however,  we  continue  to  offer  subsidized  plans  to  our  business
customers, and we also continue to service existing fixed-term subsidized plans for consumers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device
payment program.

We also offer prepaid connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice and unlimited domestic and international text. We have both single line and multi-line
family options, with individual line data plan selections ranging from 500 megabytes per month to unlimited data. Family prepaid accounts include a line discount based on the
number of total lines. On compatible devices, our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, HD Voice and Video Calling. Our metered prepaid plans include
Mobile Hotspot services and allow customers to continue to access our data services at reduced data speeds after using their monthly allowance for 4G LTE high speed data.
None of our prepaid plans require an annual contract or credit check.

Our international travel wireless services allow our customers to access voice, text and data services on many of our "World" smartphones, tablets or basic phones from various
international destinations, dependent upon the customer's wireless plan. With TravelPass, customers are able to use their domestic talk, text and data allowances while traveling
in Mexico, Canada and other countries where TravelPass is available for a flat rate per day.

Access  to  the  Internet  is  available  on  all  smartphones  and  nearly  all  basic  phones.  In  addition,  our  customers  can  access  the  Internet  at  broadband  speeds  on  notebook
computers and tablets that are either wireless enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.

We also provide network access needed to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with various companies that purchase network access from us to connect their
Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users.

Wireless Equipment

We offer several categories of wireless equipment, including a variety of smartphone and other handsets, wireless-enabled Internet devices, such as tablets, laptop computers
and netbooks and other wireless enabled connected devices, such as smart watches and other wearables, and our Hum product.

Distribution

We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services.

Our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers
and local, regional and national business customers. Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. Our "Next Gen Design" retail stores focus on
our customer's evolving digital lifestyle.

Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet.
The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with
high-profile national retailers, which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services, and with various convenience store chains, which sell our prepaid products
and services.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc.,
as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for
resale,  including  resellers  that  buy  from  us.  Competition  remains  intense  as  a  result  of  high  rates  of  smartphone  penetration  in  the  wireless  market,  increased  network
investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional premium
content, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-
alone  wireless  service  providers  merge  or  transfer  licenses  to  larger,  better  capitalized  wireless  service  providers  and  as  mobile  virtual  network  operators  resell  wireless
communication services.

The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue
with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc., Apple
Inc.  and  others  are  offering  alternative  means  for  making  wireless  voice  calls  that,  in  certain  cases,  can  be  used  in  lieu  of  the  wireless  provider’s  voice  service,  as  well  as
alternative means of accessing video content.

Table of Contents

We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We consider a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the
U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content,
have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers
must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that the depth and breadth of our network
provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace.

Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape, with plans that address both the postpaid and prepaid customer. As
the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include voice services,
data  access  and  text  messaging,  in  some  cases  on  an  unlimited  basis.  Many  other  wireless  service  providers  have  also  bundled  wireless  service  offerings  with  other
products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless. We and other wireless service providers, as well as
equipment manufacturers, also offer device payment options, which provide consumers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing
arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have also become more common in a highly penetrated market in order to gain share of subscribers interested in
changing carriers.

Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless
providers.  Our  customer  service,  retention  and  satisfaction  programs  are  based  on  providing  customers  with  convenient  and  easy-to-use  products  and  services  and
focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. To promote long-term relationships with our customers, we launched the Verizon
Up program, which offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related transactions with Verizon Wireless.
The program offers customers discounts on products, services and access to experiences, such as sporting events, shows and concerts.

Product  and  service  development.  As  wireless  technologies  develop  and  wireless  broadband  networks  proliferate,  continued  customer  and  revenue  growth  will  be
increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and
innovative  wireless  products  and  services  both  independently  and  in  collaboration  with  application  and  content  providers.  We  also  collaborate  with  various  device
manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over
the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base. In addition, as the
price for smartphones has continued to increase in the market, our device protection services have grown in importance for consumers.

Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining
the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We strive to increase
sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network
of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds.
In  addition,  we  sell  network  access  to  both  traditional  resellers,  which  resell  network  services  to  their  end-users,  and  to  various  companies  to  enable  wireless
communications for their IoT devices or services.

Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant
capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations to enable continued investment.

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry. These include the factors described above, as well as new
technologies,  new  business  models,  changes  in  customer  preferences,  regulatory  changes,  demographic  trends,  economic  conditions  and  pricing  strategies  that  bundle  the
services of wireless and cable competitors.

Strategic Transaction

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the
towers  from  American  Tower  for  a  minimum  of  10 years  at  current  market  rates,  with  options  to  renew.  Under  the  terms  of  the  lease  agreements,  American  Tower  has
exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire
these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion.

See "Network and Technology - Spectrum" for additional information regarding the NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) and Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path)
strategic transactions related to the Wireless segment.

Wireline

Background

Our Wireline  segment  provides  communications  products  and  enhanced  services,  including  video  and  data  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed
network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government
customers both in the U.S. and around the world. In 2018, Wireline revenues were $29.8 billion, representing approximately 23% of Verizon’s aggregate revenues.

To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business around a fiber-based network
supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We continue to seek ways to increase revenue,
further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform
that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our "multi-use fiber" Intelligent Edge Network initiative will create opportunities to generate revenue
from fiber-based services in our Wireline business.

Wireline Service and Product Offerings

We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings - Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and
Business Markets.

Consumer Markets

Consumer Markets provides residential fixed connectivity solutions, including Internet, TV and voice services. We provide these services over our 100% fiber-optic network
under  the  brand  "Fios"  and  over  a  traditional  copper-based  network  to  customers  who  are  not  served  by  Fios.  In  2018,  Consumer  Markets  revenues  were  $12.6  billion,
representing approximately 42% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues.

Internet services. We offer our Fios customers fast and reliable 100% fiber-optic Internet connectivity. As customers connect more devices in their home and stream more high
definition video, the need for a fast and reliable Internet connection is growing. In 2017, we introduced our Gigabit Connection in the marketplace, offering speeds of up to 940
Mbps on download and 880 Mbps on upload. As additional cloud-based applications are introduced, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream
bandwidth performance that matches what they already receive for download. In other areas of our footprint where Fios service is not available, we offer high speed Internet
(HSI) using Digital Subscriber Line technology.

Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2018,  Fios  video  services  were  available  to  homes  across  9  states,  as  well  as  the
District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including

•

•

•

•

Fios Custom TV, which provides customers with seven distinct package offerings. Each package includes the local versions of the major broadcast stations and other
similar local content and then adds on more than 45 specialty channels driven by popular viewership choices;

Fios  Traditional  TV,  which  provides  customers  with  a  variety  of  package  offerings.  The  most  basic  package  offering  includes  more  than  15  channels  including  core
networks while the other packages all include access to more than 280 channels.

Fios on Demand, which gives Fios customers the ability to watch content virtually anytime and anywhere, on any compatible device. Customers who subscribe to Fios
Internet and video services also have the ability to upload their photos, music and videos to their personal Fios on Demand Library, which gives them access to this
content via various data-capable devices.

Fios Multi-Room DVR, which provides customers the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home.

We continue to develop and enhance our video platform to maintain driving engagement and improving the customer experience.

Voice services. We offer voice services on our fiber and copper networks, providing local, long distance, and calling features.

Enterprise Solutions

Enterprise Solutions helps customers transform their businesses to compete in the digital economy, with solutions that adapt to increasingly dynamic needs for connectivity,
security and collaboration. With the accelerating pace of digital transformation, mitigating risk, maintaining business continuity, and capitalizing on data to create personalized
experiences are key priorities for global enterprise companies. Enterprise Solutions offers traditional circuit-based network products and services and advanced networking
solutions,  including  Private  Internet  Protocol  (IP),  Ethernet,  and  Software-Defined  Wide  Area  Network  (SD-WAN),  and  cyber  security  services,  along  with  our  traditional
voice  services,  and  advanced  workforce  productivity  and  customer  contact  center  solutions.  In  2018,  Enterprise  Solutions  revenues  were  $8.8  billion,  representing
approximately 30% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues.

Networks.  We  offer  a  robust  portfolio  of  network  connectivity  products  to  help  our  enterprise  and  business  customers  connect  with  their  employees,  partners,  vendors,
customers and, for our government customers, their constituents.

Internet. We  offer  our  enterprise  and  business  customers  the  ability  to  connect  to  the  Internet  via  our  Fios  Internet  and  our  dedicated  Internet  access  services,  which
provide extensive bandwidth, configuration and billing options designed to address specific business needs.

Private Networks. Our private networking services connect multiple business locations securely through our Private IP and Ethernet services, generally via fiber-optic
based connectivity. Point to point connectivity via Ethernet or Wavelength is also available.

Virtual  and  Software  Defined  Networks.  We  provide  our  enterprise  and  business  customers  with  the  ability  to  leverage  the  power  of  Software  Defined  Networking
technologies, such as SD-WAN or Virtual Network Services (VNS), with easily ordered and deployed "on demand" capabilities. These services can function "over the
top" of our network or those of other carriers, enabling significant customer flexibility, advanced security options and digital/software enablement of their network.

Advanced Communications Services. We offer a suite of services to our enterprise and business customers to help them communicate with their employees, partners, vendors,
constituents and customers.

Voice over IP (VoIP). Our VoIP services enable communications via our managed IP based communications services for enterprise and business customers that seek a
hosted IP communications/phone system or an IP based telephony service for on-premise phone systems or private branch exchanges (PBX).

Unified  Communications  &  Collaboration  (UC&C).  Our  UC&C  services,  an  expansion  of  our  VoIP  services,  provide  our  business  customers  with  unified  tools  for
communications and collaboration, such as instant messaging and presence, and audio, video and web conferencing.

Customer  Experience/Contact  Center.  We  offer  our  business  customers  the  ability  to  deliver  integrated  support  services  to  their  own  customers,  employees  or
constituents. Hosted and on-premise versions are available, which include the ability to support remote agents and integration with our business customer’s back office
systems and tools.

Security services. We offer a suite of management and data security services to help our enterprise, business and government customers protect, detect and respond to security
threats to their networks, data, applications and infrastructure.

Core  services.  Core  services  include  core  voice  and  data  services,  which  consist  of  a  comprehensive  portfolio  of  domestic  and  global  solutions  utilizing  traditional
telecommunications  technology.  Voice  services  include  local  exchange,  regional,  long  distance  and  toll-free  calling  along  with  voice  messaging  services,  conferencing  and
contact center solutions. Core data includes private line and data access networks. Core services also include the provision of customer premises equipment, and installation,
maintenance and site services. We continue to transition customers out of copper-based legacy voice and data services to fiber services, including IP and Ethernet.

Partner Solutions

Partner Solutions provides communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use
our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2018, Partner Solutions revenues were $4.7 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues. A
portion of Partner Solutions revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us.

Partner Solutions provides the following key services to both Wireless and Wireline carriers:

Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their end-
users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core time-division multiplexing (TDM)
data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support
their private networks. We have also launched a dark fiber product for wireless carriers as demand for wireless data continues to grow and dark fiber plays a larger role in their
network architecture.

Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide
originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing our TDM and VoIP networks.

Local  services.  We  offer  an  array  of  local  dial  tone  and  broadband  services  to  competitive  local  exchange  carriers,  some  of  which  are  offered  to  comply  with
telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations.

Business Markets

Business Markets offers tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, IP Networking, advanced voice solutions, security, and managed information technology (IT)
services  to  U.S.-based  small  and  medium  businesses,  state  and  local  governments,  and  educational  institutions.  In  2018,  Business  Markets  revenues  were  $3.4  billion,
representing approximately 11% of Wireline’s aggregate revenues.

The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional and non-traditional participants seeking increased
market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television
companies, Internet service providers, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.

In  addition,  companies  with  a  global  presence  increasingly  compete  with  our  wireline  businesses.  A  relatively  small  number  of  telecommunications  and  integrated  service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large
contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.

We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry:

•

•

•

•

•

Bandwidth  (speed)  and  network  reliability.  Consumers  and  small  business  customers  seek  fast  and  reliable  connections  for  entertainment,  communications  and
productivity.  As  Internet  use  increases,  so  do  bandwidth  requirements,  both  downstream  and  upstream.  We  and  other  network-based  providers  must  ensure  that  our
networks  can  meet  these  increasing  bandwidth  requirements.  In  addition,  network  reliability  and  security  are  increasingly  important  competitive  factors  for  our
Enterprise  Solutions  and  Business  Markets  customers,  which  include  state  and  local  government  and  education  (SLED)  customers  and  small  and  medium  business
(SMB) customers. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide reliable and secure networks.

Pricing.  Cable  operators,  telecommunications  companies  and  integrated  service  providers  use  pricing  to  capture  market  share  from  incumbents.  Pricing  is  also  a
significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based
voice and video calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.

Customer service.  Customers  expect  industry-leading  service  from  their  service  providers.  As  technologies  and  services  evolve,  the  ability  to  excel  in  this  area  is
important  for  customer  acquisition  and  retention.  For  our  Consumer  Markets  and  Business  Markets  customers,  we  compete  in  this  area  through  our  service
representatives  and  online  support.  We  provide  our  Enterprise  Solutions  customers  with  ready  access  to  their  system  and  performance  information  and  we  conduct
proactive  testing  of  our  network  to  identify  issues  before  they  affect  their  customers.  In  our  Partner  Solutions  business,  service  improvement  is  achieved  through
continued system automation initiatives.

Product differentiation. As  a  result  of  pricing  pressures,  providers  need  to  differentiate  their  products  and  services.  Customers  are  shifting  their  focus  from  access  to
applications  and  are  seeking  ways  to  leverage  their  broadband  and  video  connections.  Converged  features,  such  as  integrated  wireless  and  wireline  functionality,  are
becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.

Innovation. The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and
refine their product portfolio and customer service experience and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers.

In the Consumer Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital
products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include Fios Internet, TV, and voice services and we have introduced market offers targeted to
our Verizon Wireless customers. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.

Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. We expect
the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.

We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless
companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet
portal providers.

In the Enterprise Solutions market, competition remains high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system
integrators,  carriers,  and  hardware  and  software  providers.  In  addition,  some  of  the  largest  IT  services  companies  are  making  strategic  acquisitions,  divesting  non-strategic
assets or forging new alliances to improve cost structure and focus on solutions which are growth catalysts for technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have
focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than by the use of in-
house  machines.  Carriers  have  also  utilized  acquisitions  to  make  significant  inroads  into  enterprise  outsourcing  markets  that  have  long  been  dominated  by  the  major  IT
outsourcers.

Our Partner Solutions business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for
wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity.

In Business Markets, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with a consumer-like "look and feel" are becoming key
differentiators  for  both  our  SMB  and  SLED  customers.  SMB  customers  are  seeking  full  life-cycle  offers  that  simplify  the  process  of  starting,  running  and  growing  their
businesses,  while  SLED  customers  want  similar  services  that  are  high  quality  and  secure,  and  that  enable  material  improvement  in  citizen  outreach,  public  safety  and  city
infrastructure performance.

Strategic Transactions

In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet
and  video  customers,  switched  and  special  access  lines  and  high-speed  Internet  service  and  long  distance  voice  accounts  in  these  three  states  to  Frontier  Communications
Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6
billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange
carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless.

The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier.

In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix, Inc. (Equinix) pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments (Data Center Sale). The transaction closed in
May 2017.

In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and
Ethernet  networks  in  the  U.S.  Concurrently,  we  entered  into  a  separate  agreement  to  utilize  certain  wireless  spectrum  from  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  XO  Holdings,
NextLink, that held its wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of
XO for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5 billion, of which $0.1 billion was paid in 2015.

In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments, of which $0.3 billion was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment.

In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW!), a leading
provider  of  communications  services.  The  transaction  closed  in  December  2017.  In  addition,  the  parties  entered  into  a  separate  agreement  pursuant  to  which  WOW!  will
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately $0.3 billion, of which $0.2 billion was  received  in
December 2017.

Additional information regarding these strategic transactions is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

Network and Technology

Wireless

Our primary network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G
technologies. In addition, over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and
mobile 5G wireless services.

Our 4G LTE network is available in approximately 500 markets covering approximately 331 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America
partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network assets and our core
4G LTE equipment and 700 megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. We currently have 21 LTE in Rural America partners that provide
4G LTE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people.

We use HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, in addition to 3G Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers.

We  consider  the  reliability,  coverage  and  speed  of  our  wireless  network  as  key  factors  for  our  continued  success  and  we  strive  to  provide  our  customers  with  the  highest
network  reliability  for  their  wireless  services.  We  believe  that  steady  and  consistent  network  and  platform  investments  provide  the  foundation  for  innovative  products  and
services that will fuel profitable growth.

Table of Contents

We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of
large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and
completed without being dropped. We have been densifying  our 4G LTE network by utilizing small cell  technology,  in-building  solutions  and  distributed  antenna  systems.
Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services, but also
positions us for the deployment of 5G technology. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer
experience. We have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates.

Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we
have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In
addition,  we  have  a  fleet  of  portable  backup  generators  that  can  be  deployed,  if  needed.  We  further  enhance  reliability  by  using  a  fully  redundant  Multiprotocol  Label
Switching backbone network in critical locations.

In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in
nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming
arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the U.S. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months’ notice;
however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Spectrum

The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC)  to  provide  these  wireless  services  on  portions  of  the  800  MHz  band,  also  known  as  cellular  spectrum,  the  1800-1900  MHz  band,  also  known  as  Personal
Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively,
cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. This spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum.

In addition to our low and mid-band spectrum, we have spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 Gigahertz (GHz) band, collectively called millimeter-wave spectrum. In 2017, we
entered into transactions to acquire NextLink and Straight Path, each of which held millimeter-wave spectrum licenses. The NextLink acquisition closed in January 2018 and
the Straight Path acquisition closed in February 2018. The spectrum acquired as part of these transactions is being used for our 5G technology deployment.

In  January  2015,  the  FCC  completed  an  auction  of  65  MHz  of  spectrum  in  the  AWS-3  band.    We  participated  in  that  auction  and  were  the  high  bidder  on  181  spectrum
licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015.

We  are  aggressively  refarming  3G  bands  on  800  MHz  and  PCS  bands  for  4G  LTE  use.  We  anticipate  that  we  will  need  additional  spectrum  to  meet  future  demand.  This
increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of
speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from
other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. On November 14, 2018, the FCC started two sequential
millimeter wave auctions. Verizon is an applicant in the FCC's Auction 101 and Auction 102 relating to millimeter wave spectrum. On January 24, 2019, the FCC announced
that Auction 101 had concluded with a total of approximately $702.6 million in bids received for the licenses that were won. The FCC has stated that it will not, and it will not
permit  any  applicant  to,  disclose  the  winning  bidders  of  any  of  the  licenses  in  Auction  101  until  Auction  102  concludes.  In  addition,  the  FCC  has  indicated  that  a  third
millimeter wave auction will begin in the second half of 2019, and the auction for Priority Access Licenses in the Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) 3.5 GHz band
may also begin in 2019. In addition to spectrum, we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies.

From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue
similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps
designed  to  increase  the  amount  of  contiguous  spectrum  within  frequency  bands  in  a  specific  market.  Contiguous  spectrum  improves  network  performance  and  efficiency.
These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.

Additional  information  regarding  spectrum  license  transactions  is  included  in  the  2018  Verizon  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

5G Deployment

We believe 5G technology can provide users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility, connected devices,
energy  efficiency,  service  deployment,  latency  and  reliability.  In  late  2015,  we  launched  the  Verizon  5G  Technology  Forum  with  key  industry  partners  to  develop  5G
requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current
4G LTE technology, lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. During 2018, we commercially launched
5G Home, our alternative to wired home broadband, on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets; Sacramento, Los Angeles, Houston and Indianapolis. We are the first

10

Table of Contents

company  to  bring  5G  broadband  Internet  service  to  consumers  and  we  expect  to  expand  coverage  as  we  transition  to  global  standards  equipment  in  2019.  In  addition,  we
expect to launch mobile 5G services in 2019 as compatible devices become available.

Network Equipment and Build-Out

As  we  continue  to  build  and  upgrade  our  existing  4G  LTE  network  and  deploy  our  5G  network,  we  must  complete  a  variety  of  steps,  including  securing  rights  to  a  large
number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a
similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide
variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of
our existing leased and owned tower sites.

Wireline

Fios

Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued
emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data
speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost-effective
and  efficient  manner.  Our  PON  technology  provides  the  flexibility  to  adapt  our  network  to  deliver  increased  data  speeds  and  new  services  without  major  overhauls  or
replacements to the fiber-optic infrastructure.

While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses
increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.

Global IP

Verizon  owns  and  operates  one  of  the  largest  global  fiber  networks  in  the  world,  providing  connectivity  to  business  customers  in  more  than  150  countries.  Our  global  IP
network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations.

Global business is rapidly evolving to an "everything-as-a-service" model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via
managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that
combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands.

We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments,
will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential, SMB, government and enterprise customers.

Intelligent Edge Network

We are evolving our network architecture to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing
services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that the new network architecture
will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to
homes and businesses, and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market.

Media

Background

Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. Our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in
2018 under the "Oath" brand, includes diverse media and technology brands that serve the global community using powerful technology, trusted content and differentiated
data.  Our  strategy  is  built  on  providing  consumers  with  owned  and  operated  search  properties  and  finance,  news,  sports  and  entertainment  offerings  and  providing  other
businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising platforms. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global
platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an
opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers.

Strategic Transactions

In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOL’s business model aligns with our approach, and we believe
that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams.

In June 2017, we completed our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Additional
discussion of the transaction is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc.
and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

We have established relationships with leading sports leagues to bring compelling content to our customers across our digital platforms. In December 2017, we entered into a
multi-year partnership with the National Football League (NFL) in which Verizon’s portfolio of premium digital and mobile media properties, such as Yahoo Sports, stream in-
market  and  national  games,  including  national  pre-season,  regular  season  and  playoff  games,  and  the  Super  Bowl,  to  mobile  phones.  In  January  2018,  we  entered  into  an
innovative, multi-year partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) that will deliver one of the most comprehensive video streaming offerings of NBA content -
from live out-of-market games via NBA League Pass to highlights, fantasy basketball, original programming and more via Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Fantasy and across Verizon’s

to deliver premium NBA content and unique fan experiences. Verizon also has rights to deliver leading soccer games, including La Liga and Liga MX, to its customers.

We have also entered into content partnerships to realize synergies available within the marketplace. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement with Samsung in which our
Gemini advertising platform became the exclusive provider of native digital advertising on Samsung mobile products on the Verizon network. In May 2018, Verizon selected
Amazon Web Services, Inc. as its preferred public cloud provider. Also, in January 2019, Verizon Media entered into a multi-year global native advertising deal with Microsoft
to provide marketers access to 20 percent more native advertising inventory through our Ad Platforms; and an exclusive search advertising partnership in which all search
advertising across Verizon Media properties will be served by Microsoft Bing.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue
the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad.
We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable
them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage
of the results of Verizon’s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such
consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.

We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We
also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us
directly  or  against  third-party  suppliers  of  products  or  services  that  we,  in  turn,  sell  to  our  customers,  if  successful,  could  require  us  to  pay  damages  or  royalties,  or  cease
offering the relevant products or services.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2018 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the heading "Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures" and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and
subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

Regulatory and Competitive Trends

Regulatory and Competitive Landscape

Verizon  operates  in  a  regulated  and  highly  competitive  market.  Current  and  potential  competitors  include  other  voice  and  data  service  providers  such  as  other  wireless
companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of
these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our
future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary
regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act
or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.

The  FCC  regulates  several  aspects  of  our  wireless  operations.  Generally,  the  FCC  has  jurisdiction  over  the  construction,  operation,  acquisition  and  transfer  of  wireless
communications  systems.  All  wireless  services  require  use  of  radio  frequency  spectrum,  the  assignment  and  distribution  of  which  is  subject  to  FCC  oversight.  Verizon
anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others,
or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.

Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC
spectrum  licenses  typically  have  a  term  of  10  years,  at  which  time  they  are  subject  to  renewal.  While  the  FCC  has  routinely  renewed  all  of  Verizon’s  wireless  licenses,
challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that
license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers
to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including
construction  and  geographic  coverage  requirements,  technical  operating  standards,  provision  of  enhanced  911  services,  roaming  obligations  and  requirements  for  wireless
tower and antenna facilities.

Broadband

Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized broadband Internet access services as "information services" subject to a "light touch"
regulatory  approach  rather  than  to  the  traditional,  utilities-style  regulations.  In  2015,  the  FCC  declared  that  broadband  Internet  access  services  are  "telecommunications
services" subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to
return  to  "light  touch"  regulation  of  broadband  Internet  access  services.  This  order  is  currently  being  challenged  in  the  courts.  Regardless  of  regulation,  Verizon  remains
committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want,
and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment.

Wireline Voice

Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes,
legacy telephone services are generally considered to be "common carrier" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to
rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply
with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.

Video

Verizon  offers  a  multichannel  video  service  that  is  regulated  like  traditional  cable  service.  The  FCC  has  a  body  of  rules  that  apply  to  cable  operators,  and  these  rules  also
generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local
authorities.

Privacy and Data Security

We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless,
broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC's privacy
requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security, which had shifted from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC following the FCC's
adoption of its 2015 Title II Order, returned to the FTC as a result of the FCC's repeal of the 2015 Title II Order. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements
is  increasing  at  both  the  state  and  federal  level,  and  several  privacy-related  bills  have  been  introduced  or  are  under  considerations  at  each  level.  In  addition,  a  new  data
protection  regulation  went  into  effect  in  Europe  in  May  2018  that  includes  significant  penalties  for  non-compliance,  and  a  new  privacy  law  is  scheduled  to  take  effect  in
California in 2020. These laws could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses.

Public Safety and Cybersecurity

The  FCC  has  played  a  role  in  addressing  public  safety  concerns  by  regulating  emergency  communications  services  and  mandating  widespread  availability  of  both  media
(broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators
may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers.

Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access

The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other
aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline "business data services" and other
services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. In April 2017, the FCC issued an
order, which is currently under appeal, that revised the regulatory structure for business data services, eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets
the FCC determined to be competitive. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for
business data services may be appropriate.

State Regulation and Local Regulation

Wireless Services

The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating
the other "terms and conditions" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several
states  also  have  laws  or  regulations  that  address  safety  issues  (e.g.,  use  of  wireless  handsets  while  driving)  and  taxation  matters.  In  addition,  wireless  tower  and  antenna
facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.

Wireline Services

State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an "incumbent local
exchange  carrier"  in  nine  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  These  incumbent  operations  are  subject  to  various  levels  of  pricing  flexibility  and  other  state  oversight  and
requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to
obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result.

Environmental Matters

Reserves  have  been  established  to  cover  environmental  matters  relating  to  discontinued  businesses  and  past  telecommunications  activities. These  reserves  include  funds  to
address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination  at  the  site.  An  adjustment  to  the  reserves  may  be  made  after  a  cost  allocation  is  conducted  with  respect  to  the  past  and  future  expenses  of  all  of  the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following discussion of "Risk Factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance.
This information should be read in conjunction with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations" and the consolidated financial
statements  and  related  notes.  The  following  discussion  of  risks  is  not  all-inclusive  but  is  designed  to  highlight  what  we  believe  are  important  factors  to  consider  when
evaluating  our  business  and  expectations.  These  factors  could  cause  our  future  results  to  differ  materially  from  our  historical  results  and  from  expectations  reflected  in
forward-looking statements.

Operational Risks

Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.

Cyber  attacks,  including  through  the  use  of  malware,  computer  viruses,  dedicated  denial  of  services  attacks,  credential  harvesting,  social  engineering  and  other  means  for
obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse
effect  on  our  business.  Cyber  attacks  may  cause  equipment  failures,  loss  of  information,  including  sensitive  personal  information  of  customers  or  employees  or  valuable
technical  and  marketing  information,  as  well  as  disruptions  to  our  or  our  customers’  operations.  Cyber  attacks  against  companies,  including  Verizon,  have  increased  in
frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed
by  company  employees  or  external  actors  operating  in  any  geography,  including  jurisdictions  where  law  enforcement  measures  to  address  such  attacks  are  unavailable  or
ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. Cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of
service  is  an  objective  of  the  attacker.  While,  to  date,  we  have  not  been  subject  to  cyber  attacks  which,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  been  material  to  Verizon's
operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be
insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future.

The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of
time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon
could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of
alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. The potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain.
Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our
ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Moreover, our increasing presence in the IoT industry with offerings of
telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber
attacks  impacting  these  products  or  services.  In  addition,  a  compromise  of  security  or  a  theft  or  other  compromise  of  valuable  information,  such  as  financial  data  and
sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation,
adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s results of operation or financial condition.

Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.

Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could
cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain
insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy
may  be  ineffective  or  inadequate,  and  our  disaster  recovery  planning  may  not  be  sufficient  for  all  eventualities.  These  events  could  also  damage  the  infrastructure  of  the
suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing
significant  physical  damage  could  cause  us  to  experience  substantial  losses  resulting  in  significant  recovery  time  and  expenditures  to  resume  operations.  In  addition,  these
occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.

We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.

We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment,
smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device
suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide
equipment  or  service  on  a  timely  basis  or  fail  to  meet  our  performance  expectations,  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  products  and  services  as  and  when  requested  by  our
customers.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  continue  to  maintain  or  upgrade  our  networks.  Because  of  the  cost  and  time  lag  that  can  be  associated  with  transitioning  from  one
supplier  to  another,  our  business  could  be  substantially  disrupted  if  we  were  required  to,  or  chose  to,  replace  the  products  or  services  of  one  or  more  major  suppliers  with
products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating
efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent
infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our

17

Table of Contents

business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.

A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the
renegotiation of our labor contracts.

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent
negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while less than 1% of the
workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this
workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations.

Economic and Strategic Risks

We face significant competition that may reduce our profits.

We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among
wireless, cable, Internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies,
wireless  service  providers,  satellite  providers,  application  and  device  providers  and  providers  of  VoIP  services.  While  these  changes  have  enabled  us  to  offer  new  types  of
products  and  services,  they  have  also  allowed  other  providers  to  broaden  the  scope  of  their  own  competitive  offerings.  If  we  are  unable  to  compete  effectively,  we  could
experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its
fair value and cause us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax)
goodwill impairment charge on our Media reporting unit. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with
their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting
Verizon Wireless customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and
services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our
capital  resources.  It  will  also  depend  on  how  successfully  we  anticipate  and  respond  to  various  factors  affecting  our  industries,  including  new  technologies  and  business
models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these
competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.

If we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the
demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.

Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the
markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings
to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose
customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. In addition, there could be legal or
regulatory  restraints  on  our  introduction  of  new  services.  If  our  services  fail  to  gain  acceptance  in  the  marketplace,  or  if  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  and
introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected.

In addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to
do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.

Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.

Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our
products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer
higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business
customers  that  we  serve  may  delay  purchasing  decisions,  delay  full  implementation  of  service  offerings  or  reduce  their  use  of  services.  In  addition,  adverse  economic
conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.

Our  domestic  operations  are  subject  to  regulation  by  the  FCC  and  other  federal,  state  and  local  agencies,  and  our  international  operations  are  regulated  by  various  foreign
governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified
products  or  services.  We  are  frequently  required  to  maintain  licenses  for  our  operations  and  conduct  our  operations  in  accordance  with  prescribed  standards.  We  are  often
involved  in  regulatory  and  other  governmental  proceedings  or  inquiries  related  to  the  application  of  these  requirements.  It  is  impossible  to  predict  with  any  certainty  the
outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing
laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10
years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below, could restrict the
ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media and Telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and
potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers.

•

•

•

Privacy and data protection - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. A new data protection regulation, which
went into effect in Europe in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. A new privacy law scheduled to take effect in California in 2020, also
could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses.

Regulation  of  broadband  Internet  access  services  -  In  its  2015  Title  II  Order,  the  FCC  nullified  its  longstanding  "light  touch"  approach  to  regulating  broadband
Internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the
2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been appealed to the D.C. Circuit;
the outcome and timing of this appeal or any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders
that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’s 2015 rules). The enforceability and effect of
these state rules is uncertain.

"Open Access"  -  we  hold  certain  wireless  licenses  that  require  us  to  comply  with  so-called  "open  access"  FCC  regulations,  which  generally  require  licensees  of
particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the
FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.

The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return
we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.

We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.

We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and
hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also
faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in
defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

Financial Risks

Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.

As  of  December  31,  2018,  Verizon  had  approximately  $103.0 billion  of  outstanding  unsecured  indebtedness,  as  well  as  approximately  $9.4  billion  of  unused  borrowing
capacity under its existing credit facility. Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce
the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;

making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt
refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;

reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions;

making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and

19

Table of Contents

•

exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.

Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.

We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets.
Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our
operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,
which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing
and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do
business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.

Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

With approximately 144,500 employees and approximately 195,000 retirees as of December 31, 2018 eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension
benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for
these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality
assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce
our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

In  October  2013,  the  California  Attorney  General’s  Office  notified  certain  Verizon  companies  of  potential  violations  of  California  state  hazardous  waste  statutes  primarily
arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review
our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties
ultimately incurred will be material.

Item 5.    Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market for trading in the common stock of Verizon is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VZ". As of December 31, 2018, there were 630,756
shareholders of record.

Stock Repurchases

In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or  at  the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2020,  whichever  is  sooner. Under the program,
shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The
timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company’s capital allocation priorities.

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At
December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is
required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established
in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018.

Table of Contents

In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended
to ensure an effective internal control environment. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we implemented certain internal controls in connection with the new lease accounting
standard, which we adopted effective January 1, 2019. Other than the above-noted change, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the fourth quarter of 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Verizon’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in the 2018
Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders and are incorporated herein by reference.

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT

EXHIBIT 10c(ix)

AGREEMENT between Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.

1. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.

2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 Verizon Communications Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and sufficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon Communication’s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised
in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.

3. Contingency. The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on February 12, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“Vesting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such
time as he or she returns to active employment with Verizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established
by the Company.

4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’s account under the Special Performance RSU grant, administered by
Fidelity Investments or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of Verizon’s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to
the closing price of Verizon’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be
added to each RSU each time that a dividend is paid on Verizon’s common stock. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of
Verizon’s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the closing price of Verizon’s common stock traded on the NYSE on the
dividend payment date of each declared dividend on Verizon’s common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’s RSU balance. To the
extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error, including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number or value of the RSUs granted to the
Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’s account or the amount of the final award payment, the Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the
right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by the Company or Fidelity.

5. Vesting.

(a) Time-Based Vesting. The Participant shall vest in one hundred percent (100%) of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant, including DEUs credited with
respect to such RSUs pursuant to the terms hereof (the “Target Number of RSUs”), on December 31, 2020. The Participant must be continuously employed by the
Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through December 31, 2020 as a condition to vesting of any RSUs
hereunder, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.

(b) Additional Performance-Based Vesting.

(1) General. If both (x) the Target Number of RSUs vest pursuant to paragraph 5(a) or Section 7(c)(1) and (y) Verizon’s Wireless Service Revenue (as defined below)
during the three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2020 meets or exceeds xxx Dollars ($xxx), then an
additional number of RSUs shall vest as of December 31, 2020 equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Target Number of RSUs.

(2) Definition of Wireless Service Revenue. As used in this Agreement, the term “Wireless Service Revenue” means revenue generated from access to and usage of
the wireless network, as such terms are used in Verizon’s consolidated financial statements. The Committee will (to the extent necessary and without duplication)
adjust such revenue to eliminate the financial impact of (i) acquisitions, divestitures or changes in business structure; (ii) changes in legal, tax, accounting or
regulatory policy; and (iii) other

1

items that are extraordinary in nature or not deemed to be in the ordinary course of business. The Committee’s determination of whether, and the extent to which, any
such adjustment is necessary shall be final and binding.

(c) Transfer. Transfer of employment from Verizon to a Related Company, from a Related Company to Verizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder, and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a).

6. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in shares of Verizon common stock. Subject to paragraph 7(a), as soon as practicable after December 31, 2020
(but in no event later than March 15, 2021), the number of shares that vested (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the Participant. The number of shares that shall
be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested pursuant to the terms hereof. If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made,
such payment shall be made to the Participant’s beneficiary, as designated under paragraph 11. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the RSU shall be
canceled; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement,
shall remain in effect.

7. Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, RSUs may vest or be forfeited before the vesting and payment dates set
forth above as follows:

(a) Termination for Cause. If the Participant’s employment by the Company or a Related Company is terminated by the Company or a Related Company for Cause (as
defined below) at any time prior to the date that the RSUs are paid pursuant to paragraph 6, the RSUs (whether vested or not) shall automatically terminate and be
cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(b) Voluntary Separation On or Before December 31, 2020, or Other Separation Not Described in Paragraph 7(c). If the Participant (i) voluntarily separates from
employment on or before December 31, 2020 for any reason, or (ii) otherwise separates from employment on or before December 31, 2020 under circumstances not
described in paragraph 7(c), all then-unvested RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any
consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(c) Involuntary Termination Without Cause On or Before December 31, 2020, Termination Due to Death or Disability On or Before December 31, 2020.

(1) This paragraph 7(c) shall apply if the Participant separates from employment by reason of an involuntary termination without Cause (as determined by the
Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee)), death, or Disability (as defined below) on or before December 31,
2020.

(2) If the Participant separates from employment on or before December 31, 2020 under circumstances described in paragraph 7(c)(1), (x) the Participant’s Target
Number of RSUs shall vest (without prorating the award), and (y) the Participant shall remain eligible to vest in additional RSUs in accordance with paragraph 5(b)
(subject to the performance requirement set forth therein being met), provided in each case that the Participant has not and does not commit a breach of any of the
Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement and provided that the Participant executes, within the time prescribed by
Verizon, a release satisfactory to Verizon waiving any claims he or she may have against Verizon and any Related Company (otherwise, paragraph 7(b) shall apply).

(3) Any RSUs that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(c)(2) shall be payable as provided in paragraph 6.

(4) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) “Cause” means (i) incompetence or negligence in the discharge of, or inattention to or neglect of or failure to perform, the duties and responsibilities
assigned to the Participant; fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; or a material breach of the Verizon Code of Conduct (as in effect at the relevant time)
or any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, all as determined by the Executive Vice President
and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) in his or her discretion, or (ii) commission of any felony of which the Participant is
finally adjudged guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii) “Disability” shall mean the total and permanent disability of the Participant as defined by, or determined under, the Company’s long-term disability
benefit plan.

(d) Change in Control. If a Participant is involuntarily terminated without Cause within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Verizon
(as defined in the Plan) and before December 31, 2020, the RSUs shall vest (without prorating the award) by deeming the performance goal in paragraph 5(b) and the
continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a) to be satisfied in full; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, shall remain in effect. A Change in Control or an involuntary termination without Cause that
occurs

2

after December 31, 2020 shall have no effect on whether any RSUs vest or become payable under this paragraph 7(d). If both paragraph 7(c) and this paragraph 7(d)
would otherwise apply in the circumstances, this paragraph 7(d) shall control. All payments provided in this paragraph 7(d) shall be made at their regularly scheduled time
as specified in paragraph 6.

(e) Vesting Schedule. Except and to the extent provided in paragraphs 7(c) and (d), nothing in this paragraph 7 shall alter the vesting schedule prescribed by paragraph 5.

8. Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the RSUs until the date on which the Participant becomes the holder of record with
respect to any shares of Verizon common stock to which this grant relates. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or
other rights for which the record date occurs while the RSUs are outstanding.

9. Amendment of Agreement. Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Committee nor the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) may, without the written consent of the Participant, change any term, condition or provision
affecting the RSUs if the change would have a material adverse effect upon the RSUs or the Participant’s rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the
Committee or the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) from exercising administrative discretion with respect to the
Plan or this Agreement, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. This discretion includes, but is not limited to, corrections of any errors,
including but not limited to any administrative errors, determining the total percentage of RSUs that become payable, and determining whether the Participant has been
discharged for Cause, has a Disability, has breached any of the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or has satisfied the
requirements for vesting and payment under paragraphs 5 and 7 of this Agreement.

10. Assignment. The RSUs shall not be assigned, pledged or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

11. Beneficiary. The Participant shall designate a beneficiary in writing and in such manner as is acceptable to the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer
of Verizon (or his or her designee). Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant with respect to the Participant’s benefits under the Plan and shall
be effective only when filed by the Participant with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If the Participant fails to so designate a beneficiary, or if no such designated
beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary shall be the Participant’s estate.

12. Other Plans and Agreements. Any payment received by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination
of the Participant’s benefits under any pension, savings, life insurance, severance or other benefit plan maintained by Verizon or a Related Company. The Participant
acknowledges that this Agreement or any prior RSU agreement shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any other plans maintained by the
Company or a Related Company.

13. Company and Related Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Company” means Verizon Communications Inc. “Related Company” means (a) any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership or proprietary interest of 50 percent or more at any time
during the term of this Agreement, or (b) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership
or other proprietary interest of less than 50 percent at any time during the term of this Agreement but which, in the discretion of the Committee, is treated as a Related
Company for purposes of this Agreement.

14. Employment Status. The grant of the RSUs shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company
and the Participant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ of any such Company or Related Company.

15. Withholding. The Participant acknowledges that he or she shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of RSUs, and the Company shall make
such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

16. Securities Laws. The Company shall not be required to make payment with respect to any shares of common stock prior to the admission of such shares to listing on any
stock exchange on which the stock may then be listed and the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law or rulings or
regulations of any government body that the Company, in its discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable.

17. Committee Authority. The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or
construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Committee in its discretion, as described in
paragraph 9. The Committee and the Audit Committee may designate any individual or individuals to perform any of its functions hereunder and utilize experts to assist in
carrying out their duties hereunder.

18. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the RSUs
may have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All

3

terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’s death, to
refer to and be binding upon the Participant’s heirs and beneficiaries.

19. Construction. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits
A and B to this Agreement, is held to be unenforceable for being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent
necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The RSUs are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

20. Defined Terms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the
terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate.

21. Execution of Agreement. The Participant shall indicate his or her consent and acknowledgment to the terms of this Agreement (including the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) and the Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise shall comply with
the requirements of paragraph 3. In addition, by consenting to the terms of this Agreement and the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this
Agreement, the Participant expressly agrees and acknowledges that Fidelity may deliver all documents, statements and notices associated with the Plan and this Agreement to
the Participant in electronic form. The Participant and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance,
agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if the Participant and Verizon executed this Agreement (including the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) in paper form.

22. Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the Participant shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any of the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph
22 does not prevent the Participant from disclosing the terms of this Agreement to the Participant’s spouse or beneficiary or to the Participant’s legal, tax, or financial adviser,
provided that the Participant take all reasonable measures to assure that the individual to whom disclosure is made does not disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party
except as otherwise required by law.

23. Applicable Law. Except as expressly provided in Exhibit B, the validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

24. Notice. Any notice to the Company provided for in this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative
Officer of Verizon at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 and any notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the current address
shown on the payroll of the Company, or to such other address as the Participant may designate to the Company in writing. Any notice shall be delivered by hand, sent by
telecopy, sent by overnight carrier, or enclosed in a properly sealed envelope as stated above, registered and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post office regularly maintained by
the United States Postal Service.

25. Dispute Resolution.

(a)    General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 26 below, all disputes arising under or related to the Plan or this Agreement and all claims in which a
Participant seeks damages or other relief that relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan are subject to the dispute resolution procedure described below in this
paragraph 25.

(i)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Award Dispute” shall mean any claim against the Company or a Related Company, other than Units
Damages Disputes described in paragraph (a)(ii) below, regarding (A) the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, (B) any of the terms or conditions of
the RSUs issued under this Agreement, or (C) allegations of entitlement to RSUs or additional RSUs, or any other benefits, under the Plan or this
Agreement; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or
to the forfeiture of an award as a result of a breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement
shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures provided for in this paragraph 25.

(ii)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Damages Dispute” shall mean any claims between the Participant and the Company or a Related
Company (or against the past or present directors, officers, employees, representatives, or agents of the Company or a Related Company, whether acting in
their capacity as such or otherwise), that are related in any way to the Participant’s employment or former employment, including claims of alleged
employment discrimination, wrongful termination, or violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other
U.S. federal, state or local law, statute, regulation, or ordinance relating to employment or any common law theories of recovery relating to employment,
such as breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims, in which the damages or other relief sought relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan
or this Agreement.

4

(b)    Internal Dispute Resolution Procedure. All Units Award Disputes, and all Units Damages Dispute alleging breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims with
respect to the Plan or this Agreement (collectively, “Plan Disputes”), shall be referred in the first instance to the Verizon Employee Benefits Committee (“EB Committee”)
for resolution internally within Verizon. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, all Plan Disputes must be filed in writing with the EB Committee no later than one
year from the date that the dispute accrues. Consistent with paragraph 25(c)(i) of this Agreement, all decisions relating to the enforceability of the limitations period
contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the EB Committee shall have full power, discretion, and authority to interpret the
Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Plan Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement. Determinations made by the EB Committee shall be final, conclusive and
binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to paragraph (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. A Participant’s failure to refer a Plan
Dispute to the EB Committee for resolution will in no way impair the Company’s right to compel arbitration or the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii).

(c)    Arbitration. All appeals from determinations by the EB Committee as described in paragraph (b) above, and any Units Damages Dispute, shall be fully and finally
settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on an individual basis (and not on a collective or class action basis) before a single
arbitrator pursuant to the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time any such arbitration is initiated. Any such arbitration must be initiated in writing
pursuant to the aforesaid rules of the AAA no later than one year from the date that the claim accrues, except where a longer limitations period is required by applicable
law. However, a Participant’s failure to initiate arbitration within one year will in no way impair the Company’s right, exercised at its discretion, to compel arbitration or
the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii). Decisions about the applicability of the limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. A copy
of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The Participant agrees that the arbitration shall be held at the office of the AAA
nearest the place of the Participant’s most recent employment by the Company or a Related Company, unless the parties agree in writing to a different location. All claims
by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.

(i) The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all
issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy, and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and
shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall
be upheld unless such decision was arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and
enforceable in any applicable court.

(ii) The Participant understands and agrees that, pursuant to this Agreement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive
any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity, to have a trial by jury, or to resolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for
breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), and that the sole forum available
for the resolution of Units Award Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as provided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court
finds that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are not enforceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand
and agree to waive their right to trial by jury of any Units Award Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute resolution procedure shall not
prevent either the Participant or the Company or a Related Company from commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of obtaining injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm pending and in aid of arbitration hereunder; in such event, both the Participant
and the Company or a Related Company agree that the party who commences the action may proceed without necessity of posting a bond.

(iii) In consideration of the Participant’s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and
arbitrator’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a
Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not
limited to each party’s attorney’s fees, will be the responsibility of such party.

(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units Award Disputes and
Units Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall
be interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.

(v) The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the FAA is held not to apply, or if
application of the FAA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the
laws of the State of Delaware shall apply without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

(vi) To the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan
pursuant to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the

5

Participant’s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to Verizon as provided under paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the
benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.

26. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or
remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause
or to involuntarily terminate the Participant without Cause), the Participant acknowledges that—

(a) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement are essential to the continued goodwill and profitability of the Company
and any Related Company;

(b) The Participant has broad-based skills that will serve as the basis for other employment opportunities that are not prohibited by the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(c) When the Participant’s employment with the Company or any Related Company terminates, the Participant shall be able to earn a livelihood without violating any of
the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(d) Irreparable damage to the Company or any Related Company shall result in the event that the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions;

(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy, and no bond or other security
shall be required in connection therewith;

(f) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation of
this Agreement;

(g) The Participant’s breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including, for example, any breach of
the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and

(h) All disputes relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including their interpretation and enforceability
and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead
be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Exhibit A - Participant’s Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, you, the Participant, agree to the following obligations:

1. Effect of a Material Restatement of Financial Results; Recoupment; Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions.

(a) General. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that, with respect to all RSUs granted to you on or after January 1, 2007 and all short-
term incentive awards made to you on or after January 1, 2007, to the extent the Company or any Related Company is required to materially restate any financial results
based upon your willful misconduct or gross negligence while employed by the Company or any Related Company (and where such restatement would have resulted in a
lower payment being made to you), you will be required to repay all previously paid or deferred (i) RSUs and (ii) short-term incentive awards that were provided to you
during the performance periods that are the subject of the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. For purposes of this paragraph, “willful misconduct”
and “gross negligence” shall be as determined by the Committee. The Audit Committee of the Verizon Board of Directors shall determine whether a material restatement
of financial results has occurred. If you do not repay the entire amount required under this paragraph, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset
your obligation to repay against any source of income available to it, including but not limited to any money you may have in your nonqualified deferral accounts.

(b) Requirements of Recoupment Policy or Applicable Law. The repayment rights contained in paragraph 1(a) of Exhibit A shall be in addition to, and shall not limit,
any other rights or remedies that the Company may have under law or in equity, including, without limitation, (i) any right that the Company may have under any
Company recoupment policy that may apply to you, or (ii) any right or obligation that the Company may have regarding the clawback of “incentive-based compensation”
under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as determined by the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) or under any other applicable law. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree and consent to the Company’s
application, implementation and enforcement of any such Company recoupment policy (as it may be in effect from time to time) that may apply to you and any provision
of applicable law relating to cancellation, rescission, payback or recoupment of compensation and expressly agree that the Company may take such actions as are
permitted under any such policy (as applicable to you) or applicable law, such as the cancellation of RSUs and repayment of amounts previously paid or deferred with
respect to any previously granted RSUs or short-term incentive awards, without further consent or action being required by you.

(c) Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree to comply with all Company policies regarding trading in
securities or derivative securities (including, without limitation, the Company’s policies prohibiting trading on material inside information regarding the Company or any
business with which the Company does business, the Company’s policies prohibiting engaging in financial transactions that would allow you to benefit from a devaluation
of the Company’s securities, and any additional policy that the Company may adopt prohibiting you from hedging your economic exposure to the Company’s securities),
as such policies are in effect from time to time and for as long as such policies are applicable to you.

2. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit A, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached.

3. Agreement to Participant’s Obligations. You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit A in accordance with the instructions
provided in the Agreement, and your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of such obligations and restrictions. As stated in paragraph 21 of the
Agreement, you and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be
legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit A in paper form.

Exhibit B – Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached, you, the Participant, and the Company or any Related Company which employs or employed you, agree to the
following obligations:

1. Non-competition.

(a) Prohibited Conduct. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months following a
termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(1) personally engage in Competitive Activities (as defined below); or

(2) work for, own, manage, operate, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or provide consulting or advisory services to, any
person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or any company or person affiliated with such person,
partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities; provided that your purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of
securities of a publicly traded company shall not constitute “ownership” or “participation in the ownership” for purposes of this paragraph so long as your equity
interest in any such company is less than a controlling interest;

provided that this paragraph (a) shall not prohibit you from (i) being employed by, or providing services to, a consulting firm, provided that you do not personally engage
in Competitive Activities or provide consulting or advisory services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive
Activities, or any person or entity affiliated with such person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or (ii) engaging
in the practice of law as an in-house counsel, sole practitioner or as a partner in (or as an employee of or counsel to) a corporation or law firm in accordance with
applicable legal and professional standards. Exception (ii), however, does not apply to any Participant that may be engaging in Competitive Activities or providing
services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, wherein such engagement or services being provided
are not primarily the practice of law.

(b) Competitive Activities. For purposes of the Agreement, to which this Exhibit B is attached, “Competitive Activities” means any activities relating to products or
services of the same or similar type as the products or services (1) which were or are sold (or, pursuant to an existing business plan, will be sold) to paying customers of
the Company or any Related Company, and (2) for which you have any direct or indirect responsibility or any involvement to plan, develop, manage, market, sell,
oversee, support, implement or perform, or had any such responsibility or involvement within your most recent 24 months of employment with the Company or any
Related Company. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an activity shall not be treated as a Competitive Activity if the geographic marketing area of such same or
similar products or services does not overlap with the geographic marketing area for the applicable products and services of the Company or any Related Company.

2. Interference With Business Relations. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months
following a termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(a) recruit, induce or solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company or Related Company who was employed by the Company or any Related Company prior
to or as of your termination date and whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while employed by the Company or any Related
Company for employment or for retention as a consultant or service provider to any person or entity;

(b) hire or participate (with another person or entity) in the process of recruiting, soliciting or hiring, directly or indirectly, (other than for the Company or any Related
Company) any person who is then an employee of the Company or any Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information
about, while employed by the Company or any Related Company, or provide, directly or indirectly, names or other information about any employees of the Company or
Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while employed by the Company or any Related Company to any
person or entity (other than to the Company or any Related Company) under circumstances that could lead to the use of any such information for purposes of recruiting,
soliciting or hiring any such employee for any person or entity;

(c) interfere, or attempt to interfere, directly or indirectly, with any relationship of the Company or any Related Company with any of its employees, agents, or
representatives;

(d) solicit or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, directly or indirectly, any client, customer, or Prospect (defined below) of the Company or any Related
Company (1) to cease being, or not to become, a customer of the Company or any Related Company, or (2) to divert any business of such customer or Prospect from the
Company or any Related Company; or

8

(e) otherwise interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to interfere with or disrupt, directly or indirectly, the relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any
Related Company and any of its customers, clients, Prospects, suppliers, vendors, service providers, developers, joint ventures, equity investments or partners, inventors,
consultants, employees, agents, or representatives.

For purposes of this paragraph 2, “Prospect” shall mean any person or entity from whom or which any business was being solicited by Verizon or any Related Company within
the most recent 12 month period of your employment.

3. Proprietary and Confidential Information. You shall at all times, including after any termination of your employment with the Company or any Related Company,
preserve the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information (defined below) and trade secrets of the Company or any Related Company, and you shall not use for the benefit of
yourself or any person, other than the Company or a Related Company, or disclose to any person, except and to the extent that disclosure of such information is authorized
under applicable laws or regulations (e.g., “whistleblower” laws such as 18 USC 1833(b) described below), any Proprietary Information or trade secrets of the Company or any
Related Company. “Proprietary Information” means any information or data related to the Company or any Related Company, including information entrusted to the Company
or a Related Company by others, which has not been fully disclosed to the public by the Company or a Related Company, which is treated as confidential or otherwise
protected within the Company or any Related Company or is of value to competitors, such as strategic or tactical business plans; undisclosed business, operational or financial
data; ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, models, devices, programs, computer software, or related information; documents relating to regulatory matters or
correspondence with governmental entities; information concerning any past, pending, or threatened legal dispute; pricing or cost data; the identity, reports or analyses of
business prospects; business transactions (including those that are contemplated or planned); research data; personnel information or data; identities of suppliers to the
Company or any Related Company or users or purchasers of the Company’s or Related Company’s products or services; the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached; and
any other non-public information pertaining to or known by the Company or a Related Company, including confidential or non-public information of a third party that you
know or should know the Company or a Related Company is obligated to protect. Section 18 USC 1833(b) provides that “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly
liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that—(A) is made—(i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either
directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document
filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.” Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for
disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b).

4. Return of Company Property; Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that on or before termination of your employment for any reason with the
Company or any Related Company, you shall return to the Company all property owned by the Company or any Related Company or in which the Company or any Related
Company has an interest or to which the Company or any Related Company has any obligation, including any and all files, documents, data, records and any other non-public
information (whether on paper or in tapes, disks, memory devices, or other machine-readable form), office equipment, credit cards, and employee identification cards. You
acknowledge that the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company) is the rightful owner of, and you hereby do grant and assign, all right, title and interest in and to any
programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material; and trademarks that you
may have originated, created or developed, or assisted or participated in originating, creating or developing, during your period of employment with the Company or a Related
Company, including all intellectual property rights in or based on the foregoing, where any such origination, creation or development (a) involved any use of Company or
Related Company time, information or resources, (b) was made in the exercise of any of your duties or responsibilities for or on behalf of the Company or a Related Company,
or (c) was related to (i) the Company’s or a Related Company’s past, present or future business, or (ii) the Company’s or a Related Company’s actual or demonstrably
anticipated research, development or procurement activities. You shall at all times, both before and after termination of your employment, cooperate with the Company (or, as
applicable, any Related Company) and its representatives in executing and delivering documents requested by the Company or a Related Company, and taking any other
actions, that are necessary or requested by the Company or a Related Company to assist the Company or any Related Company in patenting, copyrighting, protecting,
registering, or enforcing any programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material;
trademarks; or other intellectual property rights, and to vest title thereto solely in the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company).

5. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit B, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit B shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached.

6. Agreement to Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations.

(a) You acknowledge that the geographic boundaries, scope of prohibited activities, and time duration of the restrictions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above are

reasonable in nature and are no broader than are necessary to maintain the confidential information, trade secrets and the goodwill of the Company and its Related
Companies and to protect the other legitimate business interests of the Company and its Related Companies and are not unduly restrictive on you. In addition, you
and the Company agree and intend that the covenants contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants and agreements, one for
each and every county or political subdivision of each applicable state of the United States and each country of the world. It is the desire and intent of the parties
hereto that the provisions of this Exhibit B be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the governing laws and public policies of the State of New Jersey, and
to the extent applicable, each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any provision in this Exhibit A or deemed to be included in this Exhibit A
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of the parties hereto, shall be deemed amended to delete or

9

to modify (including, without limitation, a reduction in duration, geographical area or prohibited business activities) the portion adjudicated to be invalid or

unenforceable, such deletion or modification to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is

made, and such deletion or modification to be made only to the extent necessary to cause the provision as amended to be valid and enforceable.

(b) You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit B in accordance with the instructions provided in the Agreement, and
your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of such obligations and restrictions. As stated in paragraph 21 of the Agreement, you and Verizon
hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and
have the same legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit B in paper form.

7. Governing Law and Non-exclusive Forum. The parties expressly agree: (a) that, because the Plan is centrally administered in the State of New Jersey by employees of a
Verizon Communications Inc. affiliate, the subject matter of this Exhibit B bears a reasonable relationship to the State of New Jersey; (b) that this Exhibit B is made under,
shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to that jurisdiction’s choice of law rules; and (c)
the parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of New Jersey, and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of New Jersey, over any action, claim, controversy or proceeding arising under this Exhibit B, and irrevocably waive any objection they may now or hereafter have to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

EXHIBIT 10c(viii)

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
2018 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT

AGREEMENT between Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.

1. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.

2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 Verizon Communications Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and sufficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon’s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

3. Contingency. The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on June 29, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“Vesting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such
time as he or she returns to work with Verizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established by the
Company.

4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’s account under the 2018 RSU grant, administered by Fidelity Investments
or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of Verizon’s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to the closing price of
Verizon’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be added to each RSU
each time that a dividend is paid on Verizon’s common stock with respect to each dividend record date that occurs after the date of grant and prior to the payment of an RSU.
The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of Verizon’s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into RSUs or fractions thereof
based upon the closing price of Verizon’s common stock traded on the NYSE on the dividend payment date of each declared dividend on Verizon’s common stock, and such
RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’s RSU balance. DEUs that are credited will be subject to the same vesting, termination and other terms as the RSUs
to which they relate. To the extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error, including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number or value of the
RSUs granted to the Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’s account or the amount of the final award payment, the Company or Fidelity
specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by the Company or
Fidelity.

5. Vesting.

(a) General. The Participant shall vest in the RSUs as follows: one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such
RSUs) shall vest on April 9, 2019, one-third of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on April 9,
2020, and the remaining number of RSUs subject to this grant (including DEUs credited with respect to such RSUs) shall vest on April 9, 2021. The Participant must be
continuously employed by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through each of the applicable vesting
dates specified in this paragraph 5(a) as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the RSUs, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early
Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.

(b) Transfer. Transfer of employment from Verizon to a Related Company, from a Related Company to Verizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder, and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). If the Participant transfers employment pursuant to this paragraph 5(b), the Participant will still be required to
satisfy the definition of “Retire” under paragraph 7 of this Agreement in order to be eligible for the accelerated vesting provisions in connection with a retirement.

6. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in cash. Subject to paragraph 7(a), as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the applicable installment of
the RSUs specified in Section 5(a) (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the applicable vesting date), the value of shares that vested on the applicable
vesting date (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the

1

Participant. The amount of cash that shall be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested on the applicable vesting date times the closing price
of Verizon’s common stock on the NYSE as of the applicable vesting date (or if the common stock is not traded on such vesting date, last trading date that immediately
precedes the applicable vesting date). If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’s beneficiary, as
designated under paragraph 11. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the RSU shall be cancelled; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but
not limited to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, shall remain in effect.

7. Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, RSUs may vest or be forfeited before the applicable vesting and payment
dates set forth above as follows:

(a) Termination for Cause. If the Participant’s employment by the Company or a Related Company is terminated by the Company or a Related Company for Cause (as
defined below) at any time prior to the date that the RSUs are paid pursuant to paragraph 6, the RSUs (whether vested or not) shall automatically terminate and be
cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(b) Retirement Before July 1, 2018, Voluntary Separation On or Before April 9, 2021, or Other Separation Not Described in Paragraph 7(c). If the Participant (i)
Retires (as defined below) before July 1, 2018, (ii) voluntarily separates from employment on or before April 9, 2021 for any reason other than Retirement, or (iii)
otherwise separates from employment on or before April 9, 2021 under circumstances not described in paragraph 7(c), all then-unvested RSUs shall automatically
terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(c) Retirement After June 30, 2018, Involuntary Termination Without Cause On or Before April 9, 2021, Termination Due to Death or Disability On or Before
April 9, 2021.

(1) This paragraph 7(c) shall apply if the Participant:

(i) Retires (as defined below) after June 30, 2018, or

(ii) Separates from employment by reason of an involuntary termination without Cause (as determined by the Executive Vice President and Chief
Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee)), death, or Disability (as defined below) on or before April 9, 2021.

(2) If the Participant separates from employment on or before April 9, 2021 under circumstances described in paragraph 7(c)(1), the Participant’s then-unvested
RSUs shall vest (without prorating the award) without regard to the continuous employment requirement set forth in paragraph 5(a), provided that the Participant has
not and does not commit a breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement and provided that the
Participant executes, within the time prescribed by Verizon, a release satisfactory to Verizon waiving any claims he or she may have against Verizon and any Related
Company (otherwise, paragraph 7(b) shall apply).

(3) Any RSUs that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(c)(2) shall be payable as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the applicable installment of the RSUs specified
in Section 5(a) that would have applied had such RSUs not vested earlier under paragraph 7(c)(2) (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the
applicable vesting date).

(4) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) “Cause” means (i) incompetence or negligence in the discharge of, or inattention to or neglect of or failure to perform, the duties and responsibilities
assigned to the Participant; fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; or a material breach of the Verizon Code of Conduct (as in effect at the relevant time)
or any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, all as determined by the Executive Vice President and
Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) in his or her discretion, or (ii) commission of any felony of which the Participant is finally
adjudged guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii) “Disability” shall mean the total and permanent disability of the Participant as defined by, or determined under, the Company’s long-term disability
benefit plan.

(iii) “Retire” and “Retirement” means: (i) to retire after having attained at least 15 years of vesting service (as defined under the applicable Verizon tax-
qualified 401(k) savings plan) and a combination of age and years of vesting service that equals or exceeds 75 points, or (ii) retirement under any other
circumstances determined in writing by the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee), provided that, in
the case of either (i) or (ii) in this paragraph, the retirement was not occasioned by a discharge for Cause. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
Participant is employed in the United Kingdom, “Retire” or “Retirement” shall mean: (A) subject to applicable law, a termination of employment on the
grounds of age, provided that the Participant has attained at least age 65; or (B) retirement under any other circumstances determined in writing by the
Executive Vice President and Chief

2

Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee), provided that, in the case of either (A) or (B) in this paragraph, the retirement was not occasioned
by a discharge for Cause.

(d) Change in Control. If a Participant is involuntarily terminated without Cause within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Verizon
(as defined in the Plan), all then-unvested RSUs shall vest and become payable (without prorating the award) and the continuous employment requirement in paragraph
5(a) shall be deemed satisfied in full as if the Participant’s employment with the Company or a Related Company had continued through the applicable vesting date;
provided, however, that all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this
Agreement, shall remain in effect. A Change in Control or an involuntary termination without Cause that occurs after the applicable vesting date of the RSUs set forth in
paragraph 5(a) shall have no effect on whether any RSUs vest or become payable under this paragraph 7(d). If both paragraph 7(c) and this paragraph 7(d) would
otherwise apply in the circumstances, this paragraph 7(d) shall control. All payments provided in this paragraph 7(d) shall be made at their regularly scheduled time as
specified in paragraph 6.

(e) Vesting Schedule. Except and to the extent provided in paragraphs 7(c) and (d), nothing in this paragraph 7 shall alter the vesting schedule prescribed by paragraph 5.

8. Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the RSUs. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no adjustment shall
be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs while the RSUs are outstanding.

9. Amendment of Agreement. Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Committee nor the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) may, without the written consent of the Participant, change any term, condition or provision
affecting the RSUs if the change would have a material adverse effect upon the RSUs or the Participant’s rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the
Committee or the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) from exercising administrative discretion with respect to the
Plan or this Agreement, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. This discretion includes, but is not limited to, corrections of any errors,
including but not limited to any administrative errors, and determining whether the Participant has been discharged for Cause, has a Disability, has Retired, has breached any of
the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or has satisfied the requirements for vesting and payment under paragraphs 5 and 7
of this Agreement.

10. Assignment. The RSUs shall not be assigned, pledged or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

11. Beneficiary. The Participant shall designate a beneficiary in writing and in such manner as is acceptable to the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer
of Verizon (or his or her designee). Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant with respect to the Participant’s benefits under the Plan and shall
be effective only when filed by the Participant with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If the Participant fails to so designate a beneficiary, or if no such designated
beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary shall be the Participant’s estate.

12. Other Plans and Agreements. Any payment received by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination
of the Participant’s benefits under any pension, savings, life insurance, severance or other benefit plan maintained by Verizon or a Related Company. The Participant
acknowledges that this Agreement or any prior RSU agreement shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any other plans maintained by the
Company or a Related Company.

13. Company and Related Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Company” means Verizon Communications Inc. “Related Company” means (a) any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership or proprietary interest of 50 percent or more at any time
during the term of this Agreement, or (b) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership
or other proprietary interest of less than 50 percent at any time during the term of this Agreement but which, in the discretion of the Committee, is treated as a Related
Company for purposes of this Agreement.

14. Employment Status. The grant of the RSUs shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company
and the Participant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ of any such Company or Related Company.

15. Withholding. The Participant acknowledges that he or she shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of RSUs, and the Company shall make
such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

16. Securities Laws. The Company shall not be required to make payment with respect to any shares of common stock prior to the admission of such shares to listing on any
stock exchange on which the stock may then be listed and the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law or rulings or
regulations of any government body that the Company, in its discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable.

3

17. Committee Authority. The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or
construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Committee in its discretion, as described in
paragraph 9. The Committee and the Audit Committee may designate any individual or individuals to perform any of its functions hereunder and utilize experts to assist in
carrying out their duties hereunder.

18. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the RSUs
may have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant
shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’s death, to refer to and be binding upon the Participant’s heirs and beneficiaries.

19. Construction. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits
A and B to this Agreement, is held to be unenforceable for being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent
necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The RSUs are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

20. Defined Terms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the
terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate.

21. Execution of Agreement. The Participant shall indicate his or her consent and acknowledgment to the terms of this Agreement (including the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) and the Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise shall comply with
the requirements of paragraph 3. In addition, by consenting to the terms of this Agreement and the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this
Agreement, the Participant expressly agrees and acknowledges that Fidelity may deliver all documents, statements and notices associated with the Plan and this Agreement to
the Participant in electronic form. The Participant and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance,
agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if the Participant and Verizon executed this Agreement (including the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) in paper form.

22. Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the Participant shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any of the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph
22 does not prevent the Participant from disclosing the terms of this Agreement to the Participant’s spouse or beneficiary or to the Participant’s legal, tax, or financial adviser,
provided that the Participant take all reasonable measures to assure that the individual to whom disclosure is made does not disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party
except as otherwise required by law.

23. Applicable Law. Except as expressly provided in Exhibit B, the validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

24. Notice. Any notice to the Company provided for in this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative
Officer of Verizon at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 and any notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the current address
shown on the payroll of the Company, or to such other address as the Participant may designate to the Company in writing. Any notice shall be delivered by hand, sent by
telecopy, sent by overnight carrier, or enclosed in a properly sealed envelope as stated above, registered and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post office regularly maintained by
the United States Postal Service.

25. Dispute Resolution.

(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 26 below, all disputes arising under or related to the Plan or this Agreement and all claims in which a Participant
seeks damages or other relief that relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan are subject to the dispute resolution procedure described below in this paragraph
25.

(i)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Award Dispute” shall mean any claim against the Company or a Related Company, other than Units
Damages Disputes described in paragraph (a)(ii) below, regarding (A) the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, (B) any of the terms or conditions of
the RSUs issued under this Agreement, or (C) allegations of entitlement to RSUs or additional RSUs, or any other benefits, under the Plan or this Agreement;
provided, however, that any dispute relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or to the forfeiture
of an award as a result of a breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall not be subject
to the dispute resolution procedures provided for in this paragraph 25.

(ii)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Damages Dispute” shall mean any claims between the Participant and the Company or a Related
Company (or against the past or present directors, officers, employees, representatives, or agents of the Company or a Related Company, whether acting in
their capacity as such or otherwise),

4

that are related in any way to the Participant’s employment or former employment, including claims of alleged employment discrimination, wrongful
termination, or violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 42
U.S.C. § 1981, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other U.S. federal, state or local law, statute,
regulation, or ordinance relating to employment or any common law theories of recovery relating to employment, such as breach of contract, tort, or public
policy claims, in which the damages or other relief sought relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan or this Agreement.

(b) Internal Dispute Resolution Procedure. All Units Award Disputes, and all Units Damages Dispute alleging breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims with
respect to the Plan or this Agreement (collectively, “Plan Disputes”), shall be referred in the first instance to the Verizon Employee Benefits Committee (“EB
Committee”) for resolution internally within Verizon. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, all Plan Disputes must be filed in writing with the EB Committee no
later than one year from the date that the dispute accrues. Consistent with paragraph 25(c)(i) of this Agreement, all decisions relating to the enforceability of the
limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the EB Committee shall have full power, discretion, and
authority to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Plan Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement. Determinations made by the EB Committee
shall be final, conclusive and binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to paragraph (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. A
Participant’s failure to refer a Plan Dispute to the EB Committee for resolution will in no way impair the Company’s right to compel arbitration or the enforceability of
the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii).

(c) Arbitration. All appeals from determinations by the EB Committee as described in paragraph (b) above, and any Units Damages Dispute, shall be fully and finally
settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on an individual basis (and not on a collective or class action basis) before a single
arbitrator pursuant to the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time any such arbitration is initiated. Any such arbitration must be initiated in writing
pursuant to the aforesaid rules of the AAA no later than one year from the date that the claim accrues, except where a longer limitations period is required by applicable
law. However, a Participant’s failure to initiate arbitration within one year will in no way impair the Company’s right, exercised at its discretion, to compel arbitration or
the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii). Decisions about the applicability of the limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. A copy
of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The Participant agrees that the arbitration shall be held at the office of the AAA
nearest the place of the Participant’s most recent employment by the Company or a Related Company, unless the parties agree in writing to a different location. All
claims by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A
and B to this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.

(i)    The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all
issues submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy, and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and shall have the
authority to award any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall be upheld unless
such decision was arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and enforceable in any
applicable court.

(ii)    The Participant understands and agrees that, pursuant to this Agreement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive
any right to sue each other in a court of law or equity, to have a trial by jury, or to resolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for
breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), and that the sole forum available
for the resolution of Units Award Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as provided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court
finds that the arbitration provisions of this Agreement are not enforceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand
and agree to waive their right to trial by jury of any Units Award Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute resolution procedure shall not
prevent either the Participant or the Company or a Related Company from commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of obtaining injunctive relief to prevent irreparable harm pending and in aid of arbitration hereunder; in such event, both the Participant
and the Company or a Related Company agree that the party who commences the action may proceed without necessity of posting a bond.

(iii)    In consideration of the Participant’s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and
arbitrator’s fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a
Related Company will reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited
to each party’s attorney’s fees, will be the responsibility of such party.

(iv)    The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units Award Disputes and
Units Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall be
interpreted as broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.

5

(v)    The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the FAA is held not to apply, or if
application of the FAA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the laws
of the State of Delaware shall apply without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

(vi)    To the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan
pursuant to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the Participant’s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to Verizon as
provided under paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.

26. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or
remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause
or to involuntarily terminate the Participant without Cause), the Participant acknowledges that—

(a) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement are essential to the continued goodwill and profitability of the Company
and any Related Company;

(b) The Participant has broad-based skills that will serve as the basis for other employment opportunities that are not prohibited by the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(c) When the Participant’s employment with the Company or any Related Company terminates, the Participant shall be able to earn a livelihood without violating any of
the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(d) Irreparable damage to the Company or any Related Company shall result in the event that the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of any of
such Participant obligations and restrictions;

(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A or B, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy, and no bond or other security shall be required in
connection therewith;

(f) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation
of this Agreement;

(g) The Participant’s breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including, for example, any breach of
the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and

(h) All disputes relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including their interpretation and enforceability
and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead
be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Exhibit A – Participant’s Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, you, the Participant, agree to the following obligations:

1. Effect of a Material Restatement of Financial Results; Recoupment; Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions.

(a) General. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that, with respect to all RSUs granted to you on or after April 9, 2018 and all short-
term incentive awards made to you on or after April 9, 2018, to the extent the Company or any Related Company is required to materially restate any financial results
based upon your willful misconduct or gross negligence while employed by the Company or any Related Company (and where such restatement would have resulted in a
lower payment being made to you), you will be required to repay all previously paid or deferred (i) RSUs and (ii) short-term incentive awards that were provided to you
during the performance periods that are the subject of the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. For purposes of this paragraph, “willful misconduct”
and “gross negligence” shall be as determined by the Committee. The Audit Committee of the Verizon Board of Directors shall determine whether a material restatement
of financial results has occurred. If you do not repay the entire amount required under this paragraph, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset
your obligation to repay against any source of income available to it, including but not limited to any money you may have in your nonqualified deferral accounts.

(b) Requirements of Recoupment Policy or Applicable Law. The repayment rights contained in paragraph 1(a) of Exhibit A shall be in addition to, and shall not limit,
any other rights or remedies that the Company may have under law or in equity, including, without limitation, (i) any right that the Company may have under any
Company recoupment policy that may apply to you, or (ii) any right or obligation that the Company may have regarding the clawback of “incentive-based compensation”
under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as determined by the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) or under any other applicable law. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree and consent to the Company’s
application, implementation and enforcement of any such Company recoupment policy (as it may be in effect from time to time) that may apply to you and any provision
of applicable law relating to cancellation, rescission, payback or recoupment of compensation and expressly agree that the Company may take such actions as are
permitted under any such policy (as applicable to you) or applicable law, such as the cancellation of RSUs and repayment of amounts previously paid or deferred with
respect to any previously granted RSUs or short-term incentive awards, without further consent or action being required by you.

(c) Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree to comply with all Company policies regarding trading in
securities or derivative securities (including, without limitation, the Company’s policies prohibiting trading on material inside information regarding the Company or any
business with which the Company does business, the Company’s policies prohibiting engaging in financial transactions that would allow you to benefit from a
devaluation of the Company’s securities, and any additional policy that the Company may adopt prohibiting you from hedging your economic exposure to the Company’s
securities), as such policies are in effect from time to time and for as long as such policies are applicable to you.

2. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit A, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached.

3. Agreement to Participant’s Obligations. You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit A in accordance with the instructions
provided in the Agreement, and your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of such obligations and restrictions. As stated in paragraph 21 of the
Agreement, you and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be
legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit A in paper form.

7

Exhibit B – Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached, you (the Participant) and the Company or any Related Company which employs or employed you, agree to the
following obligations:

1. Non-competition.

(a) Prohibited Conduct. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months following a
termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(1) personally engage in Competitive Activities (as defined below); or

(2) work for, own, manage, operate, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or provide consulting or advisory services to, any
person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or any company or person affiliated with such person,
partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities; provided that your purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of
securities of a publicly traded company shall not constitute “ownership” or “participation in the ownership” for purposes of this paragraph so long as your equity
interest in any such company is less than a controlling interest;

provided that this paragraph (a) shall not prohibit you from (i) being employed by, or providing services to, a consulting firm, provided that you do not personally engage
in Competitive Activities or provide consulting or advisory services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive
Activities, or any person or entity affiliated with such person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or (ii) engaging
in the practice of law as an in-house counsel, sole practitioner or as a partner in (or as an employee of or counsel to) a corporation or law firm in accordance with
applicable legal and professional standards. Exception (ii), however, does not apply to any Participant that may be engaging in Competitive Activities or providing
services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, wherein such engagement or services being provided
are not primarily the practice of law.

(b) Competitive Activities. For purposes of the Agreement, to which this Exhibit B is attached,
“Competitive Activities” means any activities relating to products or services of the same or similar type as the products or services (1) which were or are sold (or,
pursuant to an existing business plan, will be sold) to paying customers of the Company or any Related Company, and (2) for which you have any direct or indirect
responsibility or any involvement to plan, develop, manage, market, sell, oversee, support, implement or perform, or had any such responsibility or involvement within
your most recent 24 months of employment with the Company or any Related Company. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an activity shall not be treated as a
Competitive Activity if the geographic marketing area of such same or similar products or services does not overlap with the geographic marketing area for the
applicable products and services of the Company or any Related Company.

(c) Applicability to California. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1(a), the restrictions described in paragraph 1(a) shall not apply to participants whose
principal work location for the Company or Related Company is in the State of California and: (i) whose employment has terminated for any reason; and (ii) who, within
12 months after termination of their employment, engage in any of the activities described in paragraphs 1(a)(1) or 1(a)(2) within the State of California. Nothing in this
paragraph 1(c) shall be deemed to authorize or permit participants to engage in any competitive activities while using confidential or trade secret information of the
Company or any Related Company.

2. Interference With Business Relations. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months
following a termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(a)(i) recruit, induce or solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company or Related Company who was employed by the Company or any Related Company
prior to or as of your termination date and whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while employed by the Company or any
Related Company for employment or for retention as a consultant or service provider to any person or entity, or (ii) provide, directly or indirectly, names or other
information about any employees of the Company or Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while
employed by the Company or any Related Company to any person or entity (other than to the Company or any Related Company) under circumstances that could lead to
the use of any such information for purposes of recruiting or soliciting any such employee for any person or entity;

(b) hire or participate (with another person or entity) in the process of recruiting, soliciting or hiring, directly or indirectly, (other than for the Company or any Related
Company) any person who is then an employee of the Company or any Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information
about, while employed by the Company or any Related Company;

8

(c) interfere, or attempt to interfere, directly or indirectly, with any relationship of the Company or any Related Company with any of its employees, agents, or
representatives;

(d) solicit or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, directly or indirectly, any client, customer, or Prospect (defined below) of the Company or any Related
Company (1) to cease being, or not to become, a customer of the Company or any Related Company, or (2) to divert any business of such customer or Prospect from the
Company or any Related Company; or

(e) otherwise interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to interfere with or disrupt, directly or indirectly, the relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any
Related Company and any of its customers, clients, Prospects, suppliers, vendors, service providers, developers, joint ventures, equity investments or partners, inventors,
consultants, employees, agents, or representatives.

(f) Applicability to California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a participant whose principal work location for the Company or Related Company is in the State of
California and: (i) whose employment has terminated for any reason; and (ii) who, within 12 months after termination of their employment, engages in any of the
activities described in paragraph 2(b), 2(d) or 2(e), within the State of California, then (A) the prohibition on hiring in paragraph 2(b) shall not apply, and (B) the
prohibitions in paragraph 2(d) and 2(e) shall apply but only to the extent that that the participant uses or discloses confidential or trade secret information of the Company
or any Related Company to engage in such activities. Nothing in this paragraph 2(f) shall be deemed to authorize or permit participants to engage in any competitive
activities while using confidential or trade secret information of the Company or any Related Company.

For purposes of this paragraph 2, “Prospect” shall mean any person or entity from whom or which any business was being solicited by Verizon or any Related Company within
the most recent 12 month period of your employment.

3. Proprietary and Confidential Information. You shall at all times, including after any termination of your employment with the Company or any Related Company,
preserve the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information (defined below) and trade secrets of the Company or any Related Company, and you shall not use for the benefit of
yourself or any person, other than the Company or a Related Company, or disclose to any person, except and to the extent that disclosure of such information is authorized
under applicable laws or regulations (e.g., “whistleblower” laws such as 18 USC 1833(b) described below), any Proprietary Information or trade secrets of the Company or any
Related Company. “Proprietary Information” means any information or data related to the Company or any Related Company, including information entrusted to the Company
or a Related Company by others, which has not been fully disclosed to the public by the Company or a Related Company, which is treated as confidential or otherwise
protected within the Company or any Related Company or is of value to competitors, such as strategic or tactical business plans; undisclosed business, operational or financial
data; ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, models, devices, programs, computer software, or related information; documents relating to regulatory matters or
correspondence with governmental entities; information concerning any past, pending, or threatened legal dispute; pricing or cost data; the identity, reports or analyses of
business prospects; business transactions (including those that are contemplated or planned); research data; personnel information or data; identities of suppliers to the
Company or any Related Company or users or purchasers of the Company’s or Related Company’s products or services; the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached; and
any other non-public information pertaining to or known by the Company or a Related Company, including confidential or non-public information of a third party that you
know or should know the Company or a Related Company is obligated to protect. Section 18 USC 1833(b) provides that “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly
liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that—(A) is made—(i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either
directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document
filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.” Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for
disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b).

4. Return of Company Property; Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that on or before termination of your employment for any reason with the
Company or any Related Company, you shall return to the Company all property owned by the Company or any Related Company or in which the Company or any Related
Company has an interest or to which the Company or any Related Company has any obligation, including any and all files, documents, data, records and any other non-public
information (whether on paper or in tapes, disks, memory devices, or other machine-readable form), office equipment, credit cards, and employee identification cards. You
acknowledge that the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company) is the rightful owner of, and you hereby do grant and assign, all right, title and interest in and to any
programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material; and trademarks that you
may have originated, created or developed, or assisted or participated in originating, creating or developing, during your period of employment with the Company or a Related
Company, including all intellectual property rights in or based on the foregoing, where any such origination, creation or development (a) involved any use of Company or
Related Company time, information or resources, (b) was made in the exercise of any of your duties or responsibilities for or on behalf of the Company or a Related Company,
or (c) was related to (i) the Company’s or a Related Company’s past, present or future business, or (ii) the Company’s or a Related Company’s actual or demonstrably
anticipated research, development or procurement activities. You shall at all times, both before and after termination of your employment, cooperate with the Company (or, as
applicable, any Related Company) and its representatives in executing and delivering documents requested by the Company or a Related Company, and taking any other
actions, that are necessary or requested by the Company or a Related Company to assist the Company or any Related Company in patenting, copyrighting, protecting,
registering, or enforcing any programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material;
trademarks; or other intellectual property rights, and to vest title thereto solely in the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company).

9

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4, the restrictions described in paragraph 4 shall not apply to participants whose principal work location for the Company or
Related Company is in the State of California and to any invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of California Labor Code § 2870, which provides as follows:

“§2870. Invention on Own Time - Exemption from Agreement
(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an Employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her
employer shall not apply to an invention that the Employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or
trade secret information except for those inventions that either:
(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of
the employer; or
(2) Result from any work performed by the Employee for the employer.
(b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an Employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned
under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.”

5. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit B, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit B shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached.

6. Agreement to Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations.

(a) You acknowledge that the geographic boundaries, scope of prohibited activities, and time duration of the restrictions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above are

reasonable in nature and are no broader than are necessary to maintain the confidential information, trade secrets and the goodwill of the Company and its Related
Companies and to protect the other legitimate business interests of the Company and its Related Companies and are not unduly restrictive on you. In addition, you
and the Company agree and intend that the covenants contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants and agreements, one for
each and every county or political subdivision of each applicable state of the United States and each country of the world. It is the desire and intent of the parties
hereto that the provisions of this Exhibit B be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the governing laws and public policies of the State of New Jersey, and
to the extent applicable, each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any provision in this Exhibit B or deemed to be included in this Exhibit B
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of the parties hereto, shall be deemed amended to delete or to
modify (including, without limitation, a reduction in duration, geographical area or prohibited business activities) the portion adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such deletion or modification to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made, and such deletion or modification to be made only to the extent necessary to cause the provision as amended to be valid and enforceable.

(b) You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit B in accordance with the instructions provided in the Agreement, and
your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of such obligations and restrictions. As stated in paragraph 21 of the Agreement, you and Verizon
hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and
have the same legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit B in paper form.

7. Governing Law and Non-exclusive Forum. The parties expressly agree: (a) that, because the Plan is centrally administered in the State of New Jersey by employees of a
Verizon Communications Inc. affiliate, the subject matter of this Exhibit B bears a reasonable relationship to the State of New Jersey; (b) that this Exhibit B is made under,
shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to that jurisdiction’s choice of law rules; and (c)
the parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of New Jersey, and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of New Jersey, over any action, claim, controversy or proceeding arising under this Exhibit B, and irrevocably waive any objection they may now or hereafter have to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
SPECIAL PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT

EXHIBIT 10c(x)

AGREEMENT between Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon” or the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.

1. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to the Participant.

2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the 2017 Verizon Communications Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of a
restricted stock unit award in the form of RSUs pursuant to the Plan. In consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good,
valuable and sufficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’s obligations and restrictions
set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement, both of which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By
executing this Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement. In addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Human Resources Committee
of Verizon’s Board of Directors or any successor thereto (the “Committee”), and any designee of the Committee (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

3. Contingency. The grant of RSUs is contingent on the Participant’s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on June 29, 2018, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of RSUs regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“Vesting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent the
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he will not be entitled to this grant of RSUs until such time as
he returns to work with Verizon or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period established by the Company.

4. Number of Units. The Participant is granted the number of RSUs as specified in the Participant’s account under the Special Performance RSU grant, administered by
Fidelity Investments or any successor thereto (“Fidelity”). A RSU is a hypothetical share of Verizon’s common stock. The value of a RSU on any given date shall be equal to
the closing price of Verizon’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as of such date. A Dividend Equivalent Unit (“DEU”) or fraction thereof shall be
added to each RSU each time that a dividend is paid on Verizon’s common stock with respect to each dividend record date that occurs after the date of grant and prior to the
payment of an RSU. The amount of each DEU shall be equal to the corresponding dividend paid on a share of Verizon’s common stock. The DEU shall be converted into
RSUs or fractions thereof based upon the closing price of Verizon’s common stock traded on the NYSE on the dividend payment date of each declared dividend on Verizon’s
common stock, and such RSUs or fractions thereof shall be added to the Participant’s RSU balance. DEUs that are credited will be subject to the same vesting, termination and
other terms as the RSUs to which they relate. To the extent that Fidelity or the Company makes an error, including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the
number or value of the RSUs granted to the Participant under this Agreement, the DEUs credited to the Participant’s account or the amount of the final award payment, the
Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he shall be legally bound by any corrective action taken by
the Company or Fidelity.

5. Vesting.

(a) Time-Based Vesting. The Participant shall vest in one hundred percent (100%) of the total number of RSUs subject to this grant, including DEUs credited with
respect to such RSUs pursuant to the terms hereof (the “Target Number of RSUs”), on April 9, 2021. The Participant must be continuously employed by the Company or a
Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) from the date the RSUs are granted through April 9, 2021 as a condition to vesting of any RSUs hereunder, except as
otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs”) or as otherwise provided by the Committee.

(b) Additional Performance-Based Vesting.

(1) General.  If both (x) the Target Number of RSUs vest pursuant to paragraph 5(a) or Section 7(c)(1) and (y) Oath Inc.’s Revenue (as defined below) during the
three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2020 meets or exceeds xxx Dollars ($xxx), then an additional
number of RSUs shall vest as of April 9, 2021, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Target Number of RSUs.

(2) Definition of Revenue.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Revenue” has the meaning given to such term under GAAP. The Committee will (to the extent
necessary and without duplication) adjust such revenue to eliminate the financial impact of (i) acquisitions, divestitures or changes in business structure; (ii) changes
in legal, tax, accounting or regulatory policy; and

1

(iii) other items that are extraordinary in nature or not deemed to be in the ordinary course of business. The Committee’s determination of whether, and the extent to
which, any such adjustment is necessary shall be final and binding.

(c) Transfer. Transfer of employment from Verizon to a Related Company, from a Related Company to Verizon, or from one Related Company to another Related
Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder, and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for purposes of
the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a).

6. Payment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in shares of Verizon common stock. Subject to paragraph 7(a), as soon as practicable after April 9, 2021 (but in
no event later than 2 and one-half months after such date), the number of shares that vested (minus any withholding for taxes) shall be paid to the Participant. The number of
shares that shall be paid (plus withholding for taxes) shall equal the number of RSUs that vested pursuant to the terms hereof. If the Participant dies before any payment due
hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’s beneficiary, as designated under paragraph 11. Once a payment has been made with respect to a RSU, the
RSU shall be canceled; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this
Agreement, shall remain in effect.

7. Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of RSUs. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, RSUs may vest or be forfeited before the vesting and payment dates set
forth above as follows:

(a) Termination for Cause. If the Participant’s employment by the Company or a Related Company is terminated by the Company or a Related Company for Cause (as
defined below) at any time prior to the date that the RSUs are paid pursuant to paragraph 6, the RSUs (whether vested or not) shall automatically terminate and be
cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(b) Voluntary Separation On or Before April 9, 2021, or Other Separation Not Described in Paragraph 7(c). If the Participant (i) voluntarily separates from
employment on or before April 9, 2021 for any reason, or (ii) otherwise separates from employment on or before April 9, 2021 under circumstances not described in
paragraph 7(c), all then-unvested RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the
Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(c) Involuntary Termination Without Cause On or Before April 9, 2021, Termination Due to Death or Disability On or Before April 9, 2021.

(1) This paragraph 7(c) shall apply if the Participant separates from employment by reason of an involuntary termination without Cause (as determined by the
Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee)), death, or Disability (as defined below) on or before April 9, 2021.

(2) If the Participant separates from employment on or before April 9, 2021 under circumstances described in paragraph 7(c)(1), (x) the Participant’s Target Number
of RSUs shall vest (without prorating the award), and (y) the Participant shall remain eligible to vest in additional RSUs in accordance with paragraph 5(b) (subject
to the performance requirement set forth therein being met), provided in each case that the Participant has not and does not commit a breach of any of the
Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement and provided that the Participant executes, within the time prescribed by
Verizon, a release satisfactory to Verizon waiving any claims he or she may have against Verizon and any Related Company (otherwise, paragraph 7(b) shall apply).

(3) Any RSUs that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(c)(2) shall be payable as provided in paragraph 6.

(4) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

(i) “Cause” means (i) incompetence or negligence in the discharge of, or inattention to or neglect of or failure to perform, the duties and responsibilities
assigned to the Participant; fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; or a material breach of the Verizon Code of Conduct (as in effect at the relevant time)
or any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, all as determined by the Executive Vice President and
Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) in his or her discretion, or (ii) commission of any felony of which the Participant is finally
adjudged guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii) “Disability” shall mean the total and permanent disability of the Participant as defined by, or determined under, the Company’s long-term disability
benefit plan.

(d) Change in Control. If a Participant is involuntarily terminated without Cause within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Verizon
(as defined in the Plan) and before April 9, 2021, the RSUs shall vest (without prorating the award) by deeming the performance goal in paragraph 5(b) and the
continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a) to be satisfied in full; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, shall remain in effect. A Change in Control or an involuntary termination without Cause that
occurs after

2

April 9, 2021 shall have no effect on whether any RSUs vest or become payable under this paragraph 7(d). If both paragraph 7(c) and this paragraph 7(d) would otherwise
apply in the circumstances, this paragraph 7(d) shall control. All payments provided in this paragraph 7(d) shall be made at their regularly scheduled time as specified in
paragraph 6.

(e) Vesting Schedule. Except and to the extent provided in paragraphs 7(c) and (d), nothing in this paragraph 7 shall alter the vesting schedule prescribed by paragraph 5.

8. Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the RSUs until the date on which the Participant becomes the holder of record with
respect to any shares of Verizon common stock to which this grant relates. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or
other rights for which the record date occurs while the RSUs are outstanding.

9. Amendment of Agreement. Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Committee nor the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) may, without the written consent of the Participant, change any term, condition or provision
affecting the RSUs if the change would have a material adverse effect upon the RSUs or the Participant’s rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the
Committee or the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee) from exercising administrative discretion with respect to the
Plan or this Agreement, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. This discretion includes, but is not limited to, corrections of any errors,
including but not limited to any administrative errors, determining the total percentage of RSUs that become payable, and determining whether the Participant has been
discharged for Cause, has a Disability, has breached any of the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or has satisfied the
requirements for vesting and payment under paragraphs 5 and 7 of this Agreement.

10. Assignment. The RSUs shall not be assigned, pledged or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

11. Beneficiary. The Participant shall designate a beneficiary in writing and in such manner as is acceptable to the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer
of Verizon (or his or her designee). Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant with respect to the Participant’s benefits under the Plan and shall
be effective only when filed by the Participant with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If the Participant fails to so designate a beneficiary, or if no such designated
beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary shall be the Participant’s estate.

12. Other Plans and Agreements. Any payment received by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination
of the Participant’s benefits under any pension, savings, life insurance, severance or other benefit plan maintained by Verizon or a Related Company. The Participant
acknowledges that this Agreement or any prior RSU agreement shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any other plans maintained by the
Company or a Related Company.

13. Company and Related Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Company” means Verizon Communications Inc. “Related Company” means (a) any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership or proprietary interest of 50 percent or more at any time
during the term of this Agreement, or (b) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which Verizon Communications Inc. holds a direct or indirect ownership
or other proprietary interest of less than 50 percent at any time during the term of this Agreement but which, in the discretion of the Committee, is treated as a Related
Company for purposes of this Agreement.

14. Employment Status. The grant of the RSUs shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company
and the Participant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ of any such Company or Related Company.

15. Withholding. The Participant acknowledges that he or she shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of RSUs, and the Company shall make
such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

16. Securities Laws. The Company shall not be required to make payment with respect to any shares of common stock prior to the admission of such shares to listing on any
stock exchange on which the stock may then be listed and the completion of any registration or qualification of such shares under any federal or state law or rulings or
regulations of any government body that the Company, in its discretion, determines to be necessary or advisable.

17. Committee Authority. The Committee shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or
construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Committee in its discretion, as described in
paragraph 9. The Committee and the Audit Committee may designate any individual or individuals to perform any of its functions hereunder and utilize experts to assist in
carrying out their duties hereunder.

18. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the RSUs
may have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All

3

terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’s death, to
refer to and be binding upon the Participant’s heirs and beneficiaries.

19. Construction. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’s obligations or restrictions set forth in Exhibits
A and B to this Agreement, is held to be unenforceable for being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent
necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The RSUs are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

20. Defined Terms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the
terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate.

21. Execution of Agreement. The Participant shall indicate his or her consent and acknowledgment to the terms of this Agreement (including the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) and the Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise shall comply with
the requirements of paragraph 3. In addition, by consenting to the terms of this Agreement and the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this
Agreement, the Participant expressly agrees and acknowledges that Fidelity may deliver all documents, statements and notices associated with the Plan and this Agreement to
the Participant in electronic form. The Participant and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance,
agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if the Participant and Verizon executed this Agreement (including the Participant’s
obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement) in paper form.

22. Confidentiality. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, the Participant shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any of the terms of this Agreement. This paragraph
22 does not prevent the Participant from disclosing the terms of this Agreement to the Participant’s spouse or beneficiary or to the Participant’s legal, tax, or financial adviser,
provided that the Participant take all reasonable measures to assure that the individual to whom disclosure is made does not disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party
except as otherwise required by law.

23. Applicable Law. Except as expressly provided in Exhibit B, the validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

24. Notice. Any notice to the Company provided for in this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative
Officer of Verizon at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 and any notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the current address
shown on the payroll of the Company, or to such other address as the Participant may designate to the Company in writing. Any notice shall be delivered by hand, sent by
telecopy, sent by overnight carrier, or enclosed in a properly sealed envelope as stated above, registered and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post office regularly maintained by
the United States Postal Service.

25. Dispute Resolution.

(a)    General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 26 below, all disputes arising under or related to the Plan or this Agreement and all claims in which a
Participant seeks damages or other relief that relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan are subject to the dispute resolution procedure described below in this
paragraph 25.

(i)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Award Dispute” shall mean any claim against the Company or a Related Company, other than Units Damages
Disputes described in paragraph (a)(ii) below, regarding (A) the interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, (B) any of the terms or conditions of the RSUs issued
under this Agreement, or (C) allegations of entitlement to RSUs or additional RSUs, or any other benefits, under the Plan or this Agreement; provided, however, that
any dispute relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement or to the forfeiture of an award as a result of a
breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures
provided for in this paragraph 25.

(ii)    For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Units Damages Dispute” shall mean any claims between the Participant and the Company or a Related Company (or
against the past or present directors, officers, employees, representatives, or agents of the Company or a Related Company, whether acting in their capacity as such or
otherwise), that are related in any way to the Participant’s employment or former employment, including claims of alleged employment discrimination, wrongful
termination, or violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 42 U.S.C. §
1981, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any other U.S. federal, state or local law, statute, regulation, or
ordinance relating to employment or any common law theories of recovery relating to employment, such as breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims, in which
the damages or other relief sought relate in any way to RSUs or other benefits of the Plan or this Agreement.

4

(b)    Internal Dispute Resolution Procedure. All Units Award Disputes, and all Units Damages Dispute alleging breach of contract, tort, or public policy claims with
respect to the Plan or this Agreement (collectively, “Plan Disputes”), shall be referred in the first instance to the Verizon Employee Benefits Committee (“EB Committee”)
for resolution internally within Verizon. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, all Plan Disputes must be filed in writing with the EB Committee no later than one
year from the date that the dispute accrues. Consistent with paragraph 25(c)(i) of this Agreement, all decisions relating to the enforceability of the limitations period
contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the EB Committee shall have full power, discretion, and authority to interpret the
Plan and this Agreement and to decide all Plan Disputes brought under this Plan and Agreement. Determinations made by the EB Committee shall be final, conclusive and
binding, subject only to review by arbitration pursuant to paragraph (c) below under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review. A Participant’s failure to refer a Plan
Dispute to the EB Committee for resolution will in no way impair the Company’s right to compel arbitration or the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii).

(c)    Arbitration. All appeals from determinations by the EB Committee as described in paragraph (b) above, and any Units Damages Dispute, shall be fully and finally
settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) on an individual basis (and not on a collective or class action basis) before a single
arbitrator pursuant to the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time any such arbitration is initiated. Any such arbitration must be initiated in writing
pursuant to the aforesaid rules of the AAA no later than one year from the date that the claim accrues, except where a longer limitations period is required by applicable
law. However, a Participant’s failure to initiate arbitration within one year will in no way impair the Company’s right, exercised at its discretion, to compel arbitration or
the enforceability of the waiver in paragraph 25(c)(ii). Decisions about the applicability of the limitations period contained herein shall be made by the arbitrator. A copy
of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules may be obtained from Human Resources. The Participant agrees that the arbitration shall be held at the office of the AAA
nearest the place of the Participant’s most recent employment by the Company or a Related Company, unless the parties agree in writing to a different location. All claims
by the Company or a Related Company against the Participant, except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement, may also be raised in such arbitration proceedings.

(i)    The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether any dispute submitted for arbitration hereunder is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall decide all issues
submitted for arbitration according to the terms of the Plan, this Agreement (except for breaches of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), existing Company policy, and applicable substantive Delaware State and U.S. federal law and shall have the authority to award
any remedy or relief permitted by such laws. The final decision of the EB Committee with respect to a Plan Dispute shall be upheld unless such decision was
arbitrary or capricious. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive, not subject to appeal, and binding and enforceable in any applicable court.

(ii)    The Participant understands and agrees that, pursuant to this Agreement, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company waive any
right to sue each other in a court of law or equity, to have a trial by jury, or to resolve disputes on a collective, or class, basis (except for breaches of any of
the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement), and that the sole forum available for the resolution of Units
Award Disputes and Units Damages Disputes is arbitration as provided in this paragraph 25. If an arbitrator or court finds that the arbitration provisions
of this Agreement are not enforceable, both Participant and the Company or a Related Company understand and agree to waive their right to trial by jury
of any Units Award Dispute or Units Damages Dispute. This dispute resolution procedure shall not prevent either the Participant or the Company or a
Related Company from commencing an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief to prevent irreparable
harm pending and in aid of arbitration hereunder; in such event, both the Participant and the Company or a Related Company agree that the party who
commences the action may proceed without necessity of posting a bond.

(iii) In consideration of the Participant’s agreement in paragraph (ii) above, the Company or a Related Company will pay all filing, administrative and arbitrator’s
fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings. If the AAA requires the Participant to pay the initial filing fee, the Company or a Related Company will
reimburse the Participant for that fee. All other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including but not limited to each party’s attorney’s fees,
will be the responsibility of such party.

(iv) The parties intend that the arbitration procedure to which they hereby agree shall be the exclusive means for resolving all Units Award Disputes and Units
Damages Disputes (subject to the mandatory EB Committee procedure provided for in paragraph 25(b) above). Their agreement in this regard shall be interpreted as
broadly and inclusively as reason permits to realize that intent.

(v) The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) shall govern the enforceability of this paragraph 25. If for any reason the FAA is held not to apply, or if application of the
FAA requires consideration of state law in any dispute arising under this Agreement or subject to this dispute resolution provision, the laws of the State of Delaware
shall apply without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

(vi) To the extent an arbitrator determines that the Participant was not terminated for Cause and is entitled to the RSUs or any other benefits under the Plan pursuant
to the provisions applicable to an involuntary termination without Cause, the Participant’s obligation to execute a release satisfactory to Verizon as provided under
paragraph 7(c)(2) shall remain applicable in order to receive the benefit of any RSUs pursuant to this Agreement.

5

26. Additional Remedies. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and in addition to any other rights or
remedies, whether legal, equitable, or otherwise, that each of the parties to this Agreement may have (including the right of the Company to terminate the Participant for Cause
or to involuntarily terminate the Participant without Cause), the Participant acknowledges that—

(a) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement are essential to the continued goodwill and profitability of the Company
and any Related Company;

(b) The Participant has broad-based skills that will serve as the basis for other employment opportunities that are not prohibited by the Participant’s obligations and
restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(c) When the Participant’s employment with the Company or any Related Company terminates, the Participant shall be able to earn a livelihood without violating any of
the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement;

(d) Irreparable damage to the Company or any Related Company shall result in the event that the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to
this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that monetary damages will not adequately protect the Company and any Related Company from a breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions;

(e) If any dispute arises concerning the violation or anticipated or threatened violation by the Participant of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in
Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, an injunction may be issued restraining such violation pending the determination of such controversy, and no bond or other security
shall be required in connection therewith;

(f) The Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement shall continue to apply after any expiration, termination, or cancellation of
this Agreement;

(g) The Participant’s breach of any of the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including, for example, any breach of
the Participant’s non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality restrictions, shall result in the Participant’s immediate forfeiture of all rights and benefits, including
all RSUs and DEUs, under this Agreement; and

(h) All disputes relating to the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibits A and B to this Agreement, including their interpretation and enforceability
and any damages (including but not limited to damages resulting in the forfeiture of an award or benefits under this Agreement) that may result from the breach of such
Participant obligations and restrictions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration, of paragraph 25 of this Agreement, but shall instead
be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Exhibit A - Participant’s Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, you, the Participant, agree to the following obligations:

1. Effect of a Material Restatement of Financial Results; Recoupment; Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions.

(a) General. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that, with respect to all RSUs granted to you on or after April 9, 2018 and all short-
term incentive awards made to you on or after April 9, 2018, to the extent the Company or any Related Company is required to materially restate any financial results
based upon your willful misconduct or gross negligence while employed by the Company or any Related Company (and where such restatement would have resulted in a
lower payment being made to you), you will be required to repay all previously paid or deferred (i) RSUs and (ii) short-term incentive awards that were provided to you
during the performance periods that are the subject of the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. For purposes of this paragraph, “willful misconduct”
and “gross negligence” shall be as determined by the Committee. The Audit Committee of the Verizon Board of Directors shall determine whether a material restatement
of financial results has occurred. If you do not repay the entire amount required under this paragraph, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset
your obligation to repay against any source of income available to it, including but not limited to any money you may have in your nonqualified deferral accounts.

(b) Requirements of Recoupment Policy or Applicable Law. The repayment rights contained in paragraph 1(a) of Exhibit A shall be in addition to, and shall not limit,
any other rights or remedies that the Company may have under law or in equity, including, without limitation, (i) any right that the Company may have under any
Company recoupment policy that may apply to you, or (ii) any right or obligation that the Company may have regarding the clawback of “incentive-based compensation”
under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as determined by the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) or under any other applicable law. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree and consent to the Company’s
application, implementation and enforcement of any such Company recoupment policy (as it may be in effect from time to time) that may apply to you and any provision
of applicable law relating to cancellation, rescission, payback or recoupment of compensation and expressly agree that the Company may take such actions as are
permitted under any such policy (as applicable to you) or applicable law, such as the cancellation of RSUs and repayment of amounts previously paid or deferred with
respect to any previously granted RSUs or short-term incentive awards, without further consent or action being required by you.

(c) Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions. By accepting this award of RSUs, you agree to comply with all Company policies regarding trading in
securities or derivative securities (including, without limitation, the Company’s policies prohibiting trading on material inside information regarding the Company or any
business with which the Company does business, the Company’s policies prohibiting engaging in financial transactions that would allow you to benefit from a devaluation
of the Company’s securities, and any additional policy that the Company may adopt prohibiting you from hedging your economic exposure to the Company’s securities),
as such policies are in effect from time to time and for as long as such policies are applicable to you.

2. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit A, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached.

3. Agreement to Participant’s Obligations. You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit A in accordance with the instructions

Agreement, you and Verizon hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be
legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit A in paper form.

Exhibit B – Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached, you, the Participant, and the Company or any Related Company which employs or employed you, agree to the
following obligations:

1. Non-competition.

(a) Prohibited Conduct. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months following a
termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(1) personally engage in Competitive Activities (as defined below); or

(2) work for, own, manage, operate, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation, or control of, or provide consulting or advisory services to, any
person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or any company or person affiliated with such person,
partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities; provided that your purchase or holding, for investment purposes, of
securities of a publicly traded company shall not constitute “ownership” or “participation in the ownership” for purposes of this paragraph so long as your equity
interest in any such company is less than a controlling interest;

provided that this paragraph (a) shall not prohibit you from (i) being employed by, or providing services to, a consulting firm, provided that you do not personally engage
in Competitive Activities or provide consulting or advisory services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive
Activities, or any person or entity affiliated with such person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, or (ii) engaging
in the practice of law as an in-house counsel, sole practitioner or as a partner in (or as an employee of or counsel to) a corporation or law firm in accordance with
applicable legal and professional standards. Exception (ii), however, does not apply to any Participant that may be engaging in Competitive Activities or providing
services to any person, partnership, firm, corporation, institution or other entity engaged in Competitive Activities, wherein such engagement or services being provided
are not primarily the practice of law.

(b) Competitive Activities. For purposes of the Agreement, to which this Exhibit B is attached, “Competitive Activities” means any activities relating to products or
services of the same or similar type as the products or services (1) which were or are sold (or, pursuant to an existing business plan, will be sold) to paying customers of
the Company or any Related Company, and (2) for which you have any direct or indirect responsibility or any involvement to plan, develop, manage, market, sell,
oversee, support, implement or perform, or had any such responsibility or involvement within your most recent 24 months of employment with the Company or any
Related Company. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an activity shall not be treated as a Competitive Activity if the geographic marketing area of such same or
similar products or services does not overlap with the geographic marketing area for the applicable products and services of the Company or any Related Company.

(c) Applicability to California. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1(a), the restrictions described in paragraph 1(a) shall not apply to participants whose
principal work location for the Company or Related Company is in the State of California and: (i) whose employment has terminated for any reason; and (ii) who, within
12 months after termination of their employment, engage in any of the activities described in paragraphs 1(a)(1) or 1(a)(2) within the State of California. Nothing in this
paragraph 1(c) shall be deemed to authorize or permit participants to engage in any competitive activities while using confidential or trade secret information of the
Company or any Related Company.

2. Interference With Business Relations. During the period of your employment with the Company or any Related Company, and for a period ending twelve (12) months
following a termination of your employment for any reason with the Company or any Related Company, you shall not, without the prior written consent of the Executive Vice
President and Chief Administrative Officer of Verizon (or his or her designee):

(a)(i) recruit, induce or solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company or Related Company who was employed by the Company or any Related Company
prior to or as of your termination date and whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while employed by the Company or any
Related Company for employment or for retention as a consultant or service provider to any person or entity, or (ii) provide, directly or indirectly, names or other
information about any employees of the Company or Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information about, while
employed by the Company or any Related Company to any person or entity (other than to the Company or any Related Company) under circumstances that could lead to
the use of any such information for purposes of recruiting or soliciting any such employee for any person or entity;

(b) hire or participate (with another person or entity) in the process of recruiting, soliciting or hiring, directly or indirectly, (other than for the Company or any Related
Company) any person who is then an employee of the Company or any Related Company whom you worked with or had contact with, or had confidential information
about, while employed by the Company or any Related Company;

8

(c) interfere, or attempt to interfere, directly or indirectly, with any relationship of the Company or any Related Company with any of its employees, agents, or
representatives;

(d) solicit or induce, or in any manner attempt to solicit or induce, directly or indirectly, any client, customer, or Prospect (defined below) of the Company or any Related
Company (1) to cease being, or not to become, a customer of the Company or any Related Company, or (2) to divert any business of such customer or Prospect from the
Company or any Related Company; or

(e) otherwise interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to interfere with or disrupt, directly or indirectly, the relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any
Related Company and any of its customers, clients, Prospects, suppliers, vendors, service providers, developers, joint ventures, equity investments or partners, inventors,
consultants, employees, agents, or representatives.

(f) Applicability to California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a participant whose principal work location for the Company or Related Company is in the State of
California and: (i) whose employment has terminated for any reason; and (ii) who, within 12 months after termination of their employment, engages in any of the
activities described in paragraph 2(b), 2(d) or 2(e), within the State of California, then (A) the prohibition on hiring in paragraph 2(b) shall not apply, and (B) the
prohibitions in paragraph 2(d) and 2(e) shall apply but only to the extent that that the participant uses or discloses confidential or trade secret information of the Company
or any Related Company to engage in such activities. Nothing in this paragraph 2(f) shall be deemed to authorize or permit participants to engage in any competitive
activities while using confidential or trade secret information of the Company or any Related Company.

For purposes of this paragraph 2, “Prospect” shall mean any person or entity from whom or which any business was being solicited by Verizon or any Related Company within
the most recent 12 month period of your employment.

3. Proprietary and Confidential Information. You shall at all times, including after any termination of your employment with the Company or any Related Company,
preserve the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information (defined below) and trade secrets of the Company or any Related Company, and you shall not use for the benefit of
yourself or any person, other than the Company or a Related Company, or disclose to any person, except and to the extent that disclosure of such information is authorized
under applicable laws or regulations (e.g., “whistleblower” laws such as 18 USC 1833(b) described below), any Proprietary Information or trade secrets of the Company or any
Related Company. “Proprietary Information” means any information or data related to the Company or any Related Company, including information entrusted to the Company
or a Related Company by others, which has not been fully disclosed to the public by the Company or a Related Company, which is treated as confidential or otherwise
protected within the Company or any Related Company or is of value to competitors, such as strategic or tactical business plans; undisclosed business, operational or financial
data; ideas, processes, methods, techniques, systems, models, devices, programs, computer software, or related information; documents relating to regulatory matters or
correspondence with governmental entities; information concerning any past, pending, or threatened legal dispute; pricing or cost data; the identity, reports or analyses of
business prospects; business transactions (including those that are contemplated or planned); research data; personnel information or data; identities of suppliers to the
Company or any Related Company or users or purchasers of the Company’s or Related Company’s products or services; the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached; and
any other non-public information pertaining to or known by the Company or a Related Company, including confidential or non-public information of a third party that you
know or should know the Company or a Related Company is obligated to protect. Section 18 USC 1833(b) provides that “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly
liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that—(A) is made—(i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either
directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document
filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.” Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for
disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b).

4. Return of Company Property; Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. You agree that on or before termination of your employment for any reason with the
Company or any Related Company, you shall return to the Company all property owned by the Company or any Related Company or in which the Company or any Related
Company has an interest or to which the Company or any Related Company has any obligation, including any and all files, documents, data, records and any other non-public
information (whether on paper or in tapes, disks, memory devices, or other machine-readable form), office equipment, credit cards, and employee identification cards. You
acknowledge that the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company) is the rightful owner of, and you hereby do grant and assign, all right, title and interest in and to any
programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material; and trademarks that you
may have originated, created or developed, or assisted or participated in originating, creating or developing, during your period of employment with the Company or a Related
Company, including all intellectual property rights in or based on the foregoing, where any such origination, creation or development (a) involved any use of Company or
Related Company time, information or resources, (b) was made in the exercise of any of your duties or responsibilities for or on behalf of the Company or a Related Company,
or (c) was related to (i) the Company’s or a Related Company’s past, present or future business, or (ii) the Company’s or a Related Company’s actual or demonstrably
anticipated research, development or procurement activities. You shall at all times, both before and after termination of your employment, cooperate with the Company (or, as
applicable, any Related Company) and its representatives in executing and delivering documents requested by the Company or a Related Company, and taking any other
actions, that are necessary or requested by the Company or a Related Company to assist the Company or any Related Company in patenting, copyrighting, protecting,
registering, or enforcing any programs; ideas, inventions and discoveries (patentable or unpatentable); works of authorship, data, information, and other copyrightable material;
trademarks; or other intellectual property rights, and to vest title thereto solely in the Company (or, as applicable, a Related Company).

9

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4, the restrictions described in paragraph 4 shall not apply to participants whose principal work location for the Company or
Related Company is in the State of California and to any invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of California Labor Code § 2870, which provides as follows:

“§2870. Invention on Own Time - Exemption from Agreement
(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an Employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her
employer shall not apply to an invention that the Employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade
secret information except for those inventions that either:
(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of
the employer; or
(2) Result from any work performed by the Employee for the employer.
(b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an Employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned
under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.”

5. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit B, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit B shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is attached.

6. Agreement to Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Other Obligations.

(a)

You acknowledge that the geographic boundaries, scope of prohibited activities, and time duration of the restrictions set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above are

reasonable in nature and are no broader than are necessary to maintain the confidential information, trade secrets and the goodwill of the Company and its Related

Companies and to protect the other legitimate business interests of the Company and its Related Companies and are not unduly restrictive on you. In addition, you and the

Company agree and intend that the covenants contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants and agreements, one for each and every

county or political subdivision of each applicable state of the United States and each country of the world. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions

of this Exhibit B be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the governing laws and public policies of the State of New Jersey, and to the extent applicable, each

jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any provision in this Exhibit A or deemed to be included in this Exhibit A shall be adjudicated to be invalid or

unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of the parties hereto, shall be deemed amended to delete or to modify (including, without limitation, a

reduction in duration, geographical area or prohibited business activities) the portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion or modification to apply

only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made, and such deletion or modification to be made only to

the extent necessary to cause the provision as amended to be valid and enforceable.

(b)

You shall indicate your agreement to the obligations and restrictions set forth in this Exhibit B in accordance with the instructions provided in the Agreement, and

your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of such obligations and restrictions. As stated in paragraph 21 of the Agreement, you and Verizon hereby

expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same

legal force and effect as if you and Verizon executed this Exhibit B in paper form.

7. Governing Law and Non-exclusive Forum. The parties expressly agree: (a) that, because the Plan is centrally administered in the State of New Jersey by employees of a
Verizon Communications Inc. affiliate, the subject matter of this Exhibit B bears a reasonable relationship to the State of New Jersey; (b) that this Exhibit B is made under,
shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to that jurisdiction’s choice of law rules; and (c)
the parties consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of New Jersey, and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of New Jersey, over any action, claim, controversy or proceeding arising under this Exhibit B, and irrevocably waive any objection they may now or hereafter have to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

Re: Amendment of Special Performance Restricted Stock Unit Award

Dear Guru:

I  write  concerning  an  amendment  to  the  special  performance  restricted  stock  unit  award  (“Award”)  previously  granted  to  you  on  April  9,  2018  by  Verizon
Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) pursuant to that certain Special Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between you and Verizon, which you accepted and executed
on June 12, 2018 (the “Award Agreement”).

On  October  5,  2018,  the  Human  Resources  Committee  of  Verizon’s  Board  of  Directors  amended  the  Award  to  increase  the  performance  multiplier  for  the
achievement of the three-year cumulative Verizon Media Group/Oath revenue target from two times to three times the target number of restricted stock units subject to the
Award and to modify the three-year cumulative Verizon Media Group/Oath revenue target to reflect the revised three-year cumulative Verizon Media Group/Oath strategic plan
in effect when you became Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Verizon Media Group/Oath. As a result thereof, Section 5(b)(1) of the Award Agreement is
hereby amended effective as of October 5, 2018 to read as follows:

“(1)  General.  If  both  (x)  the  Target  Number  of  RSUs  vest  pursuant  to  paragraph  5(a)  or  Section  7(c)(1)  and  (y)  Verizon  Media  Group/Oath’s  Revenue  (as
defined below) during the three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2020 meets or exceeds xxx Dollars
($xxx), then an additional number of RSUs shall vest as of April 9, 2021, equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the Target Number of RSUs.”

This letter does not modify any other terms of the Award Agreement except as expressly set forth above.

To indicate your agreement with respect to the foregoing matters, please sign the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me.

Sincerely,
/s/ Todd N. Brooks

Acknowledged and Agreed:

3.3    Decisions Binding. All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and all related orders and resolutions of the
Administrator shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, including the Company, its shareholders, Directors, Non-Employee Directors, Employees, Participants,
and their estates and beneficiaries.

Article 4. Units Subject to the Plan

4.1    Number of Units Available for Grants. Subject to Section 4.2, the maximum number of Units that may be granted under the Plan is Twenty Million Seven Hundred
Four Thousand (20,704,000) Units. No Award may be granted if it would cause the Unit limit of this Section 4.1 to be exceeded.

4.2 Unit Pool Adjustments.

(a) Each Unit subject to the portion of an Award that is paid in the form Shares shall be charged against the Unit Pool.

(b) If all or any portion of an Award is paid in cash or expires or is cancelled, terminated or forfeited for any reason without payment in Shares, the Units subject to

such portion of the Award shall restore, on a one-for-one basis, the number of Units available for grant under the Unit Pool.

Article 5. Eligibility and Participation

5.1    Eligibility. All Employees and Non-Employee Directors are eligible to participate in the Plan.

5.2    Actual Participation. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator may, from time to time, select from all Employees those to whom Awards shall be
granted and shall determine the nature and size of each Award. The Board shall determine the Awards to be granted to the Non-Employee Directors in accordance with the
Company’s compensation program for Non-Employee Directors.

Article 6. Grant and Payment of Units

6.1    Grants. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Awards of Units may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the
Administrator. The Administrator will determine the vesting of each such Award (which may be based on performance criteria, passage of time or other factors or any
combination thereof) and the other terms and conditions of such Award, including designating such Award of Units as Restricted Share Units or Performance Share Units,
which provisions will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.

6.2    Amount of Payment. Each Unit shall represent the right to receive, subject to any vesting requirements applicable to such Unit, an amount equal to (a) the Company
Value as of the applicable Vesting Date, divided by (b) the Total Indicative Units as of the applicable Vesting Date.

4

6.3    Adjustments. In the event of (1) any contribution to the Company’s capital by Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company); (2) any sale of additional
equity interests by the Company; (3) any merger, combination, acquisition, consolidation, sale of a portion of the business or other reorganization of the Company; (4) any
split-up, spin-off or dividend distribution in respect of the Company’s securities in the form of property; or (5) any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction, the
Administrator shall, to such extent (if any) and at such time as it reasonably deems appropriate and equitable in the circumstances, make such adjustments as may be
necessary or appropriate to preserve (and not enlarge or dilute) the intended level of benefits under the Plan, including without limitation by adjusting the Total Indicative
Units in connection with such event. For example, and without limitation, if Verizon contributed assets valued at $1 Billion to the Company at a time when the value of a Unit
(as determined pursuant to Section 6.2 immediately before giving effect to such contribution) was $25, the Administrator could increase the Total Indicative Units by an
additional Forty Million (e.g., if the then-existing amount was 207,040,000, the increase would be from 207,040,000 to247,040,000; $1 Billion divided by $25 is Forty
Million) effective at the time and to account for such contribution. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 6.3 may apply as to any Unit (including Awards then
outstanding) to the extent the Payment Date for such Unit had not occurred prior to the effective time of such adjustment.

6.4    Timing and Form of Payment. Any payment of a vested Unit as provided in this Article 6 shall be made on or following the applicable Payment Date of such Unit as
provided in the Award Agreement. Such payment shall be made in cash; provided, however, that if the Shares are listed or admitted to trade on a national securities exchange
as of the applicable payment date, such payment may be made in the sole discretion of the Administrator, by the Company delivering a number of Shares determined by
dividing (a) the amount of such payment as determined under Section 6.2, by (b) the Fair Market Value of a Share at the time such payment is made.

Article 7. Award Agreements

7.1    In General. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall include such provisions as the Administrator shall determine and that shall specify the
number of Restricted Stock Units granted and the applicable vesting and payment terms.

7.2    Severance from Service. Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have rights, if any, under the Award following the Participant’s
severance from service with the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Award Agreement may make distinctions based on the reason for the Participant’s severance from service
and may contain obligations that apply beyond the term of the Award Agreement.

7.3    Restrictions on Transferability. Unless otherwise expressly approved by the Administrator, a Participant’s Award may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or
otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the
Participant.

7.4    Uniformity Not Required. The provisions of the Award Agreements need not be uniform among all Awards, among all Awards of the same type, among all Awards
granted to the same Participant, or among all Awards granted at the same time.

Article 8. Beneficiary Designation

Each Participant may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be
paid in case of the Participant’s death before the Participant receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same
Participant with respect to such benefit, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and shall be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company
during the Participant’s lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, any benefits remaining unpaid under the Plan at the Participant’s death shall be paid to the
Participant’s estate unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement.

Article 9. Deferrals

Pursuant to the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Administrator may permit or require a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the
delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due in connection with any Awards. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Administrator shall establish rules and
procedures for such deferrals in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

Article 10. No Right to Employment or Participation

10.1    Employment. The Plan shall not interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or Verizon or any Subsidiary of the Company or Verizon to terminate any
Employee’s employment at any time, and the Plan shall not confer upon any Employee the right to continue in the employ of the Company or Verizon or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

10.2    Participation. No Employee or Non-Employee Director shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a
future Award.

5

Article 11. Change in Control.

No outstanding Awards shall vest or become immediately payable or exercisable merely upon the occurrence of a Change in Control. However, if within twelve (12) months
following the occurrence of a Change in Control, a Participant is involuntarily terminated without “Cause” or is deemed to have separated from service as the result of a
“Good Reason”, then any restriction periods and other restrictions imposed on the Participant’s then-outstanding Awards shall lapse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
Awards shall not become payable until their regularly scheduled time as specified under the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement, except that, to the
extent an Award is exempt from Section 409A of the Code under the “short-term deferral rule,” payment shall not be later than 2-1/2 months after the year in which it is no
longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Both “Cause” and “Good Reason” shall be as defined in the applicable Award Agreement.

Article 12. Amendment, Modification, and Termination

12.1    Amendment, Modification, and Termination. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Administrator may at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend, or
terminate the Plan in whole or in part; provided that unless the Administrator specifically provides otherwise, any revision or amendment that would cause the Plan to fail to
comply with any requirement of applicable law, regulation, or rule if such amendment were not approved by the shareholders of the Company shall not be effective unless
and until shareholder approval is obtained.

12.2    Awards Previously Granted. After the termination of the Plan, any previously granted Award shall remain in effect and shall continue to be governed by the terms of
the Plan, the Award, and any applicable Award Agreement. All Awards previously granted under the Plan prior to the Effective Date specified herein shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of the Plan as in effect at such time, provided that all Plan provisions referencing Section 409A of the Code shall apply to all Awards subject to 409A of
the Code.

Article 13. Withholding

13.1    Tax Withholding. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or to require a Participant to remit to the Company or
to Verizon, or any Subsidiary of the Company or Verizon, an amount that the Company or Verizon, or any Subsidiary of the Company or Verizon, reasonably determines to be
required to comply with federal, state, local, or foreign tax withholding requirements.

13.2    Share Withholding. With respect to withholding required in connection with any issuance of Shares pursuant to an Award granted hereunder, the Administrator may
elect to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined
equal to the minimum statutory withholding tax that could be imposed on the transaction.

Article 14. Successors

All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether or not the existence of
such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.

Article 15. Legal Construction

15.1    Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; any feminine term used
herein also shall include the masculine; and the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural.

15.2    Severability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and
the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

15.3    Requirements of Law. The granting and payment of Awards under the Plan (including the issuance of any Shares under the Plan) shall be subject to all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. In addition, the Plan and all Awards
will be interpreted and construed to avoid any tax, penalty or interest under Code Section 409A. The Administrator, in its reasonable discretion, may amend the Plan
(including retroactively) in any manner to conform with Section 409A of the Code. Except for the Company’s obligations to withhold taxes, the Company will have no
obligation relating to any tax or penalty applicable to any person as a result of participation in the Plan.

15.4    Governing Law. The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the legislative or judicial
conflict of laws rules of any state), except to the extent superseded by federal law.

EXHIBIT 10o(i)

AGREEMENT between AOL Inc. (the “Company”) and you (the “Participant”) and your heirs and beneficiaries.

AOL INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
FOUNDERS’ GRANT UNIT AGREEMENT

1. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a grant of Restricted Share Units (“Units”) to the Participant. This award satisfies in full the
Participant’s right to receive a “Founders Incentive Award” with respect to the Company pursuant to the Participant’s offer letter with Verizon Communications Inc. dated May
12, 2015.

2. Agreement. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to the AOL Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and evidences the grant of Units pursuant to the Plan. In
consideration of the benefits described in this Agreement, which Participant acknowledges are good, valuable and sufficient consideration, the Participant agrees to comply
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Participant’s obligations and restrictions set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the “Participant’s
Obligations”) which are incorporated into and are a part of the Agreement. The Units and this Agreement are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. By executing this
Agreement, the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s Obligations. In
addition, the Participant agrees to be bound by the actions of the Administrator (to the extent that such actions are exercised in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this
Agreement). If there is a conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

3. Contingency. The grant of Units is contingent on the Participant’s timely acceptance of this Agreement and satisfaction of the other conditions contained in it. Acceptance
shall be through execution of the Agreement as set forth in paragraph 21. If the Participant does not accept this Agreement by the close of business on September 30, 2015, the
Participant shall not be entitled to this grant of Units regardless of the extent to which the requirements in paragraph 5 (“Vesting”) are satisfied. In addition, to the extent a
Participant is on a Company approved leave of absence, including but not limited to short-term disability leave, he or she will not be entitled to this grant of Units until such
time as he or she returns to active employment with the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph 13) and accepts this Agreement within the time period
established by the Company.

4. Number of Units. Effective on the date the Units are granted (the “Grant Date”), the Participant is granted the number of Units as specified in the Participant’s account
under the “Founders’ 15” grant administered by Fidelity Investments, or any other record keeper appointed by the Company with respect to the Plan or any successor to either
of them (“Fidelity”). A “Unit” is a contingent right to receive a payment as determined under Section 6 of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement. To the extent that
Fidelity or the Company makes an error, including but not limited to an administrative error with respect to the number of Units granted to the Participant under this
Agreement, the Company or Fidelity specifically reserves the right to correct such error at any time and the Participant agrees that he or she shall be legally bound by any
corrective action taken by the Company or Fidelity.

5. Vesting.

(a) General. The Units shall vest as to one-half (1/2) of the Units on June 22, 2018, and as to one-half (1/2) of the Units on June 22, 2019 (each such anniversary date, a
“Vesting Date”). Vesting of the Units is subject in each case to the Participant’s continuous employment by the Company or a Related Company (as defined in paragraph
13) from the Grant Date through the applicable Vesting Date, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 (“Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of Units”) or as
otherwise provided by the Administrator.

(b) Transfer. Transfer of employment from the Company to a Related Company, from a Related Company to the Company, or from one Related Company to another
Related Company shall not constitute a separation from employment hereunder, and service with a Related Company shall be treated as service with the Company for
purposes of the continuous employment requirement in paragraph 5(a). If the Participant transfers employment pursuant to this paragraph 5(b), the Participant will still be
required to satisfy the definition of “Retire” under paragraph 7 of this Agreement in order to be eligible for the accelerated vesting provisions in connection with a
retirement.

6. Payment. Any Units that vest pursuant to the terms hereof shall be paid in the amount and manner provided in Section 6 of the Plan. Such payment shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Vesting Date for such Units (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the Vesting Date). Such payment shall be subject to all applicable tax
withholding. If the Participant dies before any payment due hereunder is made, such payment shall be made to the Participant’s beneficiary, as designated under paragraph 11.
Once a payment has been made with respect to a Unit, the Unit shall be canceled; however, all other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s
Obligations, shall remain in effect.

7. Early Cancellation/Accelerated Vesting of Units. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, Units may vest or be forfeited before the Vesting Date as follows:

1

(a) Termination for Cause. If the Participant’s employment by the Company or a Related Company is terminated by the Company or a Related Company for Cause at
any time prior to the date that the Units are paid pursuant to paragraph 6, the Units (whether vested or not) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the
applicable termination date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(b) Retirement More Than Six Months After Grant Date, Termination Due to Death or Disability, Involuntary Termination without Cause or Termination for
Good Reason On or Before Vesting Date.

(1) This paragraph 7(b) shall apply if the Participant:

(i) Retires (as defined below) on or after the date that is six months after the Grant Date and on or before a Vesting Date,

(ii) Separates from employment by reason of the Participant’s death, or Disability (as defined below) on or before a Vesting Date, or

(iii) Separates from employment by reason of a termination by the Company or a Related Company without Cause (as defined below) or a termination by the
Participant for Good Reason (as defined below), in each case on or before a Vesting Date.

(2) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 7(g), if the Participant separates from employment on or before the Vesting Date under circumstances described in
paragraph 7(b)(1), the continuous employment requirement set forth in paragraph 5(a) shall be deemed satisfied
in full as if the Participant’s employment with the Company had continued through the Vesting Date.

(3) Any Units that vest pursuant to paragraph 7(b)(2) shall be payable at their regularly scheduled time as specified in paragraph 6.

(c)    Retirement Within Six Months of Grant Date, Voluntary Termination or Other Separation Not Described in Paragraph 7(a), 7(b) or 7(d). If the Participant
(i) Retires (as defined in paragraph 7(e)(4)) before the date that is six months after the Grant Date, or (ii) otherwise separates from employment on or before a Vesting
Date under any circumstances not described in paragraph 7(a), 7(b) or 7(d), all the Units shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable termination
date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant.

(d) Change in Control. If a Participant’s employment with the Company or a Related Company is involuntarily terminated without Cause or the Participant voluntarily
terminates employment for Good Reason within twelve (12) months following the occurrence of a Change in Control and before a Vesting Date, then, subject to the
conditions set forth in paragraph 7(g), the Units shall vest and become payable (without prorating the award) and the continuous employment requirement set forth in
paragraph 5(a) shall be deemed satisfied in full as if the Participant’s employment with the Company had continued through the Vesting Date; provided, however, that all
other terms of the Agreement, including but not limited to the Participant’s Obligations, shall remain in effect. A Change in Control or an involuntary termination without
Cause or a voluntary termination for Good Reason that occurs after a particular Vesting Date shall have no effect on whether any Units scheduled to vest on the Vesting
Date vest or become payable under this paragraph 7. If both paragraph 7(b) and this paragraph 7(d) would otherwise apply in the circumstances, this paragraph 7(d) shall
control. Any Units that vest pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) shall be payable at their regularly scheduled time as specified in paragraph 6.

(e) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) “Disability” has the meaning given to such term in an employment agreement between the Company or Related Company and the Participant or, if not defined
therein or if there is no such agreement, “Disability” shall mean the total and permanent disability of the Participant as defined by, or determined under, the
Company’s long-term disability benefit plan.

(2) “Cause” has the meaning given to such term in an employment agreement between the Company or any Related Company and the Participant or, if not defined
therein or if there is no such agreement, “Cause” means (i) incompetence or negligence in the discharge of, or inattention to or neglect of or failure to perform, the
duties and responsibilities assigned to the Participant; fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement; or a material breach of the Company’s Code of Conduct (as in effect
at the relevant time) or any of the Participant’s Obligations, all as determined by the Administrator (or his or her designee) in his or her discretion, or (ii) commission
of any felony of which the Participant is finally adjudged guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(3) “Good Reason” has the meaning given to such term in an employment agreement between the Company or Related Company and the Participant, if any. If there
is no such agreement or if there is such an agreement but such term is not defined therein, the provisions of this Agreement that refer to “Good Reason” shall not
apply, and the Participant shall not be entitled to any accelerated vesting hereunder in connection with any voluntary termination of the Participant’s employment.

(4) “Retire” and “Retirement” means: (i) to retire after having attained at least 15 years of vesting service (as defined under the applicable Company or Related
Company tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan) and a combination of age and years of vesting service that equals or exceeds 75 points, or (ii) retirement under any other
circumstances determined in writing by the Administrator (or his

2

or her designee), provided that, in the case of either (i) or (ii) in this paragraph, the retirement was not occasioned by a discharge for Cause.

(f) Vesting Schedule. Except and to the extent provided in paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d), nothing in this paragraph 7 shall alter the vesting schedule prescribed by
paragraph 5.

(g) Conditions on Accelerated Vesting. Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Plan, the Participant’s right to receive any accelerated vesting of the Units
pursuant to paragraph 7(b) or paragraph 7(d) is subject to the conditions that (i) the Participant has not and does not commit a material breach of any of the Participant’s
Obligations, and (ii) the Participant executes, within the time prescribed by the Company, a release satisfactory to the Company waiving any claims he or she may have
against the Company and any Related Company and does not revoke such release within any revocation period provided by applicable law. If such conditions are not met,
paragraph 7(c) shall apply to the Units.

8. Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Units until the date (if any) on which the Participant becomes the holder of
record with respect to any Shares that may be issued in payment of the Units as provided in Section 6 of the Plan. Except as provided in the Plan or in this Agreement, no
adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs while the Units are outstanding.

9. Amendment of Agreement. Except to the extent required by law or specifically contemplated under this Agreement, neither the Administrator (or his or her designee) may,
without the written consent of the Participant, change any term, condition or provision affecting the Units if the change would have a material adverse effect upon the Units or
the Participant’s rights thereto. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the Administrator (or his or her designee) from exercising administrative discretion with
respect to the Plan or this Agreement, and the exercise of such discretion shall be final, conclusive and binding. This discretion includes, but is not limited to, corrections of
any errors, including but not limited to any administrative errors, and determining whether the Participant has been discharged for Cause, has a Disability, has Retired, has
breached any of the Participant’s Obligations or has satisfied the requirements for vesting and payment under paragraphs 5 and 7 of this Agreement.

10. Assignment. The Units shall not be assigned, pledged or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

11. Beneficiary. The Participant shall designate a beneficiary in writing and in such manner as is acceptable to the Administrator (or his or her designee). Each such
designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant with respect to the Participant’s benefits under the Plan and shall be effective only when filed by the
Participant with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If the Participant fails to so designate a beneficiary, or if no such designated beneficiary survives the Participant,
the Participant’s beneficiary shall be the Participant’s estate.

12. Other Plans and Agreements. Any payment received by the Participant pursuant to this Agreement shall not be taken into account as compensation in the determination
of the Participant’s benefits under any pension, savings, life insurance, severance or other benefit plan maintained by the Company or a Related Company. The Participant
acknowledges that this Agreement or any prior award agreement shall not entitle the Participant to any other benefits under the Plan or any other plans maintained by the
Company or a Related Company.

13. Company and Related Company. For purposes of this Agreement, “Company” means AOL Inc. “Related Company” means (a) Verizon, (b) any Subsidiary of the
Company or Verizon, or (c) any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity in which the Company or Verizon holds a direct or indirect ownership or other
proprietary interest of less than 50 percent at any time during the term of this Agreement but which, in the discretion of the Administrator, is treated as a Related Company for
purposes of this Agreement.

14. Employment Status. The grant of the Units shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment for a particular term between the Company or a Related Company
and the Participant, nor shall it constitute a right to remain in the employ of any such Company or Related Company.

15. Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Withholding. The Participant acknowledges that he shall be responsible for any taxes that arise in connection with this grant of Units, and the Company shall
make such arrangements as it deems necessary for withholding of any taxes it determines are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In the
event the Units are paid in Shares as provided in Section 6 of the Plan, the Administrator may elect to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having
the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory withholding tax that could be imposed on
the transaction in accordance with Section 13.2 of the Plan.

(b) Limitation on Acceleration. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or this Agreement, subject to the terms of any employment agreement between
the Company or any Related Company and the Participant that provides for the treatment of Units that is more favorable to the Participant than this paragraph 15(b), if the
Payment (as hereinafter defined) due to the Participant hereunder as a result of any acceleration of vesting of the Units pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Agreement, either
alone or together with all other Payments received or to be received by the Participant from the Company or any Related Company (collectively, the

3

“Aggregate Payments”), or any portion thereof, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor thereto), the following
provisions shall apply:

(i) If the net amount that would be retained by the Participant after all taxes on the Aggregate Payments are paid would be greater than the net amount that
would be retained by the Participant after all taxes are paid if the Aggregate Payments were limited to the largest amount that would result in no portion of
the Aggregate Payments being subject to such excise tax, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the Aggregate Payments.

(ii) If, however, the net amount that would be retained by the Participant after all taxes were paid would be greater if the Aggregate Payments were limited
to the largest amount that would result in no portion of the Aggregate Payments being subject to such excise tax, the Aggregate Payments to which the
Participant is entitled shall be reduced to such largest amount.

As used herein, the term “Payment” shall mean any transfer of property within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

The determination of whether any reduction of Aggregate Payments is required and the timing and method of any such required reduction in Payments under this
Agreement or in any such other Payments otherwise payable by the Company or any Related Company consistent with any such required reduction, shall be made by the
Participant, including whether any portion of such reduction shall be applied against any cash or any shares of stock of the Company or any other securities or property to
which the Participant would otherwise have been entitled under this Agreement or under any such other Payments, and whether to waive the right to the acceleration of
the Payment due under this Agreement or any portion thereof or under any such other Payments or portions thereof, and all such determinations shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and the Related Companies. To the extent that Payments hereunder or any such other Payments are not paid as a consequence of the limitation
contained in this paragraph 15(b), then the Units (to the extent not so accelerated) and such other Payments (to the extent not vested) shall be deemed to remain
outstanding and shall be subject to the provisions hereof and of the Plan as if no acceleration or vesting had occurred.

The Company shall promptly pay, upon demand by the Participant, all legal fees, court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses which the Participant incurred
in any actual, threatened or contemplated contest of the Participant’s interpretation of, or determination under, the provisions of this paragraph 15(b).

16. Compliance with Laws. The granting and payment of the Units hereunder is subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any
governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.

17. Administrator Authority. The Administrator shall have complete discretion in the exercise of its rights, powers, and duties under this Agreement. Any interpretation or
construction of any provision of, and the determination of any question arising under, this Agreement shall be made by the Administrator in its discretion, as described in
paragraph 9. The Administrator may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary functions to individuals who are officers or employees of the Company or a Related Company or to
third parties.

18. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, any successor or successors of the Company and the person or entity to whom the Units may
have been transferred by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or beneficiary designation. All terms and conditions of this Agreement imposed upon the Participant shall,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, be deemed, in the event of the Participant’s death, to refer to and be binding upon the Participant’s heirs and beneficiaries.

19. Construction. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder
of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision, including any of the Participant’s Obligations, is held to be unenforceable for
being unduly broad as written, such provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable according to
applicable law and shall be enforced as amended. The Units are intended not to be subject to any tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement
shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent.

20. Defined Terms. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions ascribed to them by the Plan, and the
terms of the Plan shall apply where appropriate.

21. Execution of Agreement. The Participant shall indicate his consent and acknowledgment to the terms of this Agreement (including the Participant’s Obligations) and the
Plan by executing this Agreement pursuant to the instructions provided and otherwise shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 3. In addition, by consenting to the
terms of this Agreement and the Participant’s Obligations, the Participant expressly agrees and acknowledges that Fidelity or the Company may deliver all documents,
statements and notices associated with the Plan and this Agreement to the Participant in electronic form. The Participant and the Company hereby expressly agree that the use
of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and have the same legal force and effect as if the
Participant and the Company executed this Agreement (including the Participant’s Obligations) in paper form.

22.    Applicable Law. The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

4

23.    Waiver of Jury Trial. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law which cannot be waived, each party hereto hereby waives, and covenants that it will not assert
(whether as plaintiff, defendant or otherwise), any right to trial by jury in any forum in respect of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this

Exhibit A – Participant’s Obligations

As part of the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, you, the Participant, agree to the following obligations:

1. Effect of a Material Restatement of Financial Results; Recoupment; Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions

(a) General. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that, with respect to all Units granted to you on or after June 23, 2015 and all short-
term incentive awards made to you on or after June 23, 2015, to the extent the Company or any Related Company is required to materially restate any financial results
based upon your willful misconduct or gross negligence while employed by the Company or any Related Company (and where such restatement would have resulted in a
lower payment being made to you), you will be required to repay all previously paid (i) Units and (ii) short-term incentive awards that were provided to you during the
performance periods that are the subject of the restated financial results, plus a reasonable rate of interest. For purposes of this paragraph, “willful misconduct” and “gross
negligence” shall be as determined by the Administrator. The Board (or, in the case of the financial results of Verizon, the Audit Committee of the Verizon Board of
Directors) shall determine whether a material restatement of financial results has occurred. If you do not repay the entire amount required under this paragraph, the
Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset your obligation to repay against any source of income available to it, including but not limited to any
money you may have in your nonqualified deferral accounts (if any).

(b) Requirements of Recoupment Policy or Applicable Law. The repayment rights contained in paragraph 1(a) of Exhibit A shall be in addition to, and shall not limit,
any other rights or remedies that the Company may have under law or in equity, including, without limitation, (i) any right that the Company or any Related Company
may have under any Company or Related Company recoupment policy that may apply to you, or (ii) any right or obligation that the Company or any Related Company
may have regarding the clawback of “incentive-based compensation” under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as determined by the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) or under any other applicable law. By
accepting this award of Units, you agree and consent to the application, implementation and enforcement by the Company or any Related Company of any such
recoupment policy (as it may be in effect from time to time) that may apply to you and any provision of applicable law relating to cancellation, rescission, payback or
recoupment of compensation and expressly agree that the Company and any Related Company may take such actions as are permitted under any such policy (as
applicable to you) or applicable law, such as the cancellation of Units and repayment of amounts previously paid with respect to any previously granted Units or short-
term incentive awards, without further consent or action being required by you.

(c) Company Policies Regarding Securities Transactions. By accepting this award of Units, you agree to comply with all Company and Related Company policies
regarding trading in securities or derivative securities (including, without limitation, any such policies prohibiting trading on material inside information regarding the
Company or a Related Company or any business with which the Company or a Related Company does business, any such policies prohibiting engaging in financial
transactions that would allow you to benefit from a devaluation of the securities of the Company or a Related Company, and any additional policy that the Company or a
Related Company may adopt prohibiting you from hedging your economic exposure to the securities of the Company or a Related Company), as such policies are in
effect from time to time and for as long as such policies are applicable to you.

2. Noncompetition and Other Restrictive Covenants. You and the Company are parties to an Employment Agreement dated March 29, 2012 (the “Employment Agreement”)
that contains noncompetition and other restrictive covenants and a Confidentiality and Inventions Assignment Agreement dated March 29, 2012 (the “Confidentiality
Agreement”) that contains non-solicitation and other restrictive covenants. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Employment Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement and your obligations under each such agreement continue in effect and that such obligations constitute part of these Participant’s Obligations for all purposes under
the Agreement.

3. Definitions. Except where clearly provided to the contrary or as otherwise defined in this Exhibit A, all capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A shall have the definitions
given to those terms in the Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached.

4. Agreement to Participant’s Obligations. You shall indicate your agreement to these Participant’s Obligations in accordance with the instructions provided in the
Agreement, and your acceptance of the Agreement shall include your acceptance of these Participant’s Obligations. As stated in paragraph 21 of the Agreement, you and the
Company hereby expressly agree that the use of electronic media to indicate confirmation, consent, signature, acceptance, agreement and delivery shall be legally valid and
have the same legal force and effect as if you and the Company executed these Participant’s Obligations in paper form.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. We have a highly diverse
workforce of approximately 144,500 employees as of December 31, 2018.

To compete effectively in today’s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks with a goal of future growth
based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. During 2018, we focused on leveraging our network leadership, retaining and growing our high-
quality customer base while balancing profitability, enhancing ecosystems in growth businesses, and driving monetization of our networks and solutions. Our strategy requires
significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber-
optic network that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system
capabilities. We believe that steady and consistent investments in our networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.

We are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to extend our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks.
Our Intelligent Edge Network design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure within the core and providing flexibility at the edge of the
network to meet customer requirements. In addition, protecting the privacy of our customers’ information and the security of our systems and networks will continue to be a
priority at Verizon. Our network leadership will continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength at the connectivity, platform and solutions layers
upon which we build our competitive advantage.

Highlights of Our 2018 Financial Results

(dollars in millions)

Business Overview

We  have  two  reportable  segments,  Wireless  and  Wireline,  which  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  and  organize  by  products  and  services,  and  customer
groups, respectively.

Revenue by Segment

———
Note: Excludes eliminations.

Wireless

Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications products and services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the
United States (U.S.). We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer, business and government customers across the U.S. on a postpaid and prepaid basis. A retail
postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in
return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in
advance. Our wireless customers also include other companies who resell network services to their end-users using our network. Our reseller customers are billed for services
in arrears.

We are focusing our wireless capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. We are densifying  our 4G LTE network by
utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile
video  consumption  and  the  growing  demand  for Internet  of  Things (IoT) products  and  services,  but  also  positions  us  for  the  deployment  of  5G  technology.  Over  the  past
several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We believe
5G  technology  can  provide  users  with  eight  capabilities,  or  currencies.  The  eight  currencies  are  peak  data  rates,  mobile  data  volumes,  mobility,  connected  devices,  energy
efficiency, service deployment, latency and reliability. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards
and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower
latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. During 2018, we commercially launched 5G Home, our alternative
to wired home broadband, on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets; Sacramento, Los Angeles, Houston and Indianapolis. Total Wireless segment operating revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $91.7 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 4.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

Wireline

Our Wireline  segment  provides  communications  products  and  enhanced  services,  including  video  and  data  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed
network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government
customers both in the U.S. and around the world.

In our Wireline business, to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products (such as voice services), we continue to build our Wireline business
around a fiber-based network supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We continue to seek
ways to increase revenue, further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment. We are reinventing our network architecture around a
common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses. We expect our "multi-use fiber" Intelligent Edge Network initiative will create opportunities
to generate revenue from fiber-based services in our Wireline business. Total Wireline segment operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $29.8 billion,
a decrease of $0.9 billion, or 3.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

Corporate and Other

Corporate  and  other  includes  the  results  of  our  Media  business,  Verizon  Media,  which  operated  in  2018  under  the  "Oath"  brand,  our  telematics  business,  branded  Verizon
Connect, and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and
financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing
segment performance due to their nature. Although

such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not
individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.

Verizon Media, our organization that combined Yahoo! Inc.'s (Yahoo) operating business with our pre-existing Media business, includes diverse media and technology brands
that  engage  users  around  the  world.  Our  strategy  is  built  on  providing  consumers  with  owned  and  operated  search  properties  and  finance,  news,  sports  and  entertainment
offerings and providing other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising platforms. Total operating revenues for our Media business, branded Oath
and  included  in  Corporate  and  other,  were  $7.7  billion  for  the  year  ended,  December  31,  2018.  This  was  an  increase  of  28.8%  from  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,
primarily due to the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business in June of 2017.

We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging IoT market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform
layers.  During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,  we  recognized  IoT  revenues  (including  Verizon  Connect)  of  $1.6 billion  and  $1.5 billion,  an  11%  and  52%
increase, respectively, compared to the prior year.

Capital Expenditures and Investments

We continue to invest in our wireless network, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. During the
year ended December 31, 2018, these investments included $16.7 billion for capital expenditures. See "Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities" and "Operating Environment
and Trends" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient,
reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy.

Recent Developments

In September 2018, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 10,400 eligible employees will separate
from the Company under this program by the end of June 2019, with nearly half of these employees having exited in December of 2018. Principally as a result of this program
but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion ($1.4 billion after-tax) during the year ended December
31, 2018, which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2018, we also recorded $0.3 billion in severance
costs under our other existing separation plan.

In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. We continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.

Consolidated Results of Operations

In this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment results. In "Segment Results of Operations," we

Consolidated revenues increased $4.8 billion, or 3.8%, during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in revenues at our Wireless segment, partially offset by a
decline in revenues at our Wireline segment. Also contributing to the increase in consolidated revenues during 2018 was an increase within Corporate and other. In addition,
$0.4 billion of the increase in consolidated revenues was attributable to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606).

Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."

Corporate  and  other  revenues  increased  $1.6  billion,  or  16.6%,  during  2018  compared  to  2017  primarily  due  to  an  increase  of  $1.7  billion  in  revenues  within  our  Media
business, branded Oath, as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017, partially offset

by the sale of 23 customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America in our Wireline segment (Data Center Sale) in May 2017 and other insignificant transactions
(see "Operating Results From Divested Businesses" below).

2017 Compared to 2016

Consolidated revenues remained consistent during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decline in revenues at our Wireless segment, offset by an increase in revenues
within Corporate and other.

Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."

Corporate and other revenues increased $1.6 billion, or 20.7%, during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's
operating business on June 13, 2017, as well as fleet service revenue growth in our telematics business. These increases were partially offset by the sale (Access Line Sale) of
our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and
high-speed internet (HSI) services and long distance voice accounts in these three states, to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) on April 1, 2016 and the Data
Center  Sale  on  May  1,  2017,  and  other  insignificant  transactions  (see  "Operating  Results  From  Divested  Businesses"  below).  During  2017,  Oath  generated  $6.0  billion  in
revenues which represented approximately 64% of revenues in Corporate and Other.

Operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Segment Results of Operations."

2018 Compared to 2017

Cost of Services

Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network
access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support, and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer
care costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.

Cost of services increased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%, during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating
business and an increase in rent expense at our Wireless segment and an increase in content costs associated with continued programming license fees and other direct costs at
our Wireline segment.

Wireless Cost of Equipment

Wireless cost of equipment increased $1.2 billion, or 5.3%, during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily  as  a  result  of  shifts  to  higher  priced  units  in  the  mix  of  devices  sold,
partially offset by declines in the number of smartphones sold.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense includes: salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product, bad debt charges, taxes other than income
taxes, advertising and sales commission costs, customer billing, call center and information technology costs, regulatory fees, professional service fees, and rent and utilities for
administrative space. Also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed in "Cost of Services" above.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased $2.5 billion, or 8.7%, during 2018 primarily due to a net gain on the sale of divested businesses in 2017 (see "Special
Items"),  as  well  as  an  increase  in  severance  expenses  in  2018  primarily  a  result  of  the  voluntary  separation  program  for  selected  U.S.-based  management  employees  (see
"Severance, pension and benefit charges (credits)" under "Special Items"). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition and integration related charges
primarily  related  to  the  acquisition  of  Yahoo's  operating  business  (see  "Special  Items")  and  a  decrease  in  commission  expense  at  both  our  Wireless  and  Wireline  segments
following the adoption of Topic 606.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.4 billion, or 2.6%, during 2018 primarily due to an increase in depreciable assets at our Wireless segment.

Oath Goodwill Impairment

The goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2018 related to our Media business, branded Oath, and was a result of the company's annual goodwill impairment test performed
in the fourth quarter (see "Critical Accounting Estimates").

2017 Compared to 2016

Cost of Services

Cost of services increased $0.5 billion, or 1.5%, during 2017 primarily due to an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business, an increase in
content costs associated with continued programming license fee increases and an increase in access costs as a result of the acquisition of XO Holdings' wireline business (XO)
at our Wireline segment. These increases were partially offset by the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016, the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017 and other
insignificant transactions (see "Operating Results From Divested Businesses"), the fact that we did not incur incremental costs in 2017 as a result of the union work stoppage
that commenced on April 13, 2016 and ended on June 1, 2016 (2016 Work Stoppage).

Wireless Cost of Equipment

Wireless cost of equipment decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.4%, during 2017, primarily as a result of a decline in the number of smartphone and Internet units sold, substantially
offset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling,  general and administrative expense increased  $0.5  billion,  or  1.7%,  during  2017  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  expenses  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  Yahoo's
operating  business  on  June  13,  2017,  acquisition  and  integration  charges  primarily  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  Yahoo's  operating  business,  product  realignment
charges (see "Special Items") and an increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of XO. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the net gain on sale of
divested businesses (see "Special Items"), a decline at our Wireless segment in sales commission expense, employee related costs, bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense, and a decrease due to the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016 and the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017, and other insignificant transactions (see "Operating
Results From Divested Businesses").

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.0 billion, or 6.4%, during 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions of Yahoo's operating business and XO.

Operating Results From Divested Businesses

In  April  2016,  we  completed  the  Access  Line  Sale.  In  May  2017,  we  completed  the  Data  Center  Sale.  The  results  of  operations  related  to  these  divestitures  and  other
insignificant  transactions  are  included  within  Corporate  and  other  for  all  periods  presented  to  reflect  comparable  segment  operating  results  consistent  with  the  information
regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. The results of operations related to these divestitures included within Corporate and other are as follows:

The change in Other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the similar period in 2017, was primarily driven by pension and benefits
credits of $2.1 billion recorded during 2018, compared with pension and benefit charges of approximately $0.9 billion recorded in 2017 (see "Special Items") as well as early
debt redemption costs of $0.7 billion recorded during 2018, compared to $2.0 billion recorded during 2017 (see "Special Items"). The change in Other income (expense), net
during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the similar period in 2016, was primarily driven by a decrease in components of net periodic benefit cost. The change
was  partially  offset  by  early  debt  redemption  costs  of  $2.0 billion,  compared  to  $1.8 billion  recorded  during  2016  (see  "Special  Items"),  as  well  as  a  net  loss  on  foreign
currency translation adjustments compared to a net gain in the 2016 period.

The effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision (benefit) for income taxes by income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2018 was
18.3% compared to (48.3)% for 2017. The increase in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash income
tax benefit of $16.8 billion recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the
enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017. In addition, the current period provision for income taxes includes the tax impact of the Oath goodwill
impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the current year reduction in the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective
January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within the
Wireless business.

In  December  2017,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  staff  issued  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (SAB)  118  to  provide  guidance  for  companies  that  had  not
completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a
provisional  estimate  of  the  impacts  of  the  TCJA  in  our  earnings  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2017,  as  well  as  up  to  a  one  year  measurement  period  that  ended  on
December  22,  2018,  for  any  subsequent  adjustments  to  such  provisional  estimate.    Pursuant  to  SAB  118,  Verizon  recorded  a  provisional  estimate  of  $16.8  billion  for  the
impacts of the TCJA, primarily due to the re-

measurement  of  its  U.S.  deferred  income  tax  liabilities  at  the  lower  21%  U.S.  federal  corporate  income  tax  rate,  with  no  significant  impact  from  the  transition  tax  on
repatriation, the implementation of the territorial tax system, or limitations on the deduction of interest expense.  Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA,
including analyzing the effects of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year
measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion provisional amount previously recorded.

The  effective  income  tax  rate  for  2017  was  (48.3)%  compared  to  35.2%  for  2016.  The  decrease  in  the  effective  income  tax  rate  and  the  provision  for  income  taxes  was
primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the TCJA described above.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (Consolidated EBITDA) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which are presented below,
are  non-GAAP  measures  that  we  believe  are  useful  to  management,  investors  and  other  users  of  our  financial  information  in  evaluating  operating  profitability  on  a  more
variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in
evaluating operating performance in relation to Verizon’s competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization
expenses to net income.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses of unconsolidated
businesses and other income and expense, net, as well as the effect of special items. We believe that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our
financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business
performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing
impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to
prior period performance and trend analysis. See "Special Items" for additional information.

It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by
the  reader  in  addition  to,  but  not  instead  of,  the  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Each  non-GAAP  financial  measure  is  presented  along  with  the
corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that non-GAAP measures provide relevant and
useful information, which is used by management, investors and other users of our financial information as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and
segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to
that of other companies.

Segment Results of Operations

We  have  two  reportable  segments,  Wireless  and  Wireline,  which  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  and  organize  by  products  and  services,  and  customer
groups, respectively. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income. The use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief
operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance.

Segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Segment EBITDA), which is presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an
alternative  to  operating  income  (loss)  as  a  measure  of  operating  performance.  We  believe  this  measure  is  useful  to  management,  investors  and  other  users  of  our  financial
information  in  evaluating  operating  profitability  on  a  more  variable  cost  basis  as  it  excludes  the  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  related  primarily  to  capital
expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by
adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income (loss). Segment EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment
operating revenues.

You can find additional information about our segments in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

(3) ARPA  and  I-ARPA  for  periods  beginning  after  January  1,  2018  reflect  the  adoption  of  Topic  606.  ARPA  and  I-ARPA  for  periods  ending  prior  to  January  1,  2018  were

calculated based on the guidance per ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition." Accordingly, amounts are not calculated on a comparative basis.

2018 Compared to 2017

Wireless’ total operating revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 4.8%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily as a result of increases in equipment and other revenues, partially
offset by a decrease in service revenues.

Accounts and Connections

Retail postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services.
Accounts include unlimited plans, shared data plans and corporate accounts, as well as legacy single connection plans and family plans. A single account may include monthly
wireless services for a variety of connected devices.

Retail connections represent our retail customer device postpaid and prepaid connections. Churn is the rate at which service to connections is terminated on a monthly basis.
Retail  connections  under  an  account  may  include  those  from  smartphones  and  basic  phones  (collectively,  phones)  as  well  as  tablets  and  other  Internet  devices,  including
wearables and retail IoT devices. The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth
for the industry. Retail postpaid connection net additions increased during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in retail postpaid connection gross additions,
including wearables.

Retail Postpaid Connections per Account

Retail postpaid connections per account is calculated by dividing the total number of retail postpaid connections by the number of retail postpaid accounts as of the end of the
period. Retail postpaid connections per account increased 2.2% as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.  The  increase  in  retail  postpaid  connections  per
account is primarily due to an increase in Internet devices, including tablets and other connected devices, which represented 19.7% of our retail postpaid connection base as of
December 31, 2018 compared to 19.0% as of December 31, 2017. The increase in Internet devices is primarily driven by other connected devices, primarily wearables, as of
December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.

Service Revenue

Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased $0.1 billion, or 0.2%, during 2018
compared to 2017, primarily due to a lower amount of revenue allocated to service revenue following the adoption of Topic 606, as well as decreased overage revenue. This
decrease was partially offset by an increase in access revenue. Overage revenue pressure began in 2017, following the introduction of unlimited pricing plans, and has subsided
now that the pace of transition to consumer plans with features that limit overages has reduced.

Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing was driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. Phone
activations under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 78% of retail postpaid phones activated for both 2018 and 2017. At December  31,  2018,
approximately  85%  of  our  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  were  on  unsubsidized  service  pricing  compared  to  approximately  80%  at  December  31,  2017.  At
December  31,  2018,  approximately  48%  of  our  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  had  a  current  participation  in  the  Verizon  device  payment  program  compared  to
approximately 49% at December 31, 2017. The pace of migration to unsubsidized price plans is approaching steady state, as the majority of customers are on such plans at
December 31, 2018.

Service  revenue  plus  recurring  device  payment  plan  billings  related  to  the  Verizon  device  payment  program,  which  represents  the  total  value  invoiced  from  our  wireless
connections, increased $1.5 billion, or 2.0%, during 2018 compared to 2017.

Retail postpaid ARPA (the average service revenue per account from retail postpaid accounts), which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the
Verizon device payment program, decreased 1.1% during 2018 compared to 2017, as a result of a lower amount of revenue allocated to service revenue following the adoption
of Topic 606, partially offset by an increase in service revenue driven by customers shifting to higher access plans. Retail postpaid I-ARPA (the average service revenue per
account from retail postpaid accounts plus recurring device payment plan billings), which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis from our retail
postpaid accounts, increased 1.4% during 2018  compared  to  2017.  This  increase  was  driven  by  an  increase  in  recurring  device  payment  plan  billings,  partially  offset  by  a
decline in service revenue, primarily as a result of a lower amount of revenue allocated to service revenue following the adoption of Topic 606.

Equipment Revenue

Equipment revenue increased $3.4 billion, or 17.8%, during 2018 compared to 2017, as a result of a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold and a higher amount
of revenue allocated to equipment revenue following the adoption of Topic 606. See Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These
increases were partially offset by overall declines in device sales.

Other Revenue

Other revenue includes non-service revenues such as regulatory fees, cost recovery surcharges, revenues associated with our device protection package, sublease rentals and
financing revenue. Other revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 17.4%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to volume and rate-driven increases in revenues related to our
device protection package.

2017 Compared to 2016

Wireless’ total operating revenues decreased $1.7 billion, or 1.9%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in service revenues, partially offset by an
increase in equipment revenues.

Accounts and Connections

Retail postpaid connection net additions decreased 8.9% during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in disconnects of Internet devices, partially offset by a
decline in phone disconnects.

Retail Postpaid Connections per Account

Retail postpaid connections per account increased 2.0% as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in Internet devices, including
tablets and other connected devices, which represented 19.0% of our retail postpaid connection base as of December 31, 2017 compared to 18.3% as of December 31, 2016.

Service Revenue

Service revenue, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased $3.5 billion, or 5.2%, during 2017
compared  to  2016,  primarily  due  to  lower  postpaid  service  revenue,  including  decreased  overage  revenue  and  decreased  access  revenue.  Overage  revenue  pressure  was
primarily  related  to  the  introduction  of  unlimited  pricing  plans  in  2017  and  the  ongoing  migration  to  the  pricing  plans  introduced  in  2016  that  feature  safety  mode  and
carryover data. Service revenue was also negatively impacted as a result of the ongoing customer migration to plans with unsubsidized service pricing.

Customer migration to unsubsidized service pricing was driven in part by an increase in the activation of devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program. For
2017, phone activations under the Verizon device payment program represented approximately 78% of retail postpaid phones activated compared to approximately 77% during
2016.  At  December  31,  2017,  approximately  80%  of  our  retail  postpaid  phone  connections  were  on  unsubsidized  service  pricing  compared  to  approximately  67%  at
December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, approximately 49% of our retail postpaid phone connections participated in the Verizon device payment program compared to
approximately 46% at December 31, 2016.

Service  revenue  plus  recurring  device  payment  plan  billings  related  to  the  Verizon  device  payment  program,  which  represents  the  total  value  invoiced  from  our  wireless
connections, decreased $0.6 billion, or 0.8%, during 2017 compared to 2016.

Retail postpaid ARPA, which does not include recurring device payment plan billings related to the Verizon device payment program, decreased 5.8% during 2017 compared to
2016  as  a  result  of  customer  migration  to  plans  with  unsubsidized  service  pricing,  including  our  new  price  plans  launched  during  2016,  which  feature  safety  mode  and
carryover data, and the introduction of unlimited data plans in 2017. Retail postpaid I-ARPA, which represents the monthly recurring value received on a per account basis
from our retail postpaid accounts, decreased 0.8% during 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was driven by service revenue decline, partially offset by increasing recurring
device payment plan billings.

Equipment Revenue

Equipment revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 7.8%, during 2017 compared to 2016, as a result of an increase in the Verizon device payment program take rate and an increase
in the price of devices, partially offset by an overall decline in device sales.

Other Revenue

Other revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 8.1%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $0.3 billion increase in financing revenues from our device payment program
and a $0.2 billion volume-driven increase in revenues related to our device protection package.

Cost of services increased $0.4 billion, or 4.1%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the network to support
demand, as well as new pricing and a volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers. Partially offsetting these increases
were decreases in costs related to roaming and long distance.

Cost of services decreased $0.1 billion, or 1.6%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreases in costs related to roaming, long distance and cost of data. Partially
offsetting these decreases were higher rent expense as a result of an increase in macro and small cell sites supporting network capacity expansion and densification, as well as a
volume-driven increase in costs related to the device protection package offered to our customers.

Cost of Equipment

Cost of equipment increased $1.2 billion, or 5.3%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily as a result of shifts to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold, partially offset
by declines in the number of smartphones sold.

Cost of equipment decreased  $0.1  billion,  or  0.4%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily  as  a  result  of  a  decline  in  the  number  of  smartphone  and  Internet  units  sold,
substantially offset by a shift to higher priced units in the mix of devices sold.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  decreased  $1.3  billion,  or  7.1%,  during  2018  compared  to  2017,  primarily  due  to  a  $1.2  billion  decline  in  sales  commission
expense, as well as a decline of approximately $0.1 billion in employee related costs, primarily due to lower headcount and a decrease in bad debt expense. The decline in sales
commission  expense  during  2018  compared  to  2017,  was  driven  by  decreased  selling-related  costs  primarily  arising  from  the  deferral  of  commission  costs  following  the
adoption of Topic 606.

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.0 billion, or 5.3%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $0.6 billion decline in sales commission expense
as well as a decline of approximately $0.2 billion in employee related costs primarily due to lower headcount, as well as a decline in bad debt expense, non-income taxes and
advertising expense. The decline in sales commission expense was driven by an increase in the proportion of activations under the Verizon device payment program, which has
a lower commission per unit than activations under traditional fixed-term service plans, as well as an overall decline in activations.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.3 billion, or 3.6%, during 2018 compared to 2017, and increased $0.2 billion, or 2.3%, during 2017 compared to 2016,
primarily driven by an increase in depreciable assets.

The changes in the table above during the periods presented were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses.

Wireline

In 2017, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously, the customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of Mass Markets (which
included Consumer Retail and Small Business subgroups), Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four customer groups within
the  Wireline  segment:  Consumer  Markets,  which  includes  the  customers  previously  included  in  Consumer  Retail;  Enterprise  Solutions,  which  includes  the  large  business
customers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which includes the customers
previously  included  in  Global  Wholesale;  and  Business  Markets,  a  new  customer  group,  which  includes  U.S.-based  small  business  customers  previously  included  in  Mass
Markets and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government customers, and educational institutions previously included in Global Enterprise.

The operating revenues from XO are included in the Wireline segment results beginning in February 2017, following the completion of the acquisition, and are included with
the Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets customer groups.

The  operating  results  and  statistics  for  all  periods  presented  below  exclude  the  results  of  the  Data  Center  Sale  in  2017  and  other  insignificant  transactions  (see  "Operating
Results From Divested Businesses"). The results were adjusted to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief
operating decision maker.

Wireline’s revenues decreased $0.9 billion, or 3.0%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to decreases in traditional voice, network and HSI services as a result of
technology substitution and competition as well as decreases in demand for traditional linear video within our customer groups. The year ended 2018 includes one additional
month of operating revenues from XO compared to the similar period in 2017.

Fios revenues were $11.9 billion, during 2018 compared to $11.7 billion during 2017. During 2018, our Fios Internet subscriber base increased by 3.7% and our Fios Video
subscriber base decreased by 3.6%, compared to 2017, reflecting increased demand in higher broadband speeds and the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-
top offerings.

Service revenues attributable to voice, Fios Video and HSI services declined, during 2018 compared to 2017, related  to  declines of 8.5%, 3.6%  and  19.4%  in  connections,
respectively. The decline in voice connections is primarily a result of competition and technology substitution with wireless, competing voice over Internet Protocol (IP) and
cable telephony service. The decline in video connections continues to result from the shift in traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings. The increase in Fios Internet
connections was driven by the continuing demand for higher speed Internet connectivity which offset the decline in HSI connections.

Consumer Markets

Consumer Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including Fios Internet, Fios Video and HSI services) and local and long distance voice services
to residential subscribers.

2018 Compared to 2017

Consumer Markets revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 1.5%, during 2018 compared to 2017,  due  to  the  continued  decline  of  Fios  Video,  voice  and  HSI  services,  partially
offset by increases in Fios Internet revenues due to subscriber growth and higher value customer mix.

Consumer  Fios  revenues  increased  $0.2 billion, or 1.5%, during 2018  compared  to  2017.  Fios  represented  approximately  88%  of  Consumer  Markets  revenue  during  2018
compared to approximately 85% during 2017.

The  decline  in  voice  service  revenues  was  primarily  due  to  an  8.5%  decline  in  voice  connections  resulting  primarily  from  competition  and  technology  substitution  with
wireless and competing voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cable telephony services. Total voice connections include traditional switched access lines in service, as well as
Fios digital voice connections.

2017 Compared to 2016

Consumer Markets revenues increased 0.2%, during 2017 compared to 2016, due to increases in Fios revenues as a result of subscriber growth for Fios Internet services fueled
by the introduction of gigabit speed data services, as well as higher pay-per-view sales due to marquee events during the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by the continued
decline of voice service and HSI revenues.

Consumer  Fios  revenues  increased  $0.4 billion, or 3.7%, during 2017  compared  to  2016.  Fios  represented  approximately  85%  of  Consumer  Markets  revenue  during  2017
compared to approximately 82% during 2016.

The  decline  in  voice  service  revenues  was  primarily  due  to  an  8.0%  decline  in  voice  connections  resulting  primarily  from  competition  and  technology  substitution  with
wireless  and  competing  VoIP  and  cable  telephony  services.  Total  voice  connections  include  traditional  switched  access  lines  in  service,  as  well  as  Fios  digital  voice
connections.

Enterprise Solutions

Enterprise  Solutions  provides  professional  and  integrated  managed  services,  delivering  solutions  for  large  businesses,  including  multinational  corporations,  and  federal
government customers. Enterprise Solutions offers traditional circuit-based network services, and advanced networking solutions including Private IP, Ethernet, and Software-
Defined Wide Area Network, along with our traditional voice services and advanced workforce productivity and customer contact center solutions. Our Enterprise Solutions
include security services to manage, monitor, and mitigate cyber-attacks.

2018 Compared to 2017

Enterprise Solutions revenues decreased $0.3 billion, or 3.6%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to declines in traditional data and voice communication services
and equipment as a result of competitive price pressures.

2017 Compared to 2016

Enterprise Solutions revenues remained consistent, during 2017 compared to 2016. Increased revenues resulting from the acquisition of XO were fully offset by declines in
traditional data and voice communications services as a result of competitive price pressures.

Partner Solutions

Partner Solutions provides communications services, including data, voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance and other carriers that
use our facilities to provide services to their customers.

2018 Compared to 2017

Partner Solutions revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 4.6%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to declines in core data and traditional voice services, resulting from
the effect of technology substitution and continuing contraction of market rates due to competition. Data declines were partially offset by growth in higher bandwidth services,
including dark fiber transport.

2017 Compared to 2016

Partner  Solutions  revenues  decreased  0.2%,  during  2017  compared  to  2016,  primarily  related  to  declines  in  traditional  voice  revenues  due  to  the  effect  of  technology
substitution, as well as continuing contraction of market rates due to competition, offset by revenues resulting from the acquisition of XO.

Business Markets

Business Markets offers traditional voice and networking products, Fios services, IP Networking, advanced voice solutions, security, and managed IT services to U.S.-based
small and medium businesses, state and local governments, and educational institutions.

2018 Compared to 2017

Business Markets revenues decreased $0.2 billion, or 5.2%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to revenue declines related to the loss of traditional voice services
and HSI connections, as well as customer premise equipment as a result of competitive price pressures.

2017 Compared to 2016

Business Markets revenues increased $0.2 billion, or 6.8%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of XO, partially offset by revenue declines related
to the loss of traditional voice and HSI connections as a result of competitive price pressures.

Cost of services decreased $0.2 billion, or 1.2%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, cost of equipment and access costs, which were
partially offset by increases in content costs associated with continued increases in the cost of programming license fees and other direct costs.

Cost of services decreased $0.4 billion, or 2.3%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the fact that we did not incur incremental costs in 2017 that were incurred in
2016 as a result of the 2016 Work Stoppage, as well as a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs primarily driven by collective bargaining agreements ratified in
June 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in content costs associated with continued programming license fee increases as well as an increase in access
costs as a result of the acquisition of XO.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.1 billion, or 2.0%, during 2018 compared to 2017, due to decreased selling-related costs primarily arising from the
deferral of commission costs following adoption of Topic 606.

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.2 billion, or 3.1%, during 2017 compared to 2016, due to a decline in net pension and postretirement benefit costs,
primarily  driven  by  collective  bargaining  agreements  ratified  in  June  2016  and  the  fact  that  there  were  no  2016  Work  Stoppage  costs  in  2017,  partially  offset  by  an  9.5%
increase in expenses resulting from the acquisition of XO.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.1 billion, or 1.3%, during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increases in net depreciable assets.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.1 billion, or 2.2%, during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in net depreciable assets as a result of the

During 2018, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion, which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7% at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 ($2.6 billion), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of which related to healthcare claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)% ($1.9 billion). The credits were partially offset by $0.2 billion  due  to  the  effects  of  participants  retiring  under  the  voluntary  separation  program.
During  2018,  we  also  recorded  net  pre-tax  severance  charges  of  $2.2 billion  in  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense,  primarily  driven  by  the  voluntary  separation
program for select U.S.-based management employees and other headcount reduction initiatives, which resulted in a severance charge of $1.8 billion ($1.4 billion after-tax),
and $0.3 billion in severance costs recorded under other existing separation plans.

During  2017,  we  recorded  net  pre-tax  severance,  pension  and  benefits  charges  of  $1.4 billion,  exclusive  of  acquisition  related  severance  charges,  in  accordance  with  our
accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion,
which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7% at
December 31, 2017 ($2.6 billion). The charges were partially offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of 14.0%
($1.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.2 billion) and other
assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

During 2016, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $2.9 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses
in the period in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion, which were recorded in Other income (expense), net, in our consolidated
statements of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement
benefit  plans  from  a  weighted-average  of  4.6%  at  December  31,  2015  to  a  weighted-average  of  4.2%  at  December  31,  2016  ($2.1 billion),  updated  health  care  trend  cost
assumptions  ($0.9  billion),  the  difference  between  our  estimated  return  on  assets  of  7.0%  and  our  actual  return  on  assets  of  6.0%  ($0.2  billion)  and  other  assumption
adjustments ($0.3 billion). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued
by  the  Society of Actuaries ($0.5 billion)  and  lower  negotiated  prescription  drug  pricing  ($0.5 billion).  As  part  of  these  charges,  we  also  recorded  severance  costs  of  $0.4
billion under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

The net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion measured as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefits remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion measured as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailments in three  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  and  one  of  our  other  postretirement  plans,  a  net  pre-tax
pension and benefits remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bargained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.1 billion measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.6
billion measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our defined benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax
pension  and  benefits  credit  of  $1.9 billion  as  a  result  of  our  fourth  quarter  remeasurement  of  our  pension  and  other  postretirement  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  updated
actuarial assumptions.

Due to the presentation of the other components of net periodic benefit cost, we recognize a portion of the pension and benefits charges (credits) in Other income (expense),
net, in our consolidated statements of income. The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion (see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the amount of the severance, pension and benefits charges (credits) recorded
in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

Gain on Spectrum License Transactions

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. (T-Mobile USA) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless
Services (AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. As a result of this agreement, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at
fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2017.

During the first quarter of 2017, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a
result of this non-cash exchange, we received $1.0 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion in Selling, general and
administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During the first quarter of 2016, we completed a license exchange transaction with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. As a result of this
non-cash exchange, we received $0.4 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.1 billion in Selling, general
and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the gains on the spectrum license transactions described above.

Acquisition and Integration Related Charges

Acquisition and integration related charges of $0.6 billion and $0.9 billion recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily related to the acquisition of
Yahoo’s operating business in June 2017.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the acquisition and integration related charges described above.

Product Realignment Charges

Product realignment charges of $0.7 billion recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the discontinuation of the go90 platform and associated
content during the second quarter of 2018.

Product realignment charges of $0.7 billion recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to charges taken against certain early-stage developmental
technologies during the fourth quarter of 2017.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the product realignment costs described above.

Oath Goodwill Impairment

The Oath goodwill impairment charge of $4.6 billion recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Media business, branded Oath, was a result of the company's
annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter (see "Critical Accounting Estimates").

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the goodwill impairment charge described above.

Net Gain on Sale of Divested Businesses

The net gain on the sale of divested businesses of $1.8 billion recorded during 2017 related to the Data Center Sale in May 2017 and other insignificant transactions.

The net gain on the sale of divested businesses of $1.0 billion recorded during 2016 related to the Access Line Sale. The gain recorded included a $0.5 billion pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other postretirement benefits for some or all future services of a significant number
of employees covered in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans.

The Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP measure presented in the Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA discussion
(see "Consolidated Results of Operations") excludes the gains on the Data Center Sale and other insignificant transactions and the Access Line Sale described above.

Early Debt Redemption Costs

During 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $0.7 billion, $2.0 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively.

We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information related to our early debt redemptions.

Operating Environment and Trends

The industries that we operate in are highly competitive, which we expect to continue particularly as traditional and non-traditional service providers seek increased market
share.  We  believe  that  our  high-quality  customer  base  and  networks  differentiate  us  from  our  competitors  and  give  us  the  ability  to  plan  and  manage  through  changing
economic  and  competitive  conditions.  We  remain  focused  on  executing  on  the  fundamentals  of  the  business:  maintaining  a  high-quality  customer  base,  delivering  strong
financial and operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continue to invest for growth, which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders.
We continue to lead in 4G LTE performance while building momentum for our 5G network. We believe that our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments
in our Intelligent Edge Network that enable efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements at the edge of the network.

The U.S. wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones, which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry. We expect future
revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and
services  and  increasing  the  penetration  of  other  connected  devices  including  wearables,  tablets  and  IoT  devices.  We  expect  5G  technology  will  provide  a  significant
opportunity for growth in the industry in 2020 and beyond. Current and potential competitors in the U.S. wireless market include other national wireless service providers,
various regional wireless service providers, wireless resellers and cable companies, as well as other communications and technology companies providing wireless products
and services.

Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. We compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we
believe they will regard as the best available value for the price. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering
service plans at competitive prices that include voice services, data access and text messaging, in some cases on an unlimited basis. These service offerings will vary from time
to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances.

Many wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, also offer device payment options, which provide consumers with the ability to pay for their device over
a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher
access plans, as well as from increased connections per account. Future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services
and increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our network and services and the development of new ecosystems.

Current and potential competitors to our Wireline businesses include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite
television companies, Internet service providers, over-the-top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.

In  addition,  companies  with  a  global  presence  increasingly  compete  with  our  wireline  businesses.  A  relatively  small  number  of  telecommunications  and  integrated  service
providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large
contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all
of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth.

Despite  this  challenging  environment,  we  expect  that  we  will  be  able  to  grow  key  aspects  of  our  Wireline  segment  by  providing  network  reliability,  offering  consumers
products, including broadband Internet access, digital television and voice services, offering business and government customers more robust IP products and services, and
accelerating our IoT strategies.

The online advertising market continues to evolve as online users are migrating from traditional desktop to mobile and multiple-device usage. Also, there is a continued shift
towards programmatic advertising which presents opportunities to connect online advertisers with the appropriate online users in a rapid environment. Our Media business
competes with other online search engines, advertising platforms, digital video services and social networks. We are experiencing pressure from search and desktop usage and
believe the pressure in these sectors will continue. We will implement initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and build services around our core content
pillars to diversify revenue and return to growth.

We will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to attempt to offset adverse impacts from unfavorable economic conditions and competitive pressures.

2019 Connection Trends

In  our  Wireless  segment,  we  expect  to  continue  to  attract  and  maintain  the  loyalty  of  high-quality  retail  postpaid  customers,  capitalizing  on  demand  for  data  services  and
bringing  our  customers  new  ways  of  using  wireless  services  in  their  daily  lives.  We  expect  that  future  connection  growth  will  be  driven  by  smartphones,  tablets  and  other
connected devices such as wearables. We believe the overall customer experience of matching the unlimited plan with our high-quality network continues to attract and retain
higher value retail postpaid connections, contributes to continued increases in the penetration of data services and helps us remain competitive with other wireless carriers. We
expect to manage churn by providing a consistent, reliable experience on our wireless network and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing
and better execution in our distribution channels.

In  our  Wireline  segment,  we  have  experienced  continuing  access  line  losses  as  customers  have  disconnected  both  primary  and  secondary  lines  and  switched  to  alternative
technologies such as wireless, VoIP and cable for voice and data services. We expect to continue to experience access line losses as customers continue to switch to alternate
technologies. We expect to continue to grow our Fios Internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our Fios service areas. In Fios video, the business
continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market. We expect to expand our existing business through our Intelligent Edge Network, our
multi-use platform.

2019 Operating Revenue Trends

In our Wireless segment, we expect to see a continuation of the service revenue trends from 2018 as customers shift to higher access plans and increase the number of ways
they connect with our network and services. Equipment revenues are largely dependent on wireless device sales volumes, the mix of devices, promotions and upgrade cycles,
which are subject to device lifecycles, iconic device launches and competition within the wireless industry.

In  our  Wireline  segment,  we  expect  segment  revenue  pressures  as  growth  in  our  high-quality  fiber-based  products  continues  to  be  offset  by  technology  shifts  and  ongoing
secular declines from legacy technologies and competition. We expect Consumer Markets revenue to experience near‑term declines to be driven by legacy core declines and
cord-cutting  only  partially  offset  by  Fios  broadband  growth.  We  expect  a  continued  decline  in  core  revenues  for  our  Business  Markets,  Enterprise  Solutions  and  Partner
Solutions customer offerings; however, we expect revenue growth from advanced business and fiber-based services, including the expansion of our fiber footprint, to partially,
and in some cases fully, mitigate these declines for the customer groups.

Our  Media  business,  Verizon  Media,  which  operated  in  2018  under  the  "Oath"  brand,  is  primarily  made  up  of  digital  advertising  products.  We  are  experiencing  revenue
pressure from search and desktop usage and believe the pressure in those sectors will continue. We are focused on returning to revenue growth by implementing initiatives to
realize synergies across all of our media assets and building services around our core content pillars. We are experiencing positive growth in mobile usage and video products.

2019 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends

We expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall
cost  structure  by  improving  productivity  and  gaining  efficiency  in  our  operations  throughout  the  business  in  2019  and  beyond.  Business  Excellence  initiatives  include  the
adoption  of  the  zero-based  budgeting  methodology,  driving  capital  efficiencies  from  network  restructuring,  evolving  our  Information  Technology  strategy  and  offering  the
voluntary separation program. The goal of the Business Excellence initiative is to take $10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over four years, beginning
with 2018. As part of this initiative, we are focusing on both operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our Business Excellence initiatives have produced cumulative cash
savings  of  $2.3  billion  in  2018  from  a  mix  of  capital  and  operational  expenditure  activities.  The  program  remains  on  track  to  achieve  our  goal.  Expenses  related  to  newly
acquired businesses and programs funded through the reinvestment of program savings are expected to apply offsetting pressures to our margins.

The implementation of Topic 606, resulted in the deferral of commission expense in both our Wireless and Wireline segments. In 2019 and 2020, we expect a smaller benefit
from the adoption of the standard due to the deferral of commissions costs as compared to 2018.

Due to the implementation of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842 related to leasing on January 1, 2019, we estimate the impact to operating expense for the full year
2019 will be an increase due to certain initial direct costs that can no longer be deferred under the new accounting guidance.

We create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby
increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders.
Verizon’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly dividend by 2.1% during 2018, making this the twelfth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend.

Our  goal  is  to  use  our  cash  to  create  long-term  value  for  our  shareholders.  We  will  continue  to  look  for  investment  opportunities  that  will  help  us  to  grow  the  business,
strengthen  our  balance  sheet,  acquire  spectrum  licenses  (see  "Cash  Flows  from  Investing  Activities"),  pay  dividends  to  our  shareholders  and,  when  appropriate,  buy  back
shares of our outstanding common stock (see "Cash Flows from Financing Activities").

Capital Expenditures

Our 2019  capital  program  includes  capital  to  fund  advanced  networks  and  services,  including  expanding  our  core  networks,  adding  capacity  and  density  to  our  4G  LTE
network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying our 5G network, transforming our structure to deploy the Intelligent Edge Network
while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies. We expect that the new network architecture will
simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G technology, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to
homes  and  businesses,  and  create  new  enterprise  opportunities  in  the  business  market.  The  level  and  the  timing  of  the  Company’s  capital  expenditures  within  these  broad
categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside of our control, such as material weather events. Capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be in
the range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion, including the continued investment in our 5G network. Capital expenditures were $16.7 billion in 2018 and $17.2 billion in 2017.
We believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a Company-wide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that
would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events.

We use the net cash generated from our operations to fund network expansion and modernization, service and repay external financing, pay dividends, invest in new businesses
and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from external financing
arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily
through  internally  generated  funds.  Debt  or  equity  financing  may  be  needed  to  fund  additional  investments  or  development  activities  or  to  maintain  an  appropriate  capital
structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally, and are invested to maintain principal and provide
liquidity. See "Market Risk" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.

Our  available  external  financing  arrangements  include  an  active  commercial  paper  program,  credit  available  under  credit  facilities  and  other  bank  lines  of  credit,  vendor
financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other capital market securities that are privately-placed or offered
overseas. In addition, we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.

On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 and ASU 2016-15. As required by ASU 2016-18, we included restricted cash in the statement of cash flows for all periods
presented. In addition, as required by ASU 2016-15, we retrospectively reclassified approximately $0.6 billion of collections of deferred purchase price related to off-balance
sheet securitization from Cash flows from operating activities to Cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December
31, 2017, and $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities

Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 increased by $10.0 billion primarily due to
an improvement in working capital which includes a decrease in cash income taxes, an increase of $4.0 billion in earnings, and a lower amount of discretionary contributions to
qualified employee benefit plans in 2018 compared to 2017. We made $1.7 billion and $3.4 billion in discretionary employee benefits contributions during 2018 and 2017,
respectively, primarily to our defined benefit pension plan. As a result of the discretionary pension contributions in 2018 and a $0.3 billion discretionary contribution in January
2019,  we  expect  that  there  will  be  no  required  pension  funding  until  2024,  which  will  benefit  future  cash  flows.  Further,  the  funded  status  of  our  qualified  pension  plan
improved as a result of the contributions.

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 increased by $2.6 billion primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our
discretionary contributions to qualified pension plans of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device
payment plan receivables, as discussed below.

During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities,  to  asset-backed  debt  transactions  that  are  recorded  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities.  During  2016,  we  received
proceeds  related  to  sales  of  wireless  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  of  approximately  $2.0  billion.  See  Note  8  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion and $5.0 billion,
respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures

Capital  expenditures  continue  to  relate  primarily  to  the  use  of  capital  resources  to  facilitate  the  introduction  of  new  products  and  services,  enhance  responsiveness  to
competitive challenges, maintain the existing infrastructure and increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks.

Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, were as follows:

Capital expenditures decreased at Wireless in 2018 primarily due to capital efficiencies from our business excellence initiatives. Capital expenditures increased at Wireline in
2018,  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  investments  to  support  multi-use  fiber  assets,  which  support  the  densification  of  our  4G  LTE  network  and  a  continued  focus  on  5G
technology deployment. Our investments primarily related to network equipment to support the business. Capital expenditures decreased at Wireless in 2017 primarily due to
the shift in investments to fiber assets. Capital expenditures increased at Wireline in 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in investments to support our multi-use fiber
deployment.

Acquisitions

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we invested $1.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, in acquisitions of wireless licenses. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we also
invested $0.2 billion, $5.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired.

In January 2018, Verizon acquired NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink) from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments,
of which $0.3 billion, an option exercise price to acquire NextLink, was prepaid in the first quarter of 2017. The option exercise price represented the fair value of the option.
The remaining cash consideration was paid at the closing of the transaction. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G technology deployment.

In February  2018, Verizon acquired Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path), a  holder  of  millimeter  wave  spectrum  configured  for 5G  wireless  services  for  total
consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion, which was primarily settled with Verizon shares but also included transaction costs payable in cash
of approximately $0.7 billion, consisting primarily of a fee paid to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being
used for our 5G technology deployment.

In February 2017, Verizon acquired XO, which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5
billion, of which $0.1 billion was paid in 2015.

In June 2017, Verizon acquired Yahoo's operating business for cash consideration of approximately $4.7 billion, including cash acquired of $0.2 billion.

In December 2017, Verizon purchased certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW!) for cash consideration of approximately
$0.2 billion.

In July 2016, we acquired Telogis, Inc. (Telogis), a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.

In November 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics Group PLC (Fleetmatics), a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, for $60.00 per ordinary
share in cash. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we acquired various other businesses and investments for cash consideration that was not significant.

See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our acquisitions.

Dispositions

During 2017, we received net cash proceeds of $3.5 billion in connection with the Data Center Sale on May 1, 2017. We also completed other insignificant transactions during
2017.

During 2016, we received cash proceeds of $9.9 billion in connection with the completion of the Access Line Sale on April 1, 2016.

See "Acquisitions and Divestitures" for additional information on our dispositions.

Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities

We seek to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility
resulting from changes in market conditions. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $15.4 billion, $6.2 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively.

2018

During 2018, our net cash used in financing activities of $15.4 billion was primarily driven by:

•

•

$14.6  billion  used  for  repayments,  redemptions  and  repurchases  of  long-term  borrowings  and  capital  lease  obligations,  which  included  $3.6  billion  used  for
prepayments and repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings; and
$9.8 billion used for dividend payments.

These  uses  of  cash  were  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings  of  $10.8  billion,  which  included  $4.8  billion  of  proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt
transactions.

Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2018, our total debt decreased to $113.1 billion as compared to $117.1 billion at December 31, 2017. Our effective interest rate was 4.8% and 4.7% during the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consists of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest
rates do not have a material effect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

At December 31, 2018, approximately $17.1 billion or 15.1% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Verizon may continue to repurchase debt securities issued by Verizon and its affiliates in the future through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender
offers, exchange offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as Verizon may from time to time determine for cash or other consideration.

Other, net

Other, net financing activities during 2018 included early debt redemption costs, see "Special Items" for additional information, as well as cash paid on debt exchanges and
derivative-related transactions.

Dividends

The Verizon Board of Directors assesses the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis taking into account such factors as long-term growth opportunities, internal
cash  requirements  and  the  expectations  of  our  shareholders.  During  the  third  quarter  of  2018,  the  Board  increased  our  quarterly  dividend  payment  2.1%  to  $0.6025  from
$0.5900 per share in the prior period. This is the twelfth consecutive year that Verizon’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.

As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2018, we paid $9.8 billion in dividends.

2017

During 2017, our net cash used in financing activities of $6.2 billion was primarily driven by:

•

•

$24.2  billion  used  for  repayments,  redemptions  and  repurchases  of  long-term  borrowings  and  capital  lease  obligations,  which  included  $0.4  billion  used  for
prepayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings; and
$9.5 billion used for dividend payments.

These  uses  of  cash  were  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings  of  $32.0  billion,  which  included  $4.3  billion  of  proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt
transactions.

Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2017, our total debt increased to $117.1 billion as compared to $108.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Our effective interest rate was 4.7% and 4.8% during the
years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest
rates did not have a material effect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

At December 31, 2017, approximately $18.0 billion or 15.3% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign

denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market
Risk" for additional information.

Other, net

Other,  net  financing activities during 2017,  included  early  debt  redemption  costs.  See  "Special  Items"  for  additional  information  related  to  the  early  debt  redemption  costs
incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2017, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5900 from $0.5775 per share in the prior period.

As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2017, we paid $9.5 billion in dividends.

2016

During 2016, our net cash used in financing activities of $13.4 billion was primarily driven by:

•
•

$19.2 billion used for repayments, redemptions and repurchases of long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations; and
$9.3 billion used for dividend payments.

These  uses  of  cash  were  partially  offset  by  proceeds  from  long-term  borrowings  of  $18.0  billion,  which  included  $5.0  billion  of  proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt
transactions.

Proceeds from and Repayments, Redemptions, and Repurchases of Long-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2016, our total debt decreased to $108.1 billion as compared to $109.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Our effective interest rate was 4.8% during the year
ended December 31, 2016. The substantial majority of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness, therefore, changes in interest rates did not have a material
effect on our interest payments. See also "Market Risk" for additional information.

At December 31, 2016, approximately $11.6 billion or 10.7% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of foreign denominated debt, primarily the
Euro and British Pound Sterling. We have entered into cross currency swaps on a majority of our foreign denominated debt in order to fix our future interest and principal
payments in U.S. dollars and mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. See "Market Risk" for additional information.

Other, net

Other,  net  financing  activities  during  2016,  included  early  debt  redemption  costs  of  $1.8  billion.  See  "Special  Items"  for  additional  information  related  to  the  early  debt
redemption costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Dividends

During the third quarter of 2016, the Board increased our quarterly dividend payment 2.2% to $0.5775 from $0.565 per share in the prior period.

As in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. During 2016, we paid $9.3 billion in dividends.

Asset-Backed Debt

As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $10.1 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes notes (the Asset-Backed Notes) issued to third-party
investors  (Investors)  and  loans  (ABS  Financing  Facilities)  received  from  banks  and  their  conduit  facilities  (collectively,  the  Banks).  Our  consolidated  asset-backed  debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership (Cellco) and
certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively, the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entities retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.

Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The  Investors  or  Banks,  as  applicable,  which  hold  our  asset-backed  debt  have  legal  recourse  to  the  assets  securing  the  debt,  but  do  not  have  any  recourse  to  Verizon  with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.

Cash  collections  on  the  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  collateralizing  our  asset-backed  debt  securities  are  required  at  certain  specified  times  to  be  placed  into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other, and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.

Proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions  are  reflected  in  Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  in  our  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  The  asset-
backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.

During September 2016 and May 2017, we entered into loan agreements through an ABS Entity with a number of financial institutions. Under these ABS loan agreements, we
have  the  right  to  prepay  all  or  a  portion  of  the  loans  at  any  time  without  penalty,  but  in  certain  cases,  with  breakage  costs.  The  two  year  revolving  period  of  the  two  loan
agreements ended in September 2018. In 2018, we made a $1.5 billion drawdown and an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion of prepayments and repayments. We made a $0.4
billion prepayment in December 2017.

In May 2018, we entered into a second device payment plan agreement financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). Under the
terms of the 2018 ABS Financing Facility, the financial institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of business
customers for proceeds of $0.5 billion.

Credit Facilities

In April 2018, we amended our $9.0 billion credit facility to increase the capacity to $9.5 billion and extend its maturity to April 4, 2022. As of December 31, 2018, the unused
borrowing capacity under our $9.5 billion credit facility was approximately $9.4 billion. The credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit
and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2016, we entered into a $1.0 billion credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden, the Swedish export credit agency. As of December 31,
2018, the outstanding balance was $0.7 billion. We used this credit facility to finance network equipment-related purchases.

In July 2017, we entered into credit facilities insured by various export credit agencies providing us with the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion to finance equipment-related
purchases. The facilities have borrowings available, portions of which extend through October 2019, contingent upon the amount of eligible equipment-related purchases that
we make. During 2018, we drew down $3.0 billion from these facilities, and $2.8 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we drew down an
additional $0.4 billion from these facilities.

Common Stock

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017 and 2016, we issued 3.5 million, 2.8 million and 3.5 million common shares from Treasury stock, respectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value.

In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner. The program permits
Verizon  to  repurchase  shares  over  time,  with  the  amount  and  timing  of  repurchases  depending  on  market  conditions  and  corporate  needs.  There  were  no  repurchases  of
common stock during 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Credit Ratings

Verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Securities  ratings  assigned  by  rating  organizations  are  expressions  of  opinion  and  are  not  recommendations  to  buy,  sell  or  hold  securities.  A  securities  rating  is  subject  to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Covenants

Our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely
fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial
transactions,  maintain  our  properties,  provide  financial  and  other  reports  to  our  lenders,  limit  pledging  and  disposition  of  assets  and  mergers  and  consolidations,  and  other
similar covenants.

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Change In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 totaled $2.7 billion, a $0.7 billion increase compared to Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 primarily as a
result of the factors discussed above. Our Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 totaled $2.1 billion, a $0.8 billion decrease compared to Cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.

Restricted cash at December 31, 2018 totaled $1.2 billion, a $0.4 billion increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2017 primarily due to cash collections on the
device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts. Restricted cash at December 31, 2017 totaled $0.8
billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to restricted cash at December 31, 2016 primarily related to cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables that
are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete
understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. We
believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it
does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations
or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free cash flow:

The  changes  in  free  cash  flow  during  2018, 2017 and 2016  were  a  result  of  the  factors  described  in  connection  with  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  and  capital
expenditures. The change in free cash flow during 2018 was primarily due to an improvement in working capital which includes a decrease in cash income taxes, an increase of
$4.0  billion  in  earnings,  and  a  lower  amount  of  discretionary  contributions  to  qualified  employee  benefit  plans  in  2018  compared  to  2017.  We  made  $1.7  billion  and  $3.4
billion  in  discretionary  employee  benefits  contributions  during  2018  and  2017,  respectively,  primarily  to  our  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  As  a  result  of  the  discretionary
pension contributions in 2018 and a $0.3 billion discretionary contribution in January 2019, we expect that there will be no required pension funding until 2024, which will
benefit  future  cash  flows.  Further,  the  funded  status  of  our  qualified  pension  plan  improved  as  a  result  of  the  contributions.  Capital  expenditures  decreased  during  2018
compared to 2017, primarily due to capital expenditure efficiencies from our Business Excellence initiatives.

The change in free cash flow during 2017 was primarily due to an increase in earnings and changes in working capital, partially offset by our discretionary contributions to
qualified pension plans of $3.4 billion (approximately $2.1 billion, net of tax benefit) and the change in the method in which we monetize device payment plan receivables, as
discussed below.

During 2016, we changed the strategic method by which we monetize device payment plan receivables from sales of device payment plan receivables, which were recorded
within  cash  flows  provided  by  operating  activities,  to  asset-backed  debt  transactions  that  are  recorded  in  cash  flows  from  financing  activities.  During  2016,  we  received
proceeds  related  to  sales  of  wireless  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  of  approximately  $2.0  billion.  See  Note  8  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received proceeds from asset-backed debt transactions of approximately $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion and $5.0 billion,
respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and "Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities" for additional information.

Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions

Employer Contributions

We  operate  numerous  qualified  and  nonqualified  pension  plans  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans.  These  plans  primarily  relate  to  our  domestic  business  units.  During
2018, 2017 and 2016, contributions to our qualified pension plans were $1.0 billion, $4.0 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. We made no contribution to our nonqualified
pension plans in 2018, and contributed $0.1 billion in both 2017 and 2016. In January 2019, we made a $0.3 billion discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans.

The company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. In an
effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match cash flows
from investments with projected benefit payments. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase (referred to
as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however, we also expect the strategy to result in lower
asset returns. Nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately $0.1 billion in 2019.

Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an as-incurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not
have funding requirements similar to the pension plans. We contributed $0.7 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. Contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion in 2019.

(1) Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2) See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3) Items included in purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the
subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. For this reason, the amounts presented in this table alone do
not  provide  a  reliable  indicator  of  our  expected  future  cash  outflows  or  changes  in  our  expected  cash  position.  See  Note 16  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for
additional information.

(4) Other  long-term  liabilities  represent  estimated  postretirement  benefit  and  qualified  pension  plan  contributions.  Estimated  qualified  pension  plan  contributions  include
expected minimum funding contributions, which commence in 2024 based on the plan's current funded status. Estimated postretirement benefit payments include expected
future  postretirement  benefit  payments.  These  estimated  amounts:  (1)  are  subject  to  change  based  on  changes  to  assumptions  and  future  plan  performance,  which  could
impact the timing or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts. See Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.

(5) Represents  future  minimum  payments  under  the  sublease  arrangement  for  our  tower  transaction.  See  Note  6  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional

information.

We are not able to make a reasonable estimate of when the unrecognized tax benefits balance of $2.9 billion and related interest and penalties will be settled with the respective
taxing authorities until issues or examinations are further developed. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Guarantees

We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries as well as the debt obligations of GTE LLC, as successor in interest to GTE Corporation, that
were issued and outstanding prior to July 1, 2003. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As  a  result  of  the  closing  of  the  Access  Line  Sale  on  April  1,  2016,  GTE  Southwest  Inc.,  Verizon  California  Inc.  and  Verizon  Florida  LLC  are  no  longer  wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Verizon, and the guarantees of $0.6 billion aggregate principal amount of debentures and first mortgage bonds of those entities have terminated pursuant to their
terms.

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sale  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides  representations  and  warranties  to  the  purchasers
pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as financial losses. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

As  of  December  31,  2018,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $0.6  billion,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  support  several  financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of
derivatives  including  cross  currency  swaps,  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps,  interest  rate  swaps,  interest  rate  caps  and  foreign  exchange  forwards.  We  do  not  hold
derivatives for trading purposes.

It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing
exposure to various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to
protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely
eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings.

Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. During 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend amendments to certain of our
collateral exchange arrangements, which eliminated the requirement to post collateral for a specified period of time. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we began
negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreements and CSA agreements with our counterparties. The negotiations and executions of new agreements continued in 2018.
The  newly  executed  CSA  agreements  contain  rating  based  thresholds  such  that  we  or  our  counterparties  may  be  required  to  hold  or  post  collateral  based  upon  changes  in
outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2018, we posted collateral of approximately $0.1 billion related to
derivative  contracts  under  collateral  exchange  arrangements,  which  were  recorded  as  Prepaid  expenses  and  other  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  We  did  not  post  any
collateral at December 31, 2017. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that
any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties. See Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2018,
approximately  78%  of  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  our  total  debt  portfolio  consisted  of  fixed  rate  indebtedness,  including  the  effect  of  interest  rate  swap  agreements
designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our
interest  rate  swap  agreements  that  are  designated  as  hedges,  of  approximately  $0.3  billion.  The  interest  rates  on  our  existing  long-term  debt  obligations  are  unaffected  by
changes to our credit ratings.

The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The
table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve.
Our  sensitivity  analysis  does  not  include  the  fair  values  of  our  commercial  paper  and  bank  loans,  if  any,  because  they  are  not  significantly  affected  by  changes  in  market
interest rates.

We  enter  into  interest  rate  swaps  to  achieve  a  targeted  mix  of  fixed  and  variable  rate  debt.  We  principally  receive  fixed  rates  and  pay  variable  rates  based  on  the London
Interbank Offered Rate, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure
of  designated  debt  issuances.  At  December  31,  2018,  the  fair  value  of  the  asset  and  liability  of  these  contracts  was  insignificant  and  $0.8  billion,  respectively.  At
December 31, 2017, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts were $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional
amount of the interest rate swaps was $19.8 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively.

Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps

We  have  entered  into  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  in  order  to  manage  our  exposure  to  interest  rate  changes  on  future  forecasted
transactions. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $0.1 billion. At December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the forward starting
interest rate swaps was $4.0 billion.

Interest Rate Caps

We also have interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate
our  interest  exposure  to  interest  rate  increases  on  our  ABS  Financing  Facility  and  Asset-Backed  Notes.  The  fair  value  of  the  asset  and  liability  of  these  contracts  were
insignificant at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional value of these contracts was $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into
U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2018, our primary translation
exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen.

Cross Currency Swaps

We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar-denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The fair value of the asset
of  these  contracts  was  $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion at December 31, 2018  and  2017,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2018  and  2017,  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  of  these
contracts was $0.5 billion and insignificant respectively. At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $16.6 billion.

Foreign Exchange Forwards

We  also  have  foreign  exchange  forwards  which  we  use  as  an  economic  hedge  but  for  which  we  have  elected  not  to  apply  hedge  accounting.  We  enter  into  British
Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of
international subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $0.6 billion.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Critical Accounting Estimates

A summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows:

• Wireless  licenses  and  Goodwill  are  a  significant  component  of  our  consolidated  assets.  Both  our  wireless  licenses  and  goodwill  are  treated  as  indefinite-lived  intangible
assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or
changes  in  circumstances  during  an  interim  period  providing  impairment  indicators  are  present.  We  believe  our  estimates  and  assumptions  are  reasonable  and  represent
appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair
value  calculations  used  in  our  impairment  tests,  these  estimates  and  assumptions  are  uncertain  by  nature,  may  change  over  time  and  can  vary  from  actual  results.  It  is
possible  that  in  the  future  there  may  be  changes  in  our  estimates  and  assumptions,  including  the  timing  and  amount  of  future  cash  flows,  margins,  growth  rates,  market
participant  assumptions,  comparable  benchmark  companies  and  related  multiples  and  discount  rates,  which  could  result  in  different  fair  value  estimates.  Significant  and
adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.

Wireless Licenses

The carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $94.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting,
as  we  utilize  our  wireless  licenses  on  an  integrated  basis  as  part  of  our  nationwide  wireless  network.  Our  wireless  licenses  provide  us  with  the  exclusive  right  to  utilize
certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. There are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses.

In 2018, our quantitative impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test
date.

In 2017 and 2016, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than
the  carrying  amount.  As  part  of  our  assessment  we  considered  several  qualitative  factors  including  the  business  enterprise  value  of  Wireless,  macroeconomic  conditions
(including  changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market  considerations  (including  industry  revenue  and  EBITDA  margin  projections),  the  projected
financial performance of Wireless, as well as other factors.

Our impairment tests in 2018, 2017 and 2016 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses significantly exceeded their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in
an impairment.

Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation
approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except
the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated
wireless  licenses  as  of  the  valuation  date.  As  a  result,  we  were  required  to  make  significant  estimates  about  future  cash  flows  specifically  associated  with  our  wireless
licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows and assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and
expected future economic conditions, current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related

equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of
capital (WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. We developed the discount rate based on our consideration
of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date. Accordingly, our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a
marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the
valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate.

Goodwill

At December 31, 2018, the balance of our goodwill was approximately $24.6 billion,  of  which  $18.4 billion  was  in  our  Wireless  reporting  unit,  $3.9 billion  was  in  our
Wireline reporting unit, $0.2 billion was in our Media reporting unit and $2.1 billion was in our Connect reporting unit. To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we
have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we
elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  or  if  indications  of  a  potential  impairment  exist,  the  determination  of  whether  an  impairment  has  occurred  requires  the
determination of the fair value of each respective reporting unit.

We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in 2018 and for all of our reporting units, except for our Wireless reporting unit, in 2017
and 2016 for which a qualitative assessment was completed. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, our impairment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our Wireless, Wireline
and Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. For details on our Media reporting unit, refer to the
discussion below.

Under  our  quantitative  assessment,  the  fair  value  of  the  reporting  unit  is  calculated  using  a  market  approach  and  a  discounted  cash  flow  method.  The  market  approach
includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-
projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the
discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present
value  of  the  terminal  value.  The  discount  rate  represented  our  estimate  of  the  WACC,  or  expected  return,  that  a  marketplace  participant  would  have  required  as  of  the
valuation date. The application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in
assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA growth relative
to  history  and  market  trends  and  expectations.  The  market  multiples  approach  incorporated  significant  judgment  involved  in  the  selection  comparable  public  company
multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. Similar
assumptions were made by management for all of our reporting units. These valuation inputs are inherently uncertain, and an adverse change in one or a combination of
these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future.

The fair value of our Wireless and Connect reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying value for the impairment tests performed for 2018, 2017 and
2016.

Our Wireline reporting unit has experienced increasing market pressures that have resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings and these pressures may persist
over the near term. A projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in
impairment charges in the future. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) further anticipated decreases in service pricing, sales volumes and long-term
growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives. Also, adverse changes
to macroeconomic factors, such as increases to long-term interest rates, would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit.

At the goodwill impairment measurement date of October 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Wireline reporting unit had fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 5%, 14%
and 20%, respectively. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As a result of our goodwill assessment, management believes there is
an increasing risk that our Wireline reporting unit may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future.

Our Media business, which operated under the "Oath" brand during 2018 and is now referred to as Verizon Media, experienced increased competitive and market pressures
throughout 2018 that resulted in lower than expected revenues and earnings. These pressures are expected to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our
competitors in the digital advertising business. Oath also achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Yahoo Inc. and AOL Inc. (AOL) businesses.

As of August 2018, Hans Vestberg became Chief Executive Officer of Verizon, and as of October 2018, K. Guru Gowrappan was appointed Chief Executive Officer of our
Media business. In connection with Verizon’s annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2018, the new leadership at both Oath and Verizon completed a comprehensive
five-year strategic planning review of Oath’s business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Oath’s financial projections. These revised projections were used as
a key input into Oath's annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter.

Consistent  with  our  accounting  policy,  we  applied  a  combination  of  a  market  approach  and  a  discounted  cash  flow  method  reflecting  current  assumptions  and  inputs,
including  our  revised  projections,  discount  rate  and  expected  growth  rates,  which  resulted  determination  that  the  fair  value  of  the  Media  reporting  unit  was  less  than  its
carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our
consolidated statement of income. The goodwill balance

of the Media reporting unit was approximately $4.8 billion prior to the incurrence of this impairment charge. For 2017 and 2016, our impairment test indicated that the fair
value of our Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

• We  maintain  benefit  plans  for  most  of  our  employees,  including,  for  certain  employees,  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  plans.  At  December  31,  2018,  in  the
aggregate, pension plan benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets, which will result in future pension plan expense. Other postretirement benefit
plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets, resulting in expense. Significant benefit plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income, expense, assets
and obligations. Changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits. A sensitivity analysis
of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense (income) recorded, as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in
the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of December 31, 2018 and for the year then ended pertaining to Verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, is
provided in the table below.

*  In  determining  its  pension  and  other  postretirement  obligation,  the  Company  used  a  weighted-average  discount  rate  of  4.4%.  The  rate  was  selected  to  approximate  the
composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2018. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion
par outstanding).

The annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the full yield curve approach to
estimate  the  interest  cost  component  of  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits.  We  accounted  for  this  change  as  a  change  in  accounting
estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. Prior to this change, we estimated the interest cost component utilizing a
single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.

The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred
high-quality  fixed  income  corporate  bonds  available  at  the  measurement  date.  These  individual  spot  rates  align  with  the  timing  of  each  future  cash  outflow  for  benefit
payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.

Income Taxes

• Our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in
connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global
commercial  enterprise,  our  income  tax  rate  and  the  classification  of  income  taxes  can  be  affected  by  many  factors,  including  estimates  of  the  timing  and  realization  of
deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance
with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or
expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We  review  and  adjust  our  liability  for  unrecognized  tax  benefits  based  on  our  best  judgment  given  the  facts,  circumstances  and
information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact
income  tax  expense  and  actual  tax  payments.  We  recognize  any  interest  and  penalties  accrued  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  income  tax  expense.  Actual  tax
payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Property, Plant and Equipment

• Our Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record Property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate
Property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. We expect that a one-year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property,
plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2018 depreciation expense of $2.9 billion and that a one-year decrease would result in an increase of approximately
$4.9 billion in our 2018 depreciation expense.

Accounts Receivable

• We maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated losses resulting from
the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially recorded at
fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However, loan balances are assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is recorded if
the loan is considered impaired. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts
and  includes  consideration  of  the  credit  worthiness  and  financial  condition  of  those  customers.  We  record  an  allowance  to  reduce  the  receivables  to  the  amount  that  is
reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the
general economic environment and the aging of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense
based  on  an  estimate  of  the  percentage  of  equipment  revenue  that  will  not  be  collected.  This  estimate  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors  including  historical  write-off
experience, credit quality of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions. If there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if
future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect
earnings in the period the adjustments are made.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standard updates not yet adopted as of December 31, 2018.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Wireless

Spectrum License Transactions

From time to time, we enter into agreements to buy, sell or exchange spectrum licenses. We believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance
the reliability of our network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding
our spectrum license transactions.

Straight Path

In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path, a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for 5G wireless services, for total consideration
reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders $184.00 per share,
payable in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately $0.7 billion, consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the FCC. The transaction
closed in February 2018 at which time we issued approximately 49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately $2.4 billion, and paid the associated cash
consideration. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Wireline

Access Line Sale

In February 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and related landline activities in California,
Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these
three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of
indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers in
California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information.

XO Holdings

In  February  2016,  we  entered  into  a  purchase  agreement  to  acquire XO,  which  owned  and  operated  one  of  the  largest  fiber-based  IP  and  Ethernet  networks  in  the  U.S.
Concurrently,  we  entered  into  a  separate  agreement  to  utilize  certain  wireless  spectrum  from  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  XO  Holdings, NextLink, that  held  its  wireless
spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration
of approximately $1.5 billion, of which $0.1 billion was paid in 2015, and we prepaid $0.3 billion in connection with the NextLink option which represented the fair value of
the option.

In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments, of which $0.3 billion was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Data Center Sale

In  December  2016,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement,  which  was  subsequently  amended  in  March  2017,  with  Equinix  Inc.  pursuant  to  which  we  agreed  to  sell  23
customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction closed in May 2017.

WideOpenWest, Inc.

In  August  2017,  we  entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  to  purchase  certain  fiber-optic  network  assets  in  the  Chicago  market  from  WOW!,  a  leading  provider  of
communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! will complete the
build-out of the network assets in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately $0.3 billion, of which $0.2 billion was received in December 2017.

Other

Acquisition of AOL Inc.

In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approval to settle this matter for total cash consideration of $0.2 billion, of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant gain.
We paid the cash consideration in October 2018.

Acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.’s Operating Business

In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’s operating business for approximately $4.83 billion in  cash,
subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction).

In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million to
approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo  (and  the  losses  arising  therefrom)  were  to  be  disregarded:  (1)  for  purposes  of  specified  conditions  to  Verizon’s  obligations  to  close  the  Transaction;  and  (2)  in
determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Effect" under the Purchase Agreement had occurred.

In June 2017, we completed the Transaction. The aggregate purchase consideration at the closing of the Transaction was approximately $4.7 billion, including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion.

Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains 50% of certain post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time,  Yahoo  disclosed  that  more  than  one  billion  of  the  approximately  three  billion  accounts  existing  in  2013  had  likely  been  affected.  In  accordance  with  the  original
Transaction  agreements,  Yahoo  will  continue  to  retain 100% of  any  liabilities  arising  out  of  any  shareholder  lawsuits  (including  derivative  claims)  and  investigations  and
actions by the SEC.

Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transaction. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments,  certain  undeveloped  land  recently  divested  by  Yahoo,  certain  non-core  intellectual  property  or  its  cash,  other  than  the  cash  from  its  operating  business  we
acquired.  We  received  for  our  benefit  and  that  of  our  current  and  certain  future  affiliates  a  non-exclusive,  worldwide,  perpetual,  royalty-free  license  to  all  of  Yahoo’s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.

In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Yahoo affected all of its accounts.

Fleetmatics Group PLC

In July 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fleetmatics. Fleetmatics was a leading global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to
the terms of the agreement, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash
acquired of $0.1 billion. We completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016.

Other

In July 2016, we acquired Telogis, a global cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $0.9 billion of cash consideration.

From time to time, we enter into strategic agreements to acquire various other businesses and investments. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (Verizon) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in
Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (2013  framework)  (the  COSO  criteria).  In  our
opinion, Verizon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.

We  also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of
Verizon as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and our report dated February 15, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

Verizon’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company’s  assets  that  could  have  a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries

Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications,
information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video
services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, network connectivity, security and control. We have two reportable segments,
Wireless and Wireline. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our business segments.

The  Wireless  segment  provides  wireless  communications  products  and  services,  including  wireless  voice  and  data  services  and  equipment  sales,  across  the  United  States
(U.S.). We provide these services and equipment sales to consumer, business and government customers across the U.S. on a postpaid and prepaid basis.

The Wireline  segment  provides  communications  products  and  enhanced  services,  including  video  and  data  services,  corporate  networking  solutions,  security  and  managed
network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and government
customers both in the U.S. and around the world.

In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. We continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.

Consolidation

The method of accounting applied to investments, whether consolidated, or equity, involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or
suggest  evidence  of  control  or  influence  over  the  operations  of  the  investee.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  our  controlled  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  variable
interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. For controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in
Net income and Total equity. Investments in businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are
accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of Presentation

We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Examples of significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, the recoverability of intangible assets and
other long-lived assets, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits,
valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in connection with business combinations.

Revenue Recognition

We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. We
account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), which we adopted on January 1, 2018,
using the modified retrospective approach. This standard update, along with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a
common revenue standard U.S. GAAP. The standard update also amends current guidance for the recognition of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that
incremental costs of obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers will be deferred and amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service.

We  also  earn  revenues  that  are  not  accounted  for  under  Topic 606 from  leasing  arrangements  (such  as  those  for  towers  and  equipment),  captive  reinsurance  arrangements
primarily  related  to  wireless  device  insurance  and  the  interest  on  equipment  financed  under  a  device  payment  plan  agreement  when  sold  to  the  customer  by  an  authorized
agent.

Wireless

Our  Wireless  segment  earns  revenue  primarily  by  providing  access  to  and  usage  of  our  telecommunications  network  and  selling  equipment.  Performance  obligations  in  a
typical contract, as determined in accordance with Topic 606, with a customer include service and equipment.

Service

We  offer  our  wireless  services  through  a  variety  of  plans  on  a  postpaid  or  prepaid  basis.  For  wireless  service,  we  recognize  revenue  using  an  output  method,  either  as  the
service  allowance  units  are  used  or  as  time  elapses,  because  it  reflects  the  pattern  by  which  we  satisfy  our  performance  obligation  through  the  transfer  of  service  to  the
customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans where monthly usage
exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises
the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).

Wireless Equipment

We sell wireless devices and accessories. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control
passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device,
in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans.

Under a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed-term service contract
(typically for a term of 24 months or less).

Under a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a
24-month  term,  and  concurrently  enters  into  a  month-to-month  contract  for  wireless  service.  We  may  offer  certain  promotions  that  provide  billing  credits  applied  over  a
specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on
their relative selling price, and are recognized when earned.

A financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term,
differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract
level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to
our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the
marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined
that the financing component in our existing Wireless direct channel device payments and fixed-term contracts with customers is not significant and therefore is not accounted
for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized
agent in our indirect channel.

Wireless Contracts

Total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is allocated between service and equipment revenue based on their
estimated  standalone  selling  prices.  We  estimate  the  standalone  selling  price  of  the  device  or  accessory  to  be  its  retail  price  excluding  subsidies  or  conditional  purchase
discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price of wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time
without penalty (i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we also assess
whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as penalties that a customer would have to pay to
early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month wireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights
and obligations involves judgment and impacts our determination of the transaction price and related disclosures.

From time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device payment plans with the right to upgrade to a new device after paying a specified
portion of their device payment plan agreement amount and trading in their device in good working order. We account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation. The full
amount of the trade-in right's fair value is recognized as a guarantee liability and results in a reduction to the revenue recognized upon the sale of the device. The guarantee
obligation was insignificant at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The total transaction price is reduced by the guarantee obligation, which is accounted for outside the scope of
Topic 606, and the remaining transaction price is allocated between the performance obligations within the contract.

Our fixed-term plans generally include the sale of a wireless device at subsidized prices. This results in the creation of a contract asset at the time of sale, which represents the
recognition of equipment revenue in excess of amounts billed.

For our device payment plans, billing credits are accounted for as consideration payable to a customer and are included in the determination of total transaction price, resulting
in a contract liability.

We may provide a right of return on our products and services for a short time period after a sale. These rights are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the
transaction  price,  and  accordingly  we  recognize  revenue  based  on  the  estimated  amount  to  which  we  expect  to  be  entitled  after  considering  expected  returns.  Returns  and
credits  are  estimated  at  contract  inception  and  updated  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  as  additional  information  becomes  available.  We  also  may  provide  credits  or
incentives on our products and services for contracts with resellers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
These amounts have not been significant.

For  certain  bundled  offerings/transactions  involving  third-party  service  providers,  we  evaluate  gross  versus  net  considerations  by  assessing  indicators  of  control.  These
offerings have not been significant.

Wireline

Our Wireline segment earns revenue primarily by providing our customers with services involving access to our telecommunications network and facilities. These services
include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our consumer and business customers and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their
customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprises and government customers. We offer these services to customers that we categorize
in the following customer groups: Consumer Markets, Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets.

Service

For Wireline service, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the
service  is  rendered,  as  the  customer  simultaneously  receives  and  consumes  the  benefits  of  the  services  through  network  access  and  usage.  While  substantially  all  of  our
Wireline service revenues are the result of providing access to our network, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally
billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.

For  communication  and  connectivity  services  provided  to  our  residential  customers,  which  are  sold  to  these  customers  on  a  standalone  basis  or  as  part  of  a  bundle,  we
recognize service revenue over time since control over these services passes to the customer as the service is rendered. Service revenue is recognized ratably each month.

Wireline Contracts

Total consideration, for services that are bundled in a single contract, is allocated to each performance obligation based on our standalone selling price for each service. While
many contracts include one or more service performance obligations, the revenue recognition pattern is generally not impacted by the allocation since the services are generally
satisfied  over  the  same  period  of  time.  We  estimate  the  standalone  selling  price  to  be  the  price  of  the  services  when  sold  on  a  standalone  basis  without  any  promotional
discount. In addition, we also assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers such as penalties
that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts
our determination of transaction price and related disclosures.

We  may  provide  performance-based  credits  or  incentives  on  our  products  and  services  for  contracts  with  our  Enterprise  Solutions,  Partner  Solutions  and  some  Business
Markets customers, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the transaction price. Credits are estimated at contract inception and are updated at the
end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

For  certain  bundled  offerings/transactions  involving  third-party  service  providers,  we  evaluate  gross  versus  net  considerations  by  assessing  indicators  of  control.  These
offerings have not been significant.

Other

Advertising revenues are generated through display advertising and search advertising. Display advertising revenue is generated by the display of graphical advertisements and
other  performance-based  advertising.  Search  advertising  revenue  is  generated  when  a  consumer  clicks  on  a  text-based  advertisement  on  their  screen.  Our  Media  business,
Verizon Media, which operated in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, primarily earns revenue through display advertising on Verizon Media properties, as well as on third-party
properties through our advertising platforms, search advertising and subscription arrangements. We recognize revenue at a point in time for our display and search advertising
contracts and over time for our subscription contracts. We determined that we are generally the principal in transactions carried out through our advertising platforms, and
therefore report gross revenue based on the amount billed to our customers. Where we are the principal, we concluded that while the control and transfer of digital advertising
inventory occurs in a rapid, real-time environment, our proprietary technology enables us to identify, enhance, verify and solely control digital advertising inventory that we
then  sell  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  further  supported  by  us  being  primarily  responsible  to  our  customers  for  fulfillment  and  the  fact  that  we  can  exercise  a  level  of
discretion over pricing.

Verizon Connect primarily earns revenue through subscription services. We recognize revenue over time for our subscription contracts.

We report taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions on a net basis.

Maintenance and Repairs

We charge the cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor items not constituting substantial betterments, principally to Cost of services as these costs
are incurred.

Advertising Costs

Costs for advertising products and services, as well as other promotional and sponsorship costs, are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the periods in
which they are incurred. See Note 15 for additional information.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Where appropriate, diluted earnings per common share
include the dilutive effect of shares issuable under our stock-based compensation plans.

There were a total of approximately 4 million, 5 million and 6 million outstanding dilutive securities, primarily consisting of restricted stock units, included in the computation
of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

We  consider  all  highly  liquid  investments  with  an  original  maturity  of  90  days  or  less  when  purchased  to  be  cash  equivalents.  Cash  equivalents  are  stated  at  cost,  which
approximates quoted market value and includes amounts held in money market funds.

Cash  collections  on  the  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  collateralizing  asset-backed  debt  securities  are  required  at  certain  specified  times  to  be  placed  into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in the following line items on the consolidated balance sheets:

At December 31,

Investments in equity securities that are not accounted for under equity method accounting or result in consolidation are to be measured at fair value. For investments in equity
securities  without  readily  determinable  fair  values,  Verizon  elects  the  measurement  alternative  permitted  under  GAAP  to  measure  these  investments  at  cost,  less  any
impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in
debt securities without quoted prices, Verizon uses an alternative matrix pricing method. Investments in equity securities that do not result in consolidation of the investee are
included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses and debt securities are included in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of an allowance for credit losses, with the exception of indirect-channel device payment
plan  loans.  We  maintain  allowances  for  uncollectible  accounts  receivable,  including  our  direct-channel  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables,  for  estimated  losses
resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment loans are considered financial instruments and are initially
recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses are recorded as incurred. However, loan balances are assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance is
recorded if the loan is considered impaired. Our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer
accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. We record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is
reasonably believed to be collectible. We also record an allowance for all other receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general
economic environment and the aging of such receivables. Similar to traditional service revenue, we record direct device payment plan agreement bad debt expense based on an
estimate of the percentage of equipment revenue that will not be collected. This estimate is based on a number of factors including historical write-off experience, credit quality
of the customer base and other factors such as macroeconomic conditions. We monitor the aging of our accounts with device payment plan agreement receivables and write-off
account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and future collection is unlikely.

Inventories

Inventory consists of wireless and wireline equipment held for sale, which is carried at the lower of cost (determined principally on either an average cost or first-in, first-out
basis) or net realizable value.

Plant and Depreciation

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the remaining term of the related lease, calculated from the time the asset
was placed in service.

When depreciable assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are deducted from the property, plant and equipment accounts and
any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in income.

We capitalize and depreciate network software purchased or developed along with related property, plant and equipment assets. We also capitalize interest associated with the
acquisition or construction of network-related assets. Capitalized interest is reported as a reduction in interest expense and depreciated as part of the cost of the network-related
assets.

In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2018, we determined that the average useful lives of certain assets
would  be  increased.  These  changes  in  estimates  were  applied  prospectively  and  resulted  in  a  decrease  to  depreciation  expense  of  $0.3 billion  for  the  year  ended  2018. In
addition, during 2016 we determined that the average useful lives of certain leasehold improvements would be increased from 5 to 7 years. This change resulted in decreases to
depreciation expense of $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in 2018, 2017  and  2016,  respectively.  We  determined  that  changes  were  also  necessary  to  the  remaining
estimated useful lives of certain assets as a result of technology changes, enhancements and planned retirements. These changes resulted in increases in depreciation expense of
$0.5 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While the timing and extent of current deployment plans are subject to ongoing analysis and
modification, we believe that the current estimates of useful lives are reasonable.

Computer Software Costs

We  capitalize  the  cost  of  internal-use  network  and  non-network  software  that  has  a  useful  life  in  excess  of  one  year.  Subsequent  additions,  modifications  or  upgrades  to
internal-use  network  and  non-network  software  are  capitalized  only  to  the  extent  that  they  allow  the  software  to  perform  a  task  it  previously  did  not  perform.  Planning,
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Also, we capitalize interest associated with the development of internal-use
network  and  non-network  software.  Capitalized  non-network  internal-use  software  costs  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  a  period  of  3 to 7  years  and  are
included in Other intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of our impairment policy for capitalized software costs, see "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" below. Also, see Note 4 for additional information of internal-use non-network software reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually in
the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.

To  determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, we  have  the  option  to  perform  a  qualitative  assessment.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  and
perform an impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level and
compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method) to its carrying value. Estimated fair
values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see Fair Value Measurements discussion below for additional information.

Under the qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the
excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations
(including industry revenue and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin projections), the recent and projected financial performance
of the reporting unit, as well as other factors.

The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based
on the present value of two components, a projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting
unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from
the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a
marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value
over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company updated its five-year strategic planning review for
each  of  its  reporting  units.  Those  plans  considered  current  economic  conditions  and  trends,  estimated  future  operating  results,  the  Company’s  view  of  growth-rates  and-
anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.

See Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.

Intangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization

A significant portion of our intangible assets are wireless licenses that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum to
provide  wireless  communication  services.  While  licenses  are  issued  for  only  a  fixed  time,  generally  ten  years,  such  licenses  are  subject  to  renewal  by  the  Federal
Communications  Commission  (FCC).  License  renewals  have  occurred  routinely  and  at  nominal  cost.  Moreover,  we  have  determined  that  there  are  currently  no  legal,
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, we treat the wireless licenses as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. We re-evaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite
useful life. We aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless
network.

We  test  our  wireless  licenses  for  potential  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  impairment  indicators  are  present.  We  have  the  option  to  first  perform  a  qualitative
assessment  to  determine  whether  it  is  necessary  to  perform  a  quantitative  impairment  test.  However,  we  may  elect  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  in  any  period  and
proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. Our quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to
the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. Using a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses using the Greenfield approach.
The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up
company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant
would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date. If the estimated fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses is less than the
aggregated carrying amount of the wireless licenses, then an impairment charge is recognized. As part of our qualitative assessment, we consider several qualitative factors
including  the  business  enterprise  value  of  our  Wireless  segment,  macroeconomic  conditions  (including  changes  in  interest  rates  and  discount  rates),  industry  and  market
considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA), margin projections, the recent and projected financial performance of our Wireless segment, as well as other factors.
See Note 4 for additional information regarding our impairment tests.

Interest expense incurred while qualifying activities are performed to ready wireless licenses for their intended use is capitalized as part of wireless licenses. The capitalization
period ends when the development is discontinued or substantially completed and the license is ready for its intended use.

Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization and Long-Lived Assets

Our intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives (primarily customer lists and non-network internal-use software) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. All of
our intangible assets subject to amortization, and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indications of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the
net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the
next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment, if any. We re-evaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each year to
determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives.

For information related to the carrying amount of goodwill, wireless licenses and other intangible assets, as well as the major components and average useful lives of our other
acquired intangible assets, see Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market  participants.  The  three-tier  hierarchy  for  inputs  used  in  measuring  fair  value,  which  prioritizes  the  inputs  used  in  the
methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3—No observable pricing inputs in the market

Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the
significance  of  a  particular  input  to  the  fair  value  measurements  requires  judgment  and  may  affect  the  valuation  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  being  measured  and  their
categorization within the fair value hierarchy.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we
operate.

Deferred  income  taxes  are  provided  for  temporary  differences  in  the  basis  between  financial  statement  and  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Deferred  income  taxes  are
recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce
our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of
the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate
taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
measured  to  determine  the  amount  of  benefit  to  recognize  in  the  financial  statements.  The  tax  position  is  measured  at  the  largest  amount  of  benefit  that  is  greater  than  50
percent  likely  of  being  realized  upon  ultimate  settlement.  Differences  between  tax  positions  taken  in  a  tax  return  and  amounts  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  will
generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax
asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.

Significant management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our effective tax rate.

Verizon  has  completed  its  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  the Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (TCJA), including  analyzing  the  effects  of  any  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  and  U.S.
Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion
provisional amount previously recorded.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. See Note 10 for
additional information.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate income statement amounts at average exchange rates
for the period, and we translate assets and liabilities at end-of-period exchange rates. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We report exchange gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term nature in
Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other exchange gains and losses are reported in income.

Employee Benefit Plans

Pension  and  postretirement  health  care  and  life  insurance  benefits  earned  during  the  year,  as  well  as  interest  on  projected  benefit  obligations,  are  accrued  currently.  Prior
service  costs  and  credits  resulting  from  changes  in  plan  benefits  are  generally  amortized  over  the  average  remaining  service  period  of  the  employees  expected  to  receive
benefits.  Expected  return  on  plan  assets  is  determined  by  applying  the  return  on  assets  assumption  to  the  actual  fair  value  of  plan  assets.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses  are
recognized in operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon
management employees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional information.

We recognize a pension or a postretirement plan’s funded status as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we measure any unrecognized prior
service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income tax.

Derivative Instruments

We  enter  into  derivative  transactions  primarily  to  manage  our  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates.  We  employ  risk  management
strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. See Note 9 for additional information.

We measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative instruments are valued primarily
using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of
derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative
instruments  is  recognized  in  earnings,  along  with  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item.  For  cash  flow  hedges,  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative
instruments, along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item, are reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is
recognized  in  earnings.  For  net  investment  hedges  of  certain  of  our  foreign  operations,  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  instruments  is  reported  in  Other
comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offset the impact of foreign currency changes on the value of our net investment.

Variable Interest Entities

VIEs  are  entities  that  lack  sufficient  equity  to  permit  the  entity  to  finance  its  activities  without  additional  subordinated  financial  support  from  other  parties,  have  equity
investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
The primary beneficiary is the party that has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to
absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

The following ASUs were issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and have been recently adopted by Verizon.

Description

Date of
Adoption

Effect on Financial Statements

  ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

This standard update, along with related subsequently issued updates, clarifies the
principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for
U.S. GAAP. The standard update amends current guidance for the recognition of
costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers such that incremental costs of
obtaining and direct costs of fulfilling contracts with customers will be deferred and
amortized consistent with the transfer of the related good or service. The standard
update intends to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues;
improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries,
jurisdictions, and capital markets; and provide more useful information to users of
financial statements through improved disclosure requirements.

  ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)

The amendments in this update make targeted improvements to GAAP by requiring
most equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. For investments in equity securities without readily
determinable fair values, the cost method is eliminated. A practicability exception is
available for investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable
fair values. These investments may be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus
or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions
for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

This update simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without
readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify
impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates impairment exists, an entity is
required to measure the investment at fair value

1/1/2018 We recorded the pre-tax cumulative effect of $3.9 billion ($2.9 billion
net of tax) as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of
Retained earnings. We adopted this standard using the modified
retrospective method. The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes
made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of this standard
are reflected in the table below.

See Note 2 for additional information related to revenues and contract
costs, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures required under
Topic 606, as well as a reconciliation of the adjustments from the
adoption of Topic 606 relative to Topic 605 on certain impacted
financial statement line items.

1/1/2018 We adopted this standard update on a prospective basis resulting in an

insignificant adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The
amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable
fair values are applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as
of the date of adoption.

  ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

This standard update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of
reducing the existing diversity in practice for these issues. This standard update
requires, among other things, that cash receipts from payments on a transferor’s
beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables be classified as cash inflows
from investing activities.

The amendment relating to beneficial interests in securitization transactions
impacted our presentation of collections of certain deferred purchase price from
sales of wireless device payment plan agreement receivables in our consolidated
statements of cash flows.

1/1/2018 We retrospectively reclassified approximately $0.6 billion of deferred

purchase price collections from Cash flows from operating activities to
Cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1.1 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no other significant
impacts as a result of adopting this standard.

Description

  ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

The amendments in this update require that cash and cash equivalent balances in a
statement of cash flows include those amounts deemed to be restricted cash and
restricted cash equivalents.

Date of
Adoption

1/1/2018

1/1/2018

  ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)

The amendments in this update require an employer to report the service cost
component arising from employer sponsored pension and other postretirement plans
in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services
rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net
benefit cost, including the recognition of prior service credits, will be presented in
the consolidated statements of income separately from the service cost component
and outside the subtotal of income from operations. The amendments in this update
also allow only the service cost component of pension and other postretirement
benefit costs to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. Verizon previously
recorded service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost in operating
expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amendments in this update
allow a practical expedient that permits an employer to use the amounts disclosed in
its employee benefits footnote for the prior comparative periods as the estimation
basis for applying the retrospective presentation.

  ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)

The amendments in this update allow a reclassification from accumulated other
comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from
TCJA. The stranded tax effects result from the change in the federal tax rate for
deferred taxes recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard
update is effective as of the first quarter of 2019; however, early adoption is
permitted. Verizon has elected to early adopt this update effective January 1, 2018
and record the effects of adoption at the beginning of the period of adoption.

1/1/2018

Effect on Financial Statements

 We have provided a reconciliation from Cash and cash equivalents as
presented in our consolidated balance sheets to Cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash as reported in our consolidated statements of cash
flows. We adopted the amendments in this accounting standard update
on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard update for the
year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in cash flow used
in financing activities of $0.6 billion, a decrease in cash flow provided
by operating activities of $0.1 billion and an insignificant increase in
cash flow used in investing activities. There was an insignificant impact
to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

See "Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash" for additional
information, as well as a discussion of the nature of our restricted cash
balances.

As required by the amendments in this update, the presentation of the
service cost component and other components of net periodic benefit
cost in the consolidated statements of income were applied
retrospectively, and the updates for the capitalization of the service cost
component of net periodic benefit cost in assets were applied
prospectively on and after the effective date. Verizon reclassified the
other components of net periodic benefit costs from Cost of services
and Selling, general and administrative expense to Other income
(expense), net, which is part of non-operating expenses. The
retrospective adoption of this standard update had an insignificant
impact to consolidated operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and an increase to consolidated operating income of
approximately $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
These impacts to consolidated operating income were fully offset by an
insignificant decrease and a $2.2 billion decrease to Other income
(expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. There was no impact to consolidated Net income for the
years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.

Verizon utilized the practical expedient to estimate the impact on the
prior comparative period information presented in the consolidated
statements of income.

The adoption of this standard update resulted in a charge to Retained
earnings of $0.7 billion which consists primarily of stranded tax effects
related to deferred taxes for pensions and postretirement benefits. It is
Verizon’s policy to release income tax effects from accumulated other
comprehensive income at the same time that the related unit of account
affects net income. The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made
to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of this standard are
reflected in the table below.

The cumulative after-tax effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of Topic 606, ASU 2018-02 and other ASUs was as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The following ASUs have been recently issued by the FASB.

  ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)

Description

In February 2016, the FASB issued this standard update to increase transparency
and improve comparability by requiring entities to recognize assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet for all leases, with certain exceptions. In addition, through
improved disclosure requirements, the standard update will enable users of financial
statements to further understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. This standard update allows for a modified retrospective
application and is effective as of the first quarter of 2019; however, early adoption
is permitted. Entities are allowed to apply the modified retrospective approach: (1)
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
with the cumulative-effect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented; or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period
of adoption (January 1, 2019) through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The effective
date of this standard is January 1, 2019, at which time Verizon will adopt the
standard using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect
adjustment to opening retained earnings recorded at the beginning of the period of
adoption. Therefore, upon adoption, Verizon will recognize and measure leases
without revising comparative period information or disclosure. The modified
retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that
entities may elect to apply.

Effect on Financial Statements

1/1/2019 We have established a cross-functional coordinated team to implement

the standard update. We have completed our assessment of the
transition practical expedients offered by the standard. These practical
expedients lessen the transitional burden of implementing the standard
update by not requiring a reassessment of certain conclusions reached
under existing lease accounting guidance. Accordingly, we will apply
these practical expedients and will not reassess: (1) whether an expired
or existing contract is a lease or contains an embedded lease; (2) lease
classification of an expired or existing lease; (3) initial direct costs for
an existing lease; and (4) whether an existing or expired land easement
is or contains a lease if it has not historically been accounted for as a
lease. We have identified and implemented a new system solution to
meet the requirements of the new standard and have identified and
implemented processes and internal controls to meet the standards
reporting and disclosure requirements.

Upon adoption of this standard, there will be a significant impact in our
consolidated balance sheet as we expect to recognize a right-of-use
asset and liability related to substantially all operating lease
arrangements, which we currently estimate will range between $21.0
billion and $23.0 billion. Verizon’s current operating lease portfolio
included in this range is primarily comprised of network equipment
including towers, distributed antenna systems, and small cells, real
estate, connectivity mediums including dark fiber, and equipment
leases. In addition, pre-tax deferred gains of approximately $0.6 billion
arising from prior period sales-leaseback transactions, which would
have been recognized to income over an average period of nine years,
will be adjusted through opening retained earnings on January 1, 2019.
Lastly, we expect a lower amount of lease costs to qualify as initial
direct costs under the new standard which will result in an immediate
recognition of expense instead of recognition of expense over time.

Effect on Financial Statements

  ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)

In June 2016, the FASB issued this standard update which requires certain financial
assets be measured at amortized cost net of an allowance for estimated credit losses
such that the net receivable represents the present value of expected cash collection.
In addition, this standard update requires that certain financial assets be measured at
amortized cost reflecting an allowance for estimated credit losses expected to occur
over the life of the assets. The estimate of credit losses must be based on all relevant
information including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amounts. An entity will
apply the update through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. A
prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-
than-temporary impairment has been recognized before the effective date. Early
adoption of this standard is permitted.

1/1/2020 We are currently evaluating the impacts that this standard update will
have on our various financial assets which we expect to include, but is
not limited to, our device payment plan agreement receivables and
service receivables.  We have established a cross-functional coordinated
team to address the potential impacts to our systems, processes and
internal controls in order to meet the standard update's accounting and
reporting requirements.

Note 2. Revenue and Contract Costs

We earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. We
account for these revenues under Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. We also earn revenues that are not accounted for
under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the
interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.

We applied the new revenue recognition standard to customer contracts not completed at the date of initial adoption. For incomplete contracts that were modified before the
date  of  adoption,  the  Company  elected  to  use  the  practical  expedient  available  under  the  modified  retrospective  method,  which  allows  us  to  aggregate  the  effect  of  all
modifications  when  identifying  satisfied  and  unsatisfied  performance  obligations,  determining  the  transaction  price  and  allocating  transaction  price  to  the  satisfied  and
unsatisfied performance obligations for the modified contract at transition. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while
amounts reported for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.

In our Wireless business, prior to the adoption of Topic 606, we were required to limit the revenue recognized when a wireless device was sold to the amount of consideration
that was not contingent on the provision of future services, which was typically limited to the amount of consideration received from the customer at the time of sale. Under
Topic 606, the total consideration in the contract is allocated between wireless equipment and service based on their relative standalone selling prices. This change primarily
impacts  our  arrangements  that  include  sales  of  wireless  devices  at  subsidized  prices  in  conjunction  with  a  fixed-term  plan,  also  known  as  the  subsidy  model,  for  service.
Accordingly, under Topic 606, generally more equipment revenue is recognized upon sale of the equipment to the customer and less service revenue is recognized over the
contract term than was previously recognized under the prior "Revenue Recognition" (Topic 605) standard. At the time the equipment is sold, this allocation results in the
recognition of a contract asset equal to the difference between the amount of revenue recognized and the amount of consideration received from the customer. As of January
2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term plans with subsidized equipment pricing; however, we continue to offer fixed-term plans to our business customers. At
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately 14% and 19% of retail postpaid connections were under fixed-term plans, respectively.

Topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs incurred to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expense, over the respective periods of expected benefit. As a result, a significant amount of our sales commission costs, which were historically expensed as
incurred by our Wireless and Wireline businesses under our previous accounting, are now deferred and amortized under Topic 606.

Finally, under Topic 605, at the time of the sale of a device, we imputed risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We recorded the imputed
interest as a reduction to the related accounts receivable and interest income was recognized over the financed device payment term. Under Topic 606, while there continues to
be a financing component in both the fixed-term plans and device payment plans, also known as the installment model, we have determined that this financing component for
our customer classes in the Wireless direct channel plans is not significant and therefore we no longer impute interest for these contracts. This change results in additional
revenue recognized upon the sale of wireless devices and no interest income recognized over the device payment term.

We operate and manage our business in two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services, and customer groups, respectively,
which we view as the relevant categorization of revenues for these businesses. See Note 13 for additional information on revenue by segment.

Corporate and other includes the results of our Media business, Verizon Media, which operated in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, and our telematics business, branded Verizon
Connect.  Oath  generated  revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  under  Topic  606  of  approximately  $7.7 billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2018.  Verizon  Connect
generated revenues from contracts with customers under Topic 606 of approximately $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We also earn revenues, that are not accounted for under Topic 606, from leasing arrangements (such as towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily
related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent. Revenues
from arrangements that were not accounted for under Topic 606 were approximately $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Remaining Performance Obligations

When allocating the total contract transaction price to identified performance obligations, a portion of the total transaction price may relate to service performance obligations
which were not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Below we disclose information relating to these unsatisfied performance obligations. We
have  elected  to  apply  the  practical  expedient  available  under  Topic  606,  that  provides  the  option  to  exclude  the  expected  revenues  arising  from  unsatisfied  performance
obligations  related  to  contracts  that  have  an  original  expected  duration  of  one  year  or  less.  This  situation  primarily  arises  with  respect  to  certain  month-to-month  service
contracts.  At  December  31,  2018,  month-to-month  service  contracts  represented  approximately  86%  of  Wireless  postpaid  contracts  and  approximately  56%  of  Wireline
consumer and small business contracts.

Additionally, certain Wireless and Wireline contracts provide customers the option to purchase additional services. The fee related to the additional services is recognized when
the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).

Wireless customer contracts are generally either month-to-month and cancellable at any time (typically under a device payment plan) or contain terms greater than one month
(typically under a fixed-term plan). Additionally, customers may incur charges based on usage or may purchase additional optional services in conjunction with entering into a
contract which can be cancelled at any time and therefore are not included in the transaction price. When a service contract is longer than one month, the service contract term
will generally be two years or less. The transaction price allocated to service performance obligations, which are not satisfied or are partially satisfied as of the end of the
reporting period, are generally related to our fixed-term plans.

Our wireless customers also include other telecommunications companies who utilize Verizon's network to resell wireless service to their respective end customers. Reseller
arrangements occur on a month-to-month basis or include a stated contract term, which generally extends longer than two years. Arrangements with a stated contract term
generally include an annual minimum revenue commitment over the term of the contract for which revenues will be recognized in future periods.

At December 31, 2018, the transaction price related to Wireless unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized for 2019, 2020 and thereafter was $10.9 billion,
$5.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.

Wireline customer contracts are either month-to-month, include a specified term with fixed monthly fees, or contain revenue commitments, and may also contain usage based
services. Consumer Markets customers under contract generally have a service term of two years; however, this term may be shorter at month-to-month. Certain Enterprise
Solutions,  Partner  Solutions  and  Business  Markets  service  contracts  with  customers  extend  into  future  periods,  contain  fixed  monthly  fees  and  usage-based  fees,  and  can
include annual commitments per each year of the contract or commitments over the entire specified contract term. A significant number of contracts within these businesses
have a contract term that is twelve months or less.

At December 31, 2018, the transaction price relating to Wireline unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized for 2019, 2020 and thereafter was $7.7 billion,
$3.2 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.

In certain Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets service contracts within Wireline and certain telematics service contracts within Corporate and other,
there are customer contracts that have a contractual minimum fee over the total contract term. We cannot predict the time period when revenue will be recognized related to
those  contracts;  thus  they  are  excluded  from  the  time  bands  above.  These  contracts  have  varying  terms  spanning  over  five  years  ending  in  June 2023  and  have  aggregate
contract minimum payments totaling $3.9 billion.

Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of billing to our customers. Receivables presented in our consolidated balance sheet represent an unconditional
right  to  consideration.  Contract  balances  represent  amounts  from  an  arrangement  when  either  Verizon  has  performed,  by  transferring  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  in
advance of receiving all or partial consideration for such goods and services from the customer, or the customer has made payment to Verizon in advance of obtaining control
of the goods and/or services promised to the customer in the contract.

Contract  assets  primarily  relate  to  our  rights  to  consideration  for  goods  or  services  provided  to  the  customers  but  for  which  we  do  not  have  an  unconditional  right  at  the
reporting date. Under a fixed-term plan, the total contract revenue is allocated between wireless services and equipment revenues, as discussed above. In conjunction with these
arrangements, a contract asset is created, which represents the difference between the amount of equipment revenue recognized upon sale and the amount of consideration
received from the customer. The contract asset is reclassified as accounts receivable as wireless services are provided and billed. We have the right to bill the customer as
service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as
Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We assess our contract assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and will recognize an impairment charge to the extent their
carrying amount is not recoverable. The impairment charge related to contract assets was $0.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, and is included in Other in the
table below.

Contract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill service
one  month  in  advance,  which  is  the  primary  component  of  the  contract  liability  balance.  Contract  liabilities  are  recognized  as  revenue  when  services  are  provided  to  the
customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.

Topic 606 requires the recognition of an asset for incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, which are then amortized to expense, over the respective periods of expected
benefit. We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to internal sales personnel and agents in conjunction with obtaining customer contracts. We only
defer these costs when we have determined the commissions are, in fact, incremental

and  would  not  have  been  incurred  absent  the  customer  contract.  Costs  to  obtain  a  contract  are  amortized  and  recorded  ratably  as  commission  expense  over  the  period
representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. Wireless costs to obtain contracts are amortized over our customers' estimated device upgrade cycles, as
such costs are typically incurred each time a customer upgrades. Wireline costs to obtain contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period for
our Consumer Markets customers. Incremental costs to obtain contracts for our Enterprise Solutions, Partner Solutions and Business Markets are insignificant. These costs are
recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.

We  also  defer  costs  incurred  to  fulfill  contracts  that:  (1)  relate  directly  to  the  contract;  (2)  are  expected  to  generate  resources  that  will  be  used  to  satisfy  our  performance
obligation under the contract; and (3) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs are expensed to Cost of services as
we satisfy our performance obligations. These costs principally relate to direct costs that enhance our Wireline business resources, such as costs incurred to install circuits.

We determine the amortization periods for our costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a customer contract at a portfolio level due to the similarities within these customer contract
portfolios.

Other costs, such as general costs or costs related to past performance obligations, are expensed as incurred.

Collectively, costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are referred to as Deferred contract costs, which were as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized expense of $2.0 billion, associated with the amortization of Deferred contract costs, primarily within Selling, general
and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

We assess our Deferred contract costs for impairment on a quarterly basis. We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the
remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those
goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Wireless

Spectrum License Transactions

Since 2016, we have entered into or completed several strategic spectrum transactions including:

•

•

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) to exchange certain Advanced Wireless Services
(AWS) and Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in March 2016. As a result, we received $0.4 billion
of  AWS  and  PCS  spectrum  licenses  at  fair  value  and  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain  of  $0.1 billion  in  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our  consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  we  entered  into  a  license  exchange  agreement  with  affiliates  of  Sprint  Corporation  (Sprint)  to  exchange  certain  AWS  and  PCS
spectrum licenses. This non-cash exchange was completed in September 2016. As a result, we received $0.3 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value
and recorded an insignificant gain in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of AT&T to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. This
non-cash exchange was completed in February 2017. As a result, we received $1.0 billion of AWS and PCS spectrum licenses at fair value and recorded a pre-tax gain
of $0.1 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During  the  first  quarter  of  2017,  we  entered  into  a  license  exchange  agreement  with  affiliates  of  Sprint  to  exchange  certain  PCS  spectrum  licenses.  This  non-cash
exchange  was  completed  in  May  2017.  As  a  result,  we  received  $0.1 billion  of  PCS  spectrum  licenses  at  fair  value  and  recorded  an  insignificant  gain  in  Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into a license exchange agreement with affiliates of T-Mobile USA Inc. to exchange certain AWS and PCS spectrum
licenses.  This  non-cash  exchange  was  completed  in  December  2017.  As  a  result,  we  received  $0.4 billion  of  AWS  and  PCS  spectrum  licenses  at  fair  value  and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.1 billion in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

During 2018, we entered into and completed various wireless license transactions, including the purchase of Straight Path Communications Inc. (Straight Path) and
NextLink Wireless LLC (NextLink).

Straight Path

In May 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Straight Path, a holder of millimeter wave spectrum configured for fifth-generation (5G) wireless services, for
total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay: (1) Straight Path shareholders
$184.00 per share, payable in Verizon shares; and (2) certain transaction costs payable in cash of approximately $0.7 billion, consisting primarily of a fee to be paid to the FCC.
The transaction closed in February 2018 at which time we issued approximately 49 million shares of Verizon common stock, valued at approximately $2.4 billion, and paid the
associated cash consideration.

The  acquisition  of  Straight  Path  was  accounted  for  as  an  asset  acquisition,  as  substantially  all  of  the  value  related  to  the  acquired  spectrum.  Upon  closing,  we  recorded
approximately $4.5 billion of wireless licenses and $1.4 billion of a deferred tax liability. The spectrum acquired as part of the transaction is being used for our 5G technology
deployment. See Note 4 for additional information.

Wireline

Access Line Sale

In February 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and
related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and
long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including
the  assumption  of $0.6 billion of  indebtedness  from  Verizon  by  Frontier. The  transaction,  which  included  the  acquisition  by  Frontier  of  the  equity  interests  of  Verizon’s
incumbent  local  exchange  carriers  (ILECs)  in  California,  Florida  and  Texas,  did  not  involve  any  assets  or  liabilities  of  Verizon  Wireless.  The  transaction  closed  on
April 1, 2016.

The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios  video  subscribers and the
related ILEC businesses from Verizon. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these businesses generated revenues of approximately $1.3 billion and operating income of $0.7
billion for Verizon. The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results
consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.

During April 2016, Verizon used the net cash proceeds received of $9.9 billion to reduce its consolidated indebtedness. See Note 7 for additional information. As a result of the
closing  of  the  transaction,  we  derecognized  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $9.0  billion,  goodwill  of  $1.3  billion,  $0.7  billion  of  defined  benefit  pension  and  other
postretirement benefit plan obligations and $0.6 billion of indebtedness assumed by Frontier.

We  recorded  a  pre-tax  gain  of  approximately  $1.0  billion  in  Selling,  general  and  administrative  expense  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  income  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2016. The pre-tax gain included a $0.5 billion pension and postretirement benefit curtailment gain due to the elimination of the accrual of pension and other
postretirement  benefits  for  some  or  all  future  services  of  a  significant  number  of  employees  covered  by  three  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  plans  and  one  of  our  other
postretirement benefit plans.

XO Holdings

In February 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based Internet
Protocol and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently, we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO
Holdings, NextLink, that held its wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to buy NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our
acquisition  of  XO  for  total  cash  consideration  of  approximately $1.5 billion,  of  which $0.1 billion  was  paid  in  2015,  and  we  prepaid $0.3  billion  in  connection  with  the
NextLink option which represented the fair value of the option.

In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately $0.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments, of which $0.3 billion was prepaid in the first quarter of
2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired
spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion of wireless licenses, $0.1 billion of a deferred tax liability and $0.1 billion of other liabilities. The spectrum
acquired as part of the transaction will be used for our 5G technology deployment.

The consolidated financial statements include the results of XO's operations from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of XO had been completed as of January 1,
2016, the results of operations of Verizon would not have been significantly different than our previously reported results of operations.

The acquisition of XO was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as
of the close of the acquisition. We recorded approximately $1.2 billion of property, plant and equipment, $0.1 billion of goodwill and $0.2 billion of other intangible assets.
Goodwill  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired.  The  goodwill
included within our Wireline segment, represents future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition. See Note 4 for additional information.

Data Center Sale

In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix, Inc. (Equinix) pursuant to which we agreed to sell
23 customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments (Data Center Sale). The transaction closed in
May 2017.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, these sites generated an insignificant amount of revenues and earnings. As a result of the closing of the transaction, we
derecognized assets with a carrying value of $1.4 billion, primarily consisting of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. The liabilities associated
with the sale were insignificant.

In connection with the Data Center Sale and other insignificant divestitures, we recorded a net gain on sale of divested businesses of approximately $1.8 billion in Selling,
general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

WideOpenWest, Inc.

In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW!), a leading
provider  of  communications  services.  The  transaction  closed  in  December  2017.  In  addition,  the  parties  entered  into  a  separate  agreement  pursuant  to  which  WOW!  will
complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions is approximately $0.3 billion, of which $0.2 billion was  received  in
December 2017.

Other

Acquisition of AOL Inc.

In May 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AOL Inc. (AOL) pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of AOL at a price of $50.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

On June 23, 2015, we completed the tender offer and merger, and AOL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the
closing of these transactions was approximately $3.8 billion. Holders of approximately 6.6 million shares exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law. In September 2018,
we obtained court approval to settle this matter for total cash consideration of $0.2 billion of which an insignificant amount relates to interest, resulting in an insignificant gain.
We paid the cash consideration in October 2018.

Acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.’s Operating Business

In July 2016, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’s operating business for approximately $4.83 billion
in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction).

In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million to
approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties also agreed that certain user security and data breaches incurred by
Yahoo  (and  the  losses  arising  therefrom)  were  to  be  disregarded:  (1)  for  purposes  of  specified  conditions  to  Verizon’s  obligations  to  close  the  Transaction;  and  (2)  in
determining whether a "Business Material Adverse Effect" under the Purchase Agreement had occurred.

Concurrently with the amendment of the Purchase Agreement, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo that Verizon agreed to purchase pursuant
to the Transaction, also entered into an amendment to the related reorganization agreement, pursuant to which Yahoo (which has changed its name to Altaba Inc. following the
closing of the Transaction) retains 50% of certain post-closing liabilities arising out of governmental or third-party investigations, litigations or other claims related to certain
user security and data breaches incurred by Yahoo prior to its acquisition by Verizon, including an August 2013 data breach disclosed by Yahoo on December 14, 2016. At that
time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In accordance with the original

Transaction  agreements,  Yahoo  will  continue  to  retain 100% of  any  liabilities  arising  out  of  any  shareholder  lawsuits  (including  derivative  claims)  and  investigations  and
actions by the SEC.

In June 2017, we completed the Transaction. The aggregate purchase consideration at the closing of the Transaction was approximately $4.7 billion, including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion.

Prior to the closing of the Transaction, pursuant to a related reorganization agreement, Yahoo transferred all of the assets and liabilities constituting Yahoo’s operating business
to the subsidiaries that we acquired in the Transaction. The assets that we acquired did not include Yahoo’s ownership interests in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan and certain other
investments,  certain  undeveloped  land  recently  divested  by  Yahoo,  certain  non-core  intellectual  property  or  its  cash,  other  than  the  cash  from  its  operating  business  we
acquired.  We  received  for  our  benefit  and  that  of  our  current  and  certain  future  affiliates  a  non-exclusive,  worldwide,  perpetual,  royalty-free  license  to  all  of  Yahoo’s
intellectual property that was not conveyed with the business.

In October 2017, based upon information that we received in connection with our integration of Yahoo's operating business, we disclosed that we believe that the August 2013
data breach previously disclosed by Yahoo affected all of its accounts.

The acquisition of Yahoo’s operating business has been accounted for as a business combination. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined
using the income, cost, market and multiple period excess earnings approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable
in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, other than long-term
debt  assumed  in  the  acquisition.  The  income  approach  was  primarily  used  to  value  the  intangible  assets,  consisting  primarily  of  acquired  technology  and  customer
relationships.  The  income  approach  indicates  value  for  an  asset  based  on  the  present  value  of  cash  flow  projected  to  be  generated  by  the  asset.  Projected  cash  flow  is
discounted  at  a  required  rate  of  return  that  reflects  the  relative  risk  of  achieving  the  cash  flow  and  the  time  value  of  money.  The  cost  approach,  which  estimates  value  by
determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for property, plant and equipment. The cost to replace a
given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the property, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.

In June 2018, we finalized the accounting for the Yahoo acquisition. The following table summarizes the final accounting for of the assets acquired, including cash acquired of
$0.2 billion, and liabilities assumed as of the close of the acquisition, as well as the fair value at the acquisition date of Yahoo’s noncontrolling interests:

(1) Adjustments to the fair value measurements to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would
have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. The most significant adjustments related to an increase in goodwill and the recognition of liabilities
per certain pre-acquisition contingencies.

On the closing date of the Transaction, each unvested and outstanding Yahoo restricted stock unit award that was held by an employee who became an employee of Verizon
was replaced with a Verizon restricted stock unit award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. The value of those outstanding restricted stock
units on the acquisition date was approximately $1.0 billion.

Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill was
primarily  attributable  to  increased  synergies  that  were  expected  to  be  achieved  from  the  integration  of  Yahoo’s  operating  business  into  our  Media  business.  The  goodwill
related to this acquisition is included within Corporate and other. See Note 4 for additional information.

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Yahoo’s operating business from the date the acquisition closed. If the acquisition of Yahoo’s operating business
had been completed as of January 1, 2016, the results of operations of Verizon would not have been significantly different than our previously reported results of operations.

Acquisition and Integration Related Charges

Related to the Yahoo Transaction, we recorded $0.5 billion of acquisition and integration related charges during the year ended December 31, 2018, of which $0.3 billion, $0.2
billion  and  an  insignificant  amount  are  related  to  Severance,  Integration  costs  and  Transaction  costs,  respectively.  In  connection  with  the  Yahoo  Transaction,  we  recorded
acquisition and integration related charges of approximately $0.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $0.5 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion related
to Severance, Integration costs and Transaction costs, respectively. These charges were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements
of income.

Fleetmatics Group PLC

In  July  2016,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  Fleetmatics  Group  PLC,  a  public  limited  company  incorporated  in  Ireland  (Fleetmatics). Fleetmatics  was  a  leading
global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we acquired Fleetmatics for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash.
The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $0.1 billion. We completed the acquisition on November 7, 2016. As a result of
the transaction, Fleetmatics became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon.

The consolidated financial statements include the results of Fleetmatics’ operations from the date the acquisition closed. Had this acquisition been completed on January 1,
2016,  the  results  of  operations  of  Verizon  would  not  have  been  significantly  different  than  our  previously  reported  results  of  operations.  Upon  closing,  we  recorded
approximately $1.4 billion of goodwill and $1.1 billion of other intangibles.

The acquisition of Fleetmatics was accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair
values as of the close of the acquisition.

Goodwill  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired.  The  goodwill
recorded  as  a  result  of  the  Fleetmatics  transaction  represents  future  economic  benefits  we  expect  to  achieve  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition.  The  goodwill  related  to  this
acquisition is included within Corporate and other. See Note 4 for additional information.

Other

In  July  2016,  we  acquired  Telogis, Inc.,  a  global  cloud-based  mobile  enterprise  management  software  business,  for  $0.9 billion  of  cash  consideration.  Upon  closing,  we
recorded $0.5 billion of goodwill that is included within Corporate and other.

During 2018, we entered into and completed various other transactions for $0.1 billion of cash consideration. During 2017 and 2016, we entered into and completed various
other transactions for an insignificant amount of cash consideration.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $4.5 billion of wireless licenses in connection with the Straight Path acquisition and $0.7 billion in
connection with the NextLink acquisition. See Note 3 for additional information.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, of wireless licenses were under development for commercial service for which we
were capitalizing interest costs. We recorded approximately $0.5 billion of capitalized interest on wireless licenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
respectively.

The average remaining renewal period of our wireless license portfolio was 4.6 years as of December 31, 2018. See Note 1 for additional information.

As  discussed  in  Note 1,  we  test  our  wireless  licenses  for  potential  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  impairment  indicators  are  present.  In  2018,  our  quantitative
impairment test consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses estimated using the Greenfield approach to the aggregated carrying amount
of the licenses as of the test date. In 2017 and 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless
licenses was less than the carrying amount. Our assessments in 2018, 2017 and 2016 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the carrying value and,
therefore, did not result in impairment.

We recognized goodwill of $2.1 billion within the Media reporting unit (included within Other in the table above) as a result of the acquisition of Yahoo's operating business
and $0.1 billion in Wireline as a result of the acquisition of XO. See Note 3 for additional information.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Wireless, Wireline, Connect and Media reporting units. Based on our assessment, it was
determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount of each of our reporting units except for our Media reporting unit. Our Media business, Verizon Media, which
operated in 2018 under the "Oath" brand, has continued to experience increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that have resulted in lower than expected
revenues and earnings. These pressures are expected to continue and have resulted in a loss of market positioning to our competitors in the digital advertising business. Oath
has also achieved lower than expected benefits from the integration of the Yahoo and AOL businesses.

In connection with Verizon’s annual budget process in the fourth quarter, the new leadership at both Oath and Verizon completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning
review of Oath’s business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to Oath’s financial projections. These revised projections were used as a key input into the Company’s
annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter.

Consistent with our accounting policy, we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including
our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the fair value of the Media reporting unit being less than its carrying amount. As a result, we
recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 in our consolidated statement of income.
The goodwill balance of the Media reporting unit was approximately $4.8 billion prior to the incurrence of this impairment charge.

We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in 2018 and for all of our reporting units, except for our Wireless reporting unit, in 2017 and
2016 for which a qualitative assessment was completed. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, our impairment tests indicated that the fair value for each of our Wireless, Wireline and
Connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value and therefore, did not result in a goodwill impairment. For 2017 and 2016, our impairment tests indicated that
the fair value for our Media reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore, did not result in goodwill impairment.

During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to
lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the
towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Under this agreement, total rent payments for the towers amounted to
$0.3 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect to make minimum future lease payments of approximately $1.8 billion. We continue to include
the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. Towers related to this transaction that were included in
Property, plant and equipment, net, amounted to $0.4 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. In addition, the minimum future payments for the ground
leases of approximately $2.5 billion is included in our operating lease commitments. As part of the rights obtained during the transaction, American Tower is responsible for
the payment of the leases, and we do not expect to be required to make payments unless American Tower defaults.

Asset-Backed Debt

As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our asset-backed debt was $10.1 billion. Our asset-backed debt includes notes (the Asset-Backed Notes) issued to third-party
investors  (Investors)  and  loans  (ABS  Financing  Facilities)  received  from  banks  and  their  conduit  facilities  (collectively,  the  Banks).  Our  consolidated  asset-backed  debt
bankruptcy remote legal entities (each, an ABS Entity or collectively, the ABS Entities) issue the debt or are otherwise party to the transaction documentation in connection
with our asset-backed debt transactions. Under the terms of our asset-backed debt, we transfer device payment plan agreement receivables from Cellco Partnership (Cellco) and
certain other affiliates of Verizon (collectively, the Originators) to one of the ABS Entities, which in turn transfers such receivables to another ABS Entity that issues the debt.
Verizon entities retain the equity interests in the ABS Entities, which represent the rights to all funds not needed to make required payments on the asset-backed debt and other
related payments and expenses.

Our asset-backed debt is secured by the transferred device payment plan agreement receivables and future collections on such receivables. The device payment plan agreement
receivables transferred to the ABS Entities and related assets, consisting primarily of restricted cash, will only be available for payment of asset-backed debt and expenses
related thereto, payments to the Originators in respect of additional transfers of device payment plan agreement receivables, and other obligations arising from our asset-backed
debt transactions, and will not be available to pay other obligations or claims of Verizon’s creditors until the associated asset-backed debt and other obligations are satisfied.
The  Investors  or  Banks,  as  applicable,  which  hold  our  asset-backed  debt  have  legal  recourse  to  the  assets  securing  the  debt,  but  do  not  have  any  recourse  to  Verizon  with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt. Under a parent support agreement, Verizon has agreed to guarantee certain of the payment obligations of Cellco and
the Originators to the ABS Entities.

Cash  collections  on  the  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  collateralizing  our  asset-backed  debt  securities  are  required  at  certain  specified  times  to  be  placed  into
segregated accounts. Deposits to the segregated accounts are considered restricted cash and are included in Prepaid expenses and other, and Other assets in our consolidated
balance sheets.

Proceeds  from  our  asset-backed  debt  transactions  are  reflected  in  Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  in  our  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  cash  flows.  The  asset-
backed debt issued and the assets securing this debt are included in our consolidated balance sheets.

Under the terms of each series of Asset-Backed Notes, there is a two year revolving period during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity. The two
year revolving period of the Asset-Backed Notes we issued in July 2016 and November 2016 ended in July 2018 and November 2018 respectively, and we began to repay
principal on the 2016-1 Class A senior Asset-Backed Notes and the 2016-2 Class A senior Asset-Backed Notes in August 2018 and December 2018, respectively. During 2018,
we made aggregate repayments of $0.6 billion.

ABS Financing Facility

In May 2018, we entered into a second device payment plan agreement financing facility with a number of financial institutions (2018 ABS Financing Facility). Under the
terms of the 2018 ABS Financing Facility, the financial institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of business
customers for proceeds of $0.5 billion. The loan agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 ABS Financing Facility has a final maturity date in December 2021 and
bears interest at a floating rate. There is a one year revolving period beginning from May 2018 during which we may transfer additional receivables to the ABS Entity. Subject
to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables from the ABS Entity. Under the loan agreement, we have the right to prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time
without  penalty,  but  in  certain  cases,  with  breakage  costs.  If  we  choose  to  prepay,  the  amount  prepaid  shall  be  available  for  further  drawdowns  until  May  2019,  except  in
certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the 2018 ABS Financing Facility is fully drawn and the outstanding borrowing under the 2018 ABS Financing Facility was
$0.5 billion.

We  entered  into  an  ABS  Financing  Facility  in  September  2016  with  a  number  of  financial  institutions  (2016  ABS  Financing  Facility).  Under  the  terms  of  the  2016  ABS
Financing Facility, the financial institutions made advances under asset-backed loans backed by device payment plan agreement receivables of consumer customers. Two loan
agreements were entered into in connection with the 2016 ABS Financing Facility in September 2016 and May 2017. The loan agreements have a final maturity date in March
2021 and bear interest at floating rates. The two year revolving period of the two loan agreements ended in September 2018. Under the loan agreements, we have the right to
prepay all or a portion of the advances at any time without penalty, but in certain cases, with breakage costs. Subject to certain conditions, we may also remove receivables
from the ABS Entity. As a result of a $1.5 billion drawdown and an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion of prepayments and repayments, aggregate outstanding borrowings under
the two loans agreements were $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Variable Interest Entities

The ABS Entities meet the definition of a VIE for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities of the entity
that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity. Therefore, the assets, liabilities and
activities of the ABS Entities are consolidated in our financial results and are included in amounts presented on the face of our consolidated balance sheets.

The assets and liabilities related to our asset-backed debt arrangements included in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Credit Facilities

In April 2018, we amended our $9.0 billion credit facility to increase the capacity to $9.5 billion and extend its maturity to April 4, 2022. As of December 31, 2018, the unused
borrowing capacity under our $9.5 billion credit facility was approximately $9.4 billion. The credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain
specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. We use the credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit
and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2016, we entered into a $1.0 billion credit facility insured by Eksportkreditnamnden Stockholm, Sweden, the Swedish export credit agency. As of December 31,
2018, the outstanding balance was $0.7 billion. We used this credit facility to finance network equipment-related purchases.

In July 2017, we entered into credit facilities insured by various export credit agencies providing us with the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion to finance equipment-related
purchases. The facilities have borrowings available, portions of which extend through October 2019, contingent upon the amount of eligible equipment-related purchases that
we make. During 2018, we drew down $3.0 billion from these facilities, and $2.8 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we drew down an
additional $0.4 billion from these facilities.

Non-Cash Transaction

During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we financed, primarily through vendor financing arrangements, the purchase of approximately $1.1 billion, $0.5
billion, and $0.5 billion respectively, of long-lived assets consisting primarily of network equipment. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $1.1 billion  and  $1.2
billion, respectively, relating to these financing arrangements, including those

entered into in prior years and liabilities assumed through acquisitions, remained outstanding. These purchases are non-cash financing activities and therefore not reflected
within Capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Early Debt Redemptions

During 2018 and 2017, we recorded losses on early debt redemptions of $0.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.

We recognize losses on early debt redemptions in Other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statements of income and within our Net cash used in financing activities in
our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Guarantees

We guarantee the debentures of our operating telephone company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, $0.8 billion aggregate principal amount of these obligations remained
outstanding. Each guarantee will remain in place for the life of the obligation unless terminated pursuant to its terms, including the operating telephone company no longer
being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon.

We  also  guarantee  the  debt  obligations  of  GTE  LLC,  as  successor  in  interest  to  GTE  Corporation,  that  were  issued  and  outstanding  prior  to  July  1,  2003.  As  of
December 31, 2018, $0.4 billion aggregate principal amount of these obligations remain outstanding.

Debt Covenants

We and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.

Note 8. Wireless Device Payment Plans

Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service
on devices purchased under the device payment program pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge
is included on their wireless monthly bill. As of January 2017, we no longer offer consumers new fixed-term subsidized service plans for phones; however, we continue to offer
subsidized  plans  to  our  business  customers,  and  we  also  continue  to  service  existing  fixed-term  subsidized  plans  for  consumers  who  have  not  yet  purchased  and  activated
devices under the Verizon device payment program.

Included in our device payment plan agreement receivables, net at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, are net device payment plan agreement receivables of $11.5
billion and $10.7 billion,  respectively,  that  have  been  transferred  to  ABS  Entities  and  continue  to  be  reported  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  See  Note 7  for  additional
information. We believe the carrying value of our installment loans receivables approximate their fair value using a Level 3 expected cash flow model.

We may offer certain promotions that allow a customer to trade in their owned device in connection with the purchase of a new device. Under these types of promotions, the
customer  receives  a  credit  for  the  value  of  the  trade-in  device.  In  addition,  we  may  provide  the  customer  with  additional  future  credits  that  will  be  applied  against  the
customer’s monthly bill as long as service is maintained. We recognize a liability for the trade-in device measured at fair value, which is determined by considering several
factors,  including  the  weighted-average  selling  prices  obtained  in  recent  resales  of  similar  devices  eligible  for  trade-in.  Future  credits  are  recognized  when  earned  by  the
customer. Device payment plan agreement receivables, net does not reflect the trade-in device liability. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amount of trade-in
liability was $0.1 billion and insignificant, respectively.

From time to time, we offer certain marketing promotions that allow our customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a certain specified portion of the required
device payment plan agreement amount as well as trading in their device in good working order. When a

customer enters into a device payment plan agreement with the right to upgrade to a new device, we account for this trade-in right as a guarantee obligation.

For Wireless indirect channel contracts with customers, we impute risk adjusted interest on the device payment plan agreement receivables. We record the imputed interest as a
reduction to the related accounts receivable. Interest income, which is included within Service revenues and other in our consolidated statements of income, is recognized over
the financed device payment term. See Note 2 for additional information on financing considerations with respect to Wireless direct channel contracts with customers.

When originating device payment plan agreements, we use internal and external data sources to create a credit risk score to measure the credit quality of a customer and to
determine eligibility for the device payment program. If a customer is either new to Verizon Wireless or has less than 210 days of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (a
new customer), the credit decision process relies more heavily on external data sources. If the customer has 210 days or more of customer tenure with Verizon Wireless (an
existing customer), the credit decision process relies on internal data sources. Verizon Wireless’ experience has been that the payment attributes of longer tenured customers are
highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. External data sources include obtaining a credit report from a national consumer credit reporting
agency, if available. Verizon Wireless uses its internal data and/or credit data obtained from the credit reporting agencies to create a custom credit risk score. The custom credit
risk score is generated automatically (except with respect to a small number of applications where the information needs manual intervention) from the applicant’s credit data
using Verizon Wireless’ proprietary custom credit models, which are empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound. The credit risk score measures the likelihood
that the potential customer will become severely delinquent and be disconnected for non-payment. For a small portion of new customer applications, a traditional credit report
is not available from one of the national credit reporting agencies because the potential customer does not have sufficient credit history. In those instances, alternate credit data
is used for the risk assessment.

Based on the custom credit risk score, we assign each customer to a credit class, each of which has specified offers of credit including an account level spending limit and
either a maximum amount of credit allowed per device or a required down payment percentage. During the fourth quarter of 2018 Verizon Wireless moved all customers, new
and existing, from a required down payment percentage, between zero and 100%, to a maximum amount of credit per device.

Subsequent to origination, Verizon Wireless monitors delinquency and write-off experience as key credit quality indicators for its portfolio of device payment plan agreements
and  fixed-term  service  plans.  The  extent  of  our  collection  efforts  with  respect  to  a  particular  customer  are  based  on  the  results  of  proprietary  custom  empirically  derived
internal behavioral scoring models that analyze the customer’s past performance to predict the likelihood of the customer falling further delinquent. These customer scoring
models  assess  a  number  of  variables,  including  origination  characteristics,  customer  account  history  and  payment  patterns.  Based  on  the  score  derived  from  these  models,
accounts  are  grouped  by  risk  category  to  determine  the  collection  strategy  to  be  applied  to  such  accounts.  We  continuously  monitor  collection  performance  results  and  the
credit quality of our device payment plan agreement receivables based on a variety of metrics, including aging. Verizon Wireless considers an account to be delinquent and in
default status if there are unpaid charges remaining on the account on the day after the bill’s due date.

Sales of Wireless Device Payment Plan Agreement Receivables

In 2015 and 2016, we established programs pursuant to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (RPA) to sell from time to time, on an uncommitted basis, eligible device payment
plan agreement receivables to a group of primarily relationship banks (Purchasers) on both a revolving and non-revolving basis, collectively the Programs. In December 2017,
the  RPA  and  all  other  related  transaction  documents  were  terminated.  Under  the  Programs,  eligible  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  were  transferred  to  the
Purchasers for upfront cash proceeds and additional consideration upon settlement of the receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price.

There were no sales of device payment plan agreement receivables under the Programs during 2017. During 2016, we sold $3.3 billion of receivables, net of allowance and
imputed interest, under the Revolving Program. We received cash proceeds from new transfers of $2.0 billion and cash proceeds from reinvested collections of $0.9 billion and
recorded a deferred purchase price of $0.4 billion.

The sales of receivables under the RPA did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income. The cash proceeds received from the Purchasers were
recorded within Cash flows provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Deferred Purchase Price

The deferred purchase price was initially recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as an Other asset at fair value, based on the remaining device payment amounts expected
to be collected, adjusted, as applicable, for the time value of money and by the timing and estimated value of the device trade-in in connection with upgrades. The estimated
value  of  the  device  trade-in  considered  prices  expected  to  be  offered  to  us  by  independent  third  parties.  This  estimate  contemplated  changes  in  value  after  the  launch  of  a
device. The fair value measurements were considered to be Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The collection of the deferred purchase price was contingent
on collections from customers. During 2017, we repurchased all outstanding receivables previously sold to the Purchasers in exchange for the obligation to pay the associated
deferred purchase price to the wholly-owned subsidiaries that were bankruptcy remote special purpose entities (Sellers). At December 31, 2017, our deferred purchase price
receivable was fully satisfied.

Collections following the repurchase of receivables were $0.2 billion during both 2018 and 2017. Collections of deferred purchase price were $1.4 billion during 2017 and $1.1
billion during 2016. These collections were recorded in Cash flows used in investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Variable Interest Entities

As  the  Programs  were  terminated  in  December  2017,  VIEs  related  to  the  sale  of  wireless  device  payment  plan  receivables  did  not  exist  at  December  31,  2018  or
December 31, 2017.

During 2017, under the RPA, the Sellers’ sole business consisted of the acquisition of the receivables from Cellco and certain other affiliates of Verizon and the resale of the
receivables to the Purchasers. The assets of the Sellers were not available to be used to satisfy obligations of any Verizon entities other than the Sellers. We determined that the
Sellers were VIEs as they lack sufficient equity to finance their activities. Given that we had the power to direct the activities of the Sellers that most significantly impact the
Sellers’  economic  performance,  we  were  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary  of  the  Sellers.  As  a  result,  we  consolidated  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Sellers  into  our
consolidated financial statements.

Continuing Involvement

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total portfolio of device payment plan agreement receivables that we were servicing was $19.3 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively.
There  were  no  derecognized  device  payment  plan  agreement  receivables  outstanding  at  December  31,  2017.  As  of  December  31,  2017,  we  have  collected  and  remitted
approximately $10.1 billion, net of fees and no amounts remained to be remitted to the Purchasers.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, Verizon had continuing involvement with the sold receivables as it serviced the receivables. We continued to service the customer
and  their  related  receivables  on  behalf  of  the  Purchasers,  including  facilitating  customer  payment  collection,  in  exchange  for  a  monthly  servicing  fee.  While  servicing  the
receivables, the same policies and procedures were applied to the sold receivables that applied to owned receivables, and we continued to maintain normal relationships with
our customers. The credit quality of the customers we continued to service was consistent throughout the periods presented.

In addition, we had continuing involvement related to the sold receivables as we were responsible for absorbing additional credit losses pursuant to the agreements. Credit
losses on receivables sold were $0.1 billion during 2017.

Equity securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investments in common stock of domestic and international corporations measured using quoted prices
in active markets. Equity securities in the table above excludes certain of our equity investments, which were previously accounted for under the cost method, as they do not
have  readily  determinable  fair  values.  Beginning  January  1,  2018  these  investments  have  been  measured  using  a  quantitative  approach  under  the  practicability  exception
offered by ASU 2016-01. Such investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions
for  an  identical  or  similar  investment  of  the  same  issuer  and  are  included  in  Investments  in  unconsolidated  businesses  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets.  As  of
December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values was $0.2 billion. During 2018, there were insignificant adjustments due to
observable price changes and we recognized an insignificant impairment charge.

Fixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. For fixed income securities that do not have quoted prices in active markets, we use alternative
matrix pricing resulting in these debt securities being classified as Level 2.

Derivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative contracts and thus are classified within
Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.

We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2018 and
2017.

Fair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt

The fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical terms and maturities, which is a Level 1 measurement, as well as quoted
prices for similar terms and maturities in inactive markets and future cash flows discounted at current rates, which are Level 2 measurements. The fair value of our short-term
and long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was as follows:

We  enter  into  interest  rate  swaps  to  achieve  a  targeted  mix  of  fixed  and  variable  rate  debt.  We  principally  receive  fixed  rates  and  pay  variable  rates  based  on  the LIBOR,
resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt
issuances. We record the interest rate swaps at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are
recorded to Interest expense, which are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt due to changes in interest rates.

During 2018, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.7 billion and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $1.1 billion. During
2017, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $7.5 billion and settled interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $0.5 billion.

The ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The following amounts were recorded in Long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

We have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar-denominated cash
flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.

During 2018, a pre-tax loss of $0.7 billion was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.

During 2017, we entered into cross currency swaps with a total notional value of $14.0 billion and settled $10.2 billion notional amount of cross currency swaps. A pre-tax
gain of $1.4 billion was recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) with respect to these swaps.

A  portion  of  the  gains  and  losses  recognized  in  Other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  was  reclassified  to  Other  income  (expense),  net  to  offset  the  related  pre-tax  foreign
currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item.

Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps

We  have  entered  into  forward  starting  interest  rate  swaps  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  in  order  to  manage  our  exposure  to  interest  rate  changes  on  future  forecasted
transactions.

During 2018, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $4.0 billion. During 2018, a pre-tax loss of $0.1 billion was recognized in Other
comprehensive income (loss).

We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows of based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance.

Net Investment Hedges

We have designated certain foreign currency instruments as net investment hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to non-U.S. dollar net investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries against changes in foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of the Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge was $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion
at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Undesignated Derivatives

We also have the following derivative contracts which we use as economic hedges but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting.

Interest Rate Caps

We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our ABS Financing Facility and Asset-Backed Notes. During 2017, we entered into
interest rate caps with a notional value of $0.3 billion. During both 2018 and 2017, we recognized an insignificant amount in Interest expense.

Foreign Exchange Forwards

We enter into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary
assets  and  liabilities  of  international  subsidiaries.  During  2018,  we  entered  into  foreign  exchange  forwards  with  a  total  notional  value  of  $2.8 billion  and  settled  foreign
exchange forwards with a total notional value of $2.2 billion.

Treasury Rate Locks

We entered into treasury rate locks with a total notional value of $2.0 billion to hedge the tender offers conducted in September 2018 for eight series of notes issued by Verizon
with  coupon  rates ranging from 3.850% to 5.012%  and  maturity  dates  ranging  from  2039  to  2055  (September  Tender  Offers).  Upon  the  early  settlement  of  the  September
Tender Offers, we settled these hedges. During 2018, we recognized an insignificant loss related to treasury rate locks in Other income (expense), net.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, short-term and long-term investments, trade receivables,
including device payment plan agreement receivables, certain notes receivable, including lease receivables and derivative contracts.

Counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements (ISDA master agreements) and credit support
annex (CSA) agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange. Our CSA agreements entered into prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 generally require collateralized
arrangements with our counterparties in connection with uncleared derivatives. During 2017, we paid an insignificant amount of cash to extend amendments to certain of our
collateral exchange arrangements, which eliminated the requirement to post collateral for a specified period of time. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we began
negotiating and executing new ISDA master agreements and CSA agreements with our counterparties. The negotiations and executions of new agreements continued in 2018.
The  newly  executed  CSA  agreements  contain  rating  based  thresholds  such  that  we  or  our  counterparties  may  be  required  to  hold  or  post  collateral  based  upon  changes  in
outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. At December 31, 2018, we posted collateral of approximately $0.1 billion related to
derivative  contracts  under  collateral  exchange  arrangements,  which  were  recorded  as  Prepaid  expenses  and  other  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheet.  We  did  not  post  any
collateral at December 31, 2017. While we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties, we consider the risk remote and do not expect that
any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties.

Note 10. Stock-Based Compensation

Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan

In May 2017, Verizon’s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to grant new awards under the Verizon
2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan,
Verizon  reserved  the  number  of  shares  that  were  remaining  but  not  issued  under  the  2009  Plan.  Shares  subject  to  outstanding  awards  under  the  2009  Plan  that  expire,  are
canceled or

otherwise terminated will also be available for the awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, 89 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017
Plan.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock
upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting
period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted
under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.

In February 2018, Verizon announced a broad-based employee special award of RSUs under the 2017 Plan to eligible full-time and part-time employees. These RSUs will vest
in two equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date, and will be paid in cash.

In connection with our acquisition of Yahoo’s operating business, on the closing date of the Transaction each unvested and outstanding Yahoo RSU award that was held by an
employee who became an employee of Verizon was replaced with a Verizon RSU award, which is generally payable in cash upon the applicable vesting date. These awards are
classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Performance Stock Units

The 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As defined by the 2017 Plan, the
Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals
have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs are classified as liability awards because the PSU awards are paid in cash upon vesting. The PSU award
liability  is  measured  at  its  fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  and,  therefore,  will  fluctuate  based  on  the  price  of  Verizon  common  stock  as  well  as  performance
relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units, which will be paid to participants at the time that PSU award is determined and
paid, and in the same proportion as the PSU award. The granted and cancelled activity for the PSU award includes adjustments for the performance goals achieved.

As of December 31, 2018, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Verizon’s RSUs and PSUs was approximately $1.1 billion and is expected to
be recognized over approximately two years.

The equity RSUs granted in 2018 and 2017 have weighted-average grant date fair values of $49.19 and $49.93 per unit, respectively. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid
$0.8 billion, $0.8 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, to settle RSUs and PSUs classified as liability awards.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

After-tax compensation expense for stock-based compensation related to RSUs and PSUs described above included in Net income attributable to Verizon was $0.7 billion, $0.4
billion and $0.4 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Note 11. Employee Benefits

We  maintain  non-contributory  defined  benefit  pension  plans  for  certain  employees.  In  addition,  we  maintain  postretirement  health  care  and  life  insurance  plans  for  certain
retirees and their dependents, which are both contributory and non-contributory, and include a limit on our share of

the cost for certain recent and future retirees. In accordance with our accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits, operating expenses include pension and
benefits related credits and/or charges based on actuarial assumptions, including projected discount rates, an estimated return on plan assets, and health care trend rates. These
estimates are updated in the fourth quarter to reflect actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions or upon a remeasurement. The adjustment is recognized in
the income statement during the fourth quarter or upon a remeasurement event pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension and other postretirement benefits for certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Modifications in benefits have been bargained from time to
time, and we may also periodically amend the benefits in the management plans. The following tables summarize benefit costs, as well as the benefit obligations, plan assets,
funded status and rate assumptions associated with pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $19.6 billion and $21.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

2018 Collective Bargaining Negotiations

The  extension  agreement  ratified  in  August  2018  extended  our  collective  bargaining  agreements  with  the  Communications  Workers  of  America  and  the  International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that were due to expire on August 3, 2019 for four years until August 5, 2023.  The collective bargaining agreements cover approximately
34,000 employees. Amendments triggered by the collective bargaining negotiations were made to certain pension plans for certain union represented employees and retirees.
The impact of the plan amendments was an increase in our defined benefit pension plans plan obligations and a net decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income of
$0.2 billion (net  of  taxes of $0.2 billion).  The  annual  impact  of  the  amount  recorded  in  Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  that  will  be  reclassified  to  net  periodic
benefit cost is minimal.

2017 Postretirement Plan Amendments

During 2017, amendments were made to certain postretirement plans related to retiree medical benefits for management and certain union represented employees and retirees.
The impact of the plan amendments was a reduction in our postretirement benefit plan obligations of approximately $0.5 billion, which has been recorded as a net increase to
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.3 billion (net of taxes of $0.2 billion).  The impact of the amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income that
will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost is insignificant.

2016 Collective Bargaining Negotiations

During 2016, we adopted changes to our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect the agreed upon terms and conditions of the collective
bargaining agreements ratified in June 2016. The impact includes a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.9 billion (net of taxes of $1.8 billion). The
amount recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period
of the respective plans’ participants, which, on a weighted-average basis, is 12.2 years for defined benefit pension plans and 7.8 years for other postretirement benefit plans.
The above-noted reclassification resulted in a decrease to net periodic benefit cost and increase to pre-tax income of approximately $0.7 billion, $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion,
respectively, during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Amounts reclassified to net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the reclassification to Selling, general and administrative expense of a pre-tax pension and
postretirement benefit curtailment gain of $0.5 billion ($0.3 billion  net  of  taxes)  due  to  the  transfer  of  employees  to  Frontier,  which  caused  the  elimination  of  a  significant
amount of future service in three of our defined benefit pension plans and one of our other postretirement benefit plans requiring us to recognize a portion of the prior service
credits. See Note 3 for additional information.

The estimated prior service cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit (income)
cost  over  the  next  fiscal  year  is  $0.1 billion.  The  estimated  prior  service  cost  for  the  defined  benefit  postretirement  plans  that  will  be  amortized  from  Accumulated  other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit income over the next fiscal year is $1.0 billion.

In determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, we used a weighted-average discount rate of 4.40% in 2018. The rates were selected to approximate
the composite interest rates available on a selection of high-quality bonds available in the market at December 31, 2018. The bonds selected had maturities that coincided with
the time periods during which benefits payments are expected to occur, were non-callable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability (at least $0.3 billion par
outstanding).

In order to project the long-term target investment return for the total portfolio, estimates are prepared for the total return of each major asset class over the subsequent 10-year
period. Those estimates are based on a combination of factors including the current market interest rates and valuation levels, consensus earnings expectations and historical
long-term risk premiums. To determine the aggregate return for the pension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation
to that investment area in the trust’s long-term asset allocation policy.

The company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. While
target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed so that 52.5% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in
excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, private equities, real estate, hedge funds and emerging debt) and 45.5% of the assets are invested as liability
hedging assets (where cash flows from investments better match projected benefit payments, typically longer duration fixed income) and 2.0% is in cash. This allocation will
shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target policies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives.
Both active and passive management approaches are used depending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control
processes, there are no significant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names.

Pension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon common stock.

The following are general descriptions of asset categories, as well as the valuation methodologies and inputs used to determine the fair value of each major category of assets.

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  short-term  investment  funds  (less  than  90  days  to  maturity),  primarily  in  diversified  portfolios  of  investment  grade  money  market
instruments and are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation methods. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature
of these investments.

Investments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if no
sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, international bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix
prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-counter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last
business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes.

Commingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). Commingled funds held by third-party
custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund managers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian
of the respective plan.

The  investment  manager  of  the  entity  values  venture  capital,  corporate  finance,  and  natural  resource  limited  partnership  investments.  Real  estate  investments  are  valued  at
amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment manager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data.
Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance or appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based
upon available and current market information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
estimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These differences could be material.

Forward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last business day of the year. Both exchange
rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified by the asset class of the underlying holdings.

Hedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on statements received from the investment manager. These funds are valued in accordance with the terms of their
corresponding offering or private placement memoranda.

Commingled funds, hedge funds, venture capital, corporate finance, natural resource and real estate limited partnership investments for which fair value is measured using the
NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total investments.

Employer Contributions

In 2018, we made $1.0 billion discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans and $0.7 billion discretionary contribution to a retiree benefit account to fund health and
welfare  benefits.  Qualified  pension  plans  contributions  are  estimated  to  be  $0.3  billion,  nonqualified  pension  plans  contributions  are  estimated  to  be  $0.1  billion,  and
contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $0.5 billion in 2019.

The benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows:

Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plans

We maintain four leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOP). We match a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions to certain savings plans with shares of
our common stock from this ESOP. At December 31, 2018, the number of allocated shares of common stock in this ESOP was 51 million. There were no unallocated shares of
common stock in this ESOP at December 31, 2018. All leveraged ESOP shares are included in earnings per share computations.

Total savings plan costs were $1.1 billion in 2018, $0.8 billion in 2017 and $0.7 billion in 2016.

Severance, Pension and Benefits (Credits) Charges

During 2018, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $2.1 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period
in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement credits of $2.3 billion, which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of
income, were primarily driven by an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans
from a weighted-average of 3.7% at December 31, 2017 to a weighted-average of 4.4% at December 31, 2018 ($2.6 billion), and mortality and other assumption adjustments of
$1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of which related to healthcare claims and trend adjustments, offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual
return on assets of (2.7)% ($1.9 billion). The credits were partially offset by $0.2 billion due to the effect of participants retiring under the voluntary separation program.

In September 2018, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 10,400 eligible employees will separate
from the Company under this program by the end of June 2019, with nearly half of these employees having exited in December of 2018. Principally as a result of this program
but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company recorded a severance charge of $1.8 billion ($1.4 billion after-tax) during the year ended December
31, 2018, which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income. During 2018, we also recorded $0.3 billion in severance
costs under our other existing separation plan.

During  2017,  we  recorded  net  pre-tax  severance,  pension  and  benefits  charges  of  $1.4 billion,  exclusive  of  acquisition  related  severance  charges,  in  accordance  with  our
accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of approximately $0.9 billion,
which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to
determine the current year liabilities of our pension and postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of 4.2% at December 31, 2016 to a weighted-average of 3.7% at
December 31, 2017 ($2.6 billion). The charges were partially offset by the difference between our estimated return on assets of 7.0% and our actual return on assets of 14.0%
($1.2 billion), a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2017) issued by the Society of Actuaries ($0.2 billion) and other
assumption adjustments ($0.3 billion). As part of these charges, we also recorded severance costs of $0.5 billion under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in
Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

During 2016, we recorded net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges of $2.9 billion in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses
in the period in which they occur. The pension and benefits remeasurement charges of $2.5 billion, which were recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated
statements of income, were primarily driven by a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension and other postretirement
benefit  plans  from  a  weighted-average  of  4.6%  at  December  31,  2015  to  a  weighted-average  of  4.2%  at  December  31,  2016  ($2.1 billion),  updated  health  care  trend  cost
assumptions  ($0.9  billion),  the  difference  between  our  estimated  return  on  assets  of  7.0%  and  our  actual  return  on  assets  of  6.0%  ($0.2  billion)  and  other  assumption
adjustments ($0.3 billion). These charges were partially offset by a change in mortality assumptions primarily driven by the use of updated actuarial tables (MP-2016) issued
by  the  Society of Actuaries ($0.5 billion)  and  lower  negotiated  prescription  drug  pricing  ($0.5 billion).  As  part  of  these  charges,  we  also  recorded  severance  costs  of  $0.4
billion under our existing separation plans, which were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

The net pre-tax severance, pension and benefits charges during 2016 were comprised of a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.2 billion measured as of March 31,
2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in one of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension and benefits remeasurement
charge of $0.8 billion measured as of April 1, 2016 related to curtailments in three  of  our  defined  benefit  pension  and  one  of  our  other  postretirement  plans,  a  net  pre-tax
pension and benefits remeasurement charge of $2.7 billion measured as of May 31, 2016 in two defined benefit pension plans and three other postretirement benefit plans as a
result of our accounting for the contractual healthcare caps and bargained for changes, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.1 billion measured as of May 31, 2016
related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in three of our defined benefit pension plans, a net pre-tax pension remeasurement charge of $0.6
billion measured as of August 31, 2016 related to settlements for employees who received lump-sum distributions in five of our defined benefit pension plans, and a net pre-tax
pension  and  benefits  credit  of  $1.9 billion  as  a  result  of  our  fourth  quarter  remeasurement  of  our  pension  and  other  postretirement  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  updated
actuarial assumptions.

The following table shows the principal reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate:

18.3 %

(48.3)%

35.2 %

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 18.3% compared to (48.3)% for 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to
the non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $16.8 billion recorded in 2017 for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate
income tax rate, as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In addition, the current period provision for income taxes includes the tax impact of the Oath
goodwill impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes, offset by the current year reduction in the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%,
effective January 1, 2018 under the TCJA and a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of an internal reorganization of legal entities within
the Wireless business.

In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their
accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate
of the impacts of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any
subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate.  Pursuant to SAB 118, Verizon recorded a provisional estimate of $16.8 billion for the impacts of the TCJA, primarily due
to the re-measurement of its U.S. deferred income tax liabilities at the lower 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, with no significant impact from the transition tax on
repatriation, the implementation of the territorial tax system, or limitations on the deduction of interest expense. Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA,
including analyzing the effects of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the maximum one year
measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion provisional amount previously recorded.

The  effective  income  tax  rate  for  2017  was  (48.3)%  compared  to  35.2%  for  2016.  The  decrease  in  the  effective  income  tax  rate  and  the  provision  for  income  taxes  was
primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the enactment of the TCJA described above.

At December  31,  2018,  undistributed  earnings  of  our  foreign  subsidiaries  indefinitely  invested  outside  the  U.S.  amounted  to  approximately  $3.0 billion.  The  majority  of
Verizon's  cash  flow  is  generated  from  domestic  operations  and  we  are  not  dependent  on  foreign  cash  or  earnings  to  meet  our  funding  requirements,  nor  do  we  intend  to
repatriate these undistributed foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.  Furthermore, a portion of these undistributed earnings represents amounts that legally must be kept in
reserve in accordance with certain foreign jurisdictional requirements and are unavailable for distribution or repatriation.  As a result, we have not provided U.S. deferred taxes
on these undistributed earnings because we intend that they will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and therefore unavailable for use in funding U.S. operations.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

At December 31, 2018, we had net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately $3.6 billion that primarily relate to state and foreign taxes.
Of these net after-tax loss and credit carry forwards, approximately $2.1 billion will expire between 2019 and 2038 and approximately $1.5 billion  may  be  carried  forward
indefinitely.

During 2018, the valuation allowance decreased approximately $0.6 billion. The balance of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2018 and the 2018 activity is primarily
related to state and foreign taxes.

Verizon and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, we are under audit
by the IRS and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions for various open tax years. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013-
2014 and Cellco Partnership's U.S. income tax return for tax year 2013-2014. Tax controversies are ongoing for tax years as early as 2005. The amount of the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that
various current tax examinations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the possible change
cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved.

Note 13. Segment Information

Reportable Segments

We  have  two  reportable  segments,  Wireless  and  Wireline,  which  we  operate  and  manage  as  strategic  business  units  and  organize  by  products  and  services,  and  customer
groups, respectively. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of
segment performance.

Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:

Segment
Wireless

Wireline

Description

Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and
government customers across the U.S.

Wireline’s communications products and enhanced services include video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network
services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and
government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.

The Wireline segment is organized in four customer groups: Consumer Markets, which includes consumer retail customers; Enterprise Solutions, which includes large business
customers, including multinational corporations, and federal government customers; Partner Solutions, which includes other carriers that use our facilities to provide services
to their customers; and Business Markets, which includes U.S.-based small and medium business customers, state and local governments, and educational institutions.

Corporate  and  other  includes  the  results  of  our  Media  business,  Verizon  Media,  which  operated  in  2018  under  the  "Oath"  brand,  our  telematics  business,  branded  Verizon
Connect, and other businesses, investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related costs and interest and
financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing
segment  performance  due  to  their  nature.  Although  such  transactions  are  excluded  from  the  business  segment  results,  they  are  included  in  reported  consolidated  earnings.
Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating decision maker’s
assessment of segment performance.

In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. We are modifying our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to
accommodate the new structure and expect to transition to the new segment reporting structure during the second quarter of 2019. We continue to report operating results to our
chief operating decision maker under our current operating segments.

We completed our acquisition of Yahoo's operating business on June 13, 2017.

In May 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale, where we sold 23 customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America to Equinix. The results of operations for
this divestiture and other insignificant transactions are included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent
with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.

In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were reclassified from our Wireline segment effective April 1,
2016. The impact of this reclassification was insignificant to our consolidated financial statements and our segment results of operations.

The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below includes the effects of special items that management
does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily because of their nature.

We have adjusted prior period consolidated and segment information, where applicable, to conform to the current period presentation. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU
2017-07,  "Compensation  -  Retirement  Benefits  (Topic  715):  Improving  the  Presentation  of  Net  Periodic  Pension  Cost  and  Net  Periodic  Postretirement  Benefit  Cost."
Components other than the service component of net periodic pension cost and

periodic postretirement benefit cost (income), inclusive of the mark-to-market pension and benefit remeasurements, have been reclassified from operating to non-operating
charges (benefits) in our consolidated statements of income. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not change how we present our segment results.

In March 2017, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company's common stock. The program will
terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or at the close of business on February 28, 2020, whichever is sooner. During the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, 2018,
the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017, and 2016, we issued 3.5 million, 2.8 million and 3.5 million common shares from Treasury stock, respectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value.

Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal level. Where it is determined, in
consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the
currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be
made  at  this  time  due  to  various  factors  typical  in  contested  proceedings,  including:  (1)  uncertain  damage  theories  and  demands;  (2)  a  less  than  complete  factual  record;
(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. We continuously
monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any

pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods, including the Hicksville matter described below, will have a material effect on our financial condition, but it could have a
material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period.

Reserves  have  been  established  to  cover  environmental  matters  relating  to  discontinued  businesses  and  past  telecommunications  activities. These  reserves  include  funds  to
address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the
contamination  at  the  site.  An  adjustment  to  the  reserves  may  be  made  after  a  cost  allocation  is  conducted  with  respect  to  the  past  and  future  expenses  of  all  of  the
parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.

Verizon is currently involved in approximately 30  federal  district  court  actions  alleging  that  Verizon  is  infringing  various  patents.  Most  of  these  cases  are  brought  by  non-
practicing entities and effectively seek only monetary damages; a small number are brought by companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well.
These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved.

In  connection  with  the  execution  of  agreements  for  the  sales  of  businesses  and  investments,  Verizon  ordinarily  provides  representations  and  warranties  to  the  purchasers
pertaining  to  a  variety  of  nonfinancial  matters,  such  as  ownership  of  the  securities  being  sold,  as  well  as  indemnity  from  certain  financial  losses.  From  time  to  time,
counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.

Subsequent  to  the  sale  of  Verizon  Information  Services  Canada  in  2004,  we  continue  to  provide  a  guarantee  to  publish  directories,  which  was  issued  when  the  directory
business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, without modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon
Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and Internet yellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not
expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably estimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may
offset each other. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely.

As  of  December  31,  2018,  letters  of  credit  totaling  approximately  $0.6  billion,  which  were  executed  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  support  several  financing
arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.

We have several commitments, totaling $22.2 billion, primarily to purchase programming and network services, equipment, software and marketing services, which will be
used or sold in the ordinary course of business, from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $8.8 billion is attributable to 2019, $9.1 billion is attributable to 2020 through
2021, $2.1 billion is attributable to 2022 through 2023 and $2.2 billion is attributable to years thereafter. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the
future,  but  represent  only  those  items  that  are  the  subject  of  contractual  obligations.  Our  commitments  are  generally  determined  based  on  the  noncancelable  quantities  or
termination amounts. Purchases against our commitments totaled approximately $9.0 billion for 2018, $8.2 billion for 2017, and $8.1 billion for 2016. Since the commitments
to purchase programming services from television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of
subscribers  at  December  31,  2018,  and  applicable  rates  stipulated  in  the  contracts  in  effect  at  that  time.  We  also  purchase  products  and  services  as  needed  with  no  firm
commitment.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed an internal reorganization of legal entities within the Wireless business and recorded a non-recurring deferred tax benefit of
approximately $2.1 billion on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reduced our deferred tax liability by the same amount.

Corporate Tax Reform

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time corporate tax reduction of approximately $16.8 billion in (Provision) benefit for income taxes in our consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Verizon has completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA, including analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S.
Treasury  guidance  issued,  and  state  tax  law  changes  enacted,  within  the  maximum  one  year  measurement  period  resulting  in  no  significant  adjustments  to  the  provisional
amount previously recorded.
