Separation

• Company expects increased 2023 Reported Sales Growth of 7.0% - 8.0%, Operational Sales Growth of 7.5% - 8.5%, and

Adjusted Operational Sales Growth of 6.2% - 7.2%; Figures exclude the COVID-19 Vaccine

• Company  expects  2023  Adjusted  Reported  Earnings  Per  Share  (EPS)  of  $10.00  -  $10.10,  reflecting  increased  growth  of
12.5% at the mid-point and Adjusted Operational EPS of $9.90 - $10.00, reflecting increased growth of 11.5% at the mid-
point

• Company reduced outstanding share count by approximately 191 million; 2023 guidance reflects only a partial-year benefit

of approximately 73.5 million shares or $0.28 benefit to EPS

• Company secured $13.2 billion in cash proceeds from the Kenvue debt offering and initial public offering and maintains 9.5%

of equity stake in Kenvue

• Company maintains its quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share

New Brunswick, N.J. (August 30, 2023) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (“the Company”) today announced updates to its financials and

2023 guidance which reflect its operations as a company focused on transformational innovation in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The

Company has published a recorded webinar for investors to provide additional context behind the updated financials and 2023 guidance

found in this release, which may be accessed by visiting the Investors section of the Company's website at webcasts & presentations.

“The completion of this transaction uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a Pharmaceutical and MedTech company focused on delivering

transformative healthcare solutions to patients,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. “We are incredibly

proud of the focus and dedication of our employees worldwide to achieve this milestone, which we are confident will unlock near- and long-

term value for all of our stakeholders.”

As previously announced, the Company recently completed an exchange offer to finalize the separation of Kenvue Inc., formerly Johnson &

Johnson’s  Consumer  Health  business.  As  a  result  of  the  completion  of  the  exchange  offer,  Johnson  &  Johnson  will  now  present  its

Consumer Health business financial results as discontinued operations, including a gain of approximately $20 billion in the third quarter of

2023.

Unless otherwise noted, the financial results and earnings guidance included below have been recast to reflect the continuing operations of

Johnson & Johnson.

FINANCIAL RESULTS:

1
 Non-GAAP financial measure; refer to reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures included in accompanying schedules
2
 Excludes the impact of translational currency
3
 Excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and translational currency
4

Note: values may have been rounded

REGIONAL SALES RESULTS:

SEGMENT SALES RESULTS:

3
 Excludes the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and translational currency

UPDATED FULL-YEAR 2023 GUIDANCE:

Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict with

reasonable  certainty  the  ultimate  outcome  of  legal  proceedings,  unusual  gains  and  losses,  acquisition-related  expenses  and  purchase

accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material

to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Note: percentages may have been rounded

Following completion of the Kenvue exchange offer, the Company has reduced its outstanding share count by the approximately 191 million

shares of common stock accepted in the exchange offer.

The  weighted  average  shares  outstanding  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  August  2023  Guidance  for  Adjusted  Diluted  EPS  reflects  the  net

reduction of approximately 73.5 million shares of Johnson & Johnson outstanding common stock as a result of the Kenvue exchange offer.

Because this net reduction occurred on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson will recognize only a partial-year benefit of $0.28 to its full-year

2023 Adjusted Diluted EPS.

The Company generated $13.2 billion in cash proceeds as result of the Kenvue debt offering and initial public offering. Additionally, Johnson

& Johnson maintains a 9.5% stake in Kenvue common stock, which provides the Company the opportunity to monetize the retained stake in

a tax efficient manner in the next year, subject to a

current 90-day lockup agreement. Johnson & Johnson is under no obligation to do so if market conditions are not supportive.

The Company will maintain its quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share.

Johnson & Johnson has published a recorded webinar for investors to provide additional context behind the updated financials and 2023

NOTE TO INVESTORS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among

other  things:  future  operating  and  financial  performance,  product  development,  and  market  position  and  business  strategy.  The  reader  is

cautioned  not  to  rely  on  these  forward-looking  statements.  These  statements  are  based  on  current  expectations  of  future  events.  If

underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the

expectations  and  projections  of  Johnson  &  Johnson.  Risks  and  uncertainties  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  economic  factors,  such  as

interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by

competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory

approvals;  uncertainty  of  commercial  success  for  new  and  existing  products;  challenges  to  patents;  the  impact  of  patent  expirations;  the

ability  of  the  Company  to  successfully  execute  strategic  plans,  including  restructuring  plans;  the  impact  of  business  combinations  and

divestitures; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product

recalls  or  regulatory  action;  significant  adverse  litigation  or  government  action,  including  related  to  product  liability  claims;  changes  to

applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; changes in

behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services; financial instability of international economies and legal

systems  and  sovereign  risk;  increased  scrutiny  of  the  health  care  industry  by  government  agencies;  the  Company’s  ability  to  realize  the

anticipated benefits from the separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business; and the New Consumer Health Company’s ability to

succeed as a standalone publicly traded company. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found

in  Johnson  &  Johnson’s  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  January  1,  2023,  including  in  the  sections  captioned

(A)
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,"
"adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations," and "adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations" are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be
considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations,
net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate from continuing operations on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures
provide useful information to investors. Among other things, these measures may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various
periods, these measures may exclude such items as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, significant costs associated with acquisitions, restructuring,
litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that
sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the
performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings from
continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate
from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings from
continuing operations, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations may not be comparable with the
calculation of similar measures for other companies. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the
Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, the effects of an
acquisition, restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters) and do not provide a comparable view of the
Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior
to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE “Adjusted operational sales growth" excludes acquisitions, divestitures and translational
currency and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as

acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact they may have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends,
management believes that providing this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance and may assist
