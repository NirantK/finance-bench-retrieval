“Ulta Beauty’s strong fourth quarter results punctuate an exceptional year with record sales,
profitability, and member growth, reflecting robust demand and best-in-class execution,” said
Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. “For the first time in our 33-year history, Ulta Beauty’s
annual revenue surpassed ten billion dollars, our annual net income exceeded one billion
dollars, and we exceeded 40 million Ultamate Rewards members. These milestone
achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty’s highly differentiated model, the health
of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.”

Kimbell continued, “As we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and
resiliency of the beauty category, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue
to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for
all our stakeholders.”

For the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022

Net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the
beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product
innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales)
increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021,
driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat
compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs,
favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher
inventory shrink.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7
million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage
of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive
compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and
benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to
strategic investments.
Operating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared
to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
The tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2021.
Net income increased 17.8% to $340.8 million compared to $289.4 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021.
Diluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to
income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a
$0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021.

For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022

Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.
Operating income increased 26.3% to $1.6 billion, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to
$1.3 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2021.
The tax rate increased to 24.4% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021.
Net income increased 26.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021.

Diluted earnings per share increased 33.5% to $24.01, including a $0.07 benefit due to
income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $17.98 including a
$0.13 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in fiscal
2021.

Balance Sheet

Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $737.9
million.

Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $1.6
billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The $104.2
million increase was primarily due to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022,
inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions, and inventory cost
increases.

Share Repurchase Program

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 722,457 shares of its
common stock at a cost of $328.1 million. During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 2.2
million shares of its common stock at a cost of $900.0 million. As of January 28, 2023, $1.1
billion remained available under the $2.0 billion share repurchase program announced in
