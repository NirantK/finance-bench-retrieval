PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 9, 2023 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) today reported results

for the fourth quarter and full-year 2022.

“We  are  pleased  with  our  results  for  the  fourth  quarter  and  the  full  year  as  our  business

remained resilient and delivered another strong year of growth. Our results demonstrate that the

investments  we  have  made  in  our  people,  brands,  portfolio,  value  chain,  and  go-to-market

systems are working,” said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.

Laguarta continued, “Moving forward, we will continue to focus on driving growth and winning in

the marketplace while developing advantaged capabilities to fortify our businesses for the long-

term. This includes embedding pep+ at the center of our business in how we innovate, operate,

run our teams, and build our brands.

For 2023, we expect to deliver 6 percent organic revenue growth and 8 percent core constant

currency  earnings  per  share  growth.  We  also  announced  a  10  percent  increase  in  our
annualized dividend, starting with our June 2023 payment which represents our 51st consecutive
annual increase, and plan to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion worth of shares.”

“Guidance  and  Outlook”  for  additional  information  regarding  PepsiCo’s  full-year 2023  financial  outlook.  PepsiCo  provides  guidance  on  a  non-GAAP

basis  as we cannot predict  certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange and commodity

mark-to-market net impacts. PepsiCo’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or

six  years  (53rd  reporting  week).  PepsiCo’s  fourth  quarter  2022  includes  17  weeks  of  results  and  its  2022  fiscal  year  includes  53  weeks  of  results.

(a) Excludes  the  impact  of  acquisitions,  divestitures  and  other  structural  changes  and  the  53rd  reporting  week.  In  certain
instances,  the  impact  of  organic  volume  growth  on  net  revenue  growth  differs  from  the  unit  volume  change  due  to  the
impacts  of  product  mix,  nonconsolidated  joint  venture  volume,  and,  for  our  franchise-owned  beverage  businesses,
temporary  timing  differences  between  bottler  case  sales  (BCS)  and  concentrate  shipments  and  equivalents  (CSE).  We
report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated
joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.

Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Organic  revenue  and  core  constant  currency  results  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures.  Please  refer  to  the  reconciliation  of
GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of “Organic revenue growth,” “Core”
and “Constant currency.”

PepsiCo’s  fiscal  year  ends  on  the  last  Saturday  of  each  December,  resulting  in  an  additional  week  of  results  every  five  or  six
years. PepsiCo’s fourth quarter 2022 includes 17 weeks of results and its 2022 fiscal year includes 53 weeks of results.

Discussion of Fourth-Quarter 2022 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 2 and A-9, reported
operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Operating  profit  increased  9%,  primarily  reflecting  effective  net  pricing  and  productivity  savings.  These
impacts  were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,  including  strategic  initiatives,  a  19-
percentage-point  impact  of  higher  commodity  costs,  primarily  cooking  oil,  seasoning  and  potatoes,  and
higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses.  Additionally,  impairment  charges  associated  with  a  baked
fruit  convenient  food  brand  reduced  operating  profit  growth  by  5  percentage  points.  The  53rd  reporting
week contributed 7 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Quaker Foods North America

Operating  profit  decreased  3%,  primarily  reflecting  a  48-percentage-point  impact  of  higher  commodity
costs,  mainly  grains  and  packaging  materials,  certain  operating  cost  increases,  including  incremental
transportation costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset
by  effective  net  pricing  and  productivity  savings.  The  53rd  reporting  week  positively  contributed  7
percentage  points  to  operating  profit  performance.  Higher  restructuring  and  impairment  charges
negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating profit increased 13%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, higher income from joint ventures
and  productivity  savings.  These  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,
including incremental informational technology costs, a 53-percentage-point impact of higher commodity
costs,  primarily  fuel  and  resin,  an  organic  volume  decline  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing
expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 9 percentage points to operating profit growth. The lower
net revenue due to the sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands and higher restructuring
and  impairment  charges  reduced  operating  profit  growth  by  32  percentage  points  and  9  percentage
points, respectively.

Latin America

Operating  profit  increased  5%,  primarily  reflecting  net  revenue  growth,  productivity  savings,  a  7-
percentage-point  favorable  impact  of  adjusting  certain  non-income  tax  accruals  in  Mexico  and  a  3-
percentage-point  favorable  impact  of  lower  charges  taken  as  a  result  of  the  novel  coronavirus
(COVID-19)  pandemic.  These  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,  a  45-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, grains and packaging materials,
higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses  and  a  4-percentage-point  unfavorable  impact  of  certain
indirect  tax  credits  in  Brazil  in  the  prior  year. Additionally,  a  favorable  adjustment  to  the  final  purchase
price  associated  with  our  sale  of  certain  non-strategic  brands  contributed  3  percentage  points  to
operating profit growth.

Europe

Operating  profit  decreased  420%,  primarily  reflecting  a  400-percentage-point  unfavorable  impact  of
impairment  charges  related  to  the  SodaStream  brand  (other  impairment  charges).  Operating  profit
performance was also negatively impacted by a 141-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs,
primarily  packaging  materials,  cooking  oil  and  potatoes,  and  certain  operating  cost  increases.  These
impacts  were  partially  offset  by  effective  net  pricing  and  productivity  savings.  Higher  restructuring  and
impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 10 percentage points.

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating  profit  decreased  148%,  primarily  reflecting  a  105-percentage-point  impact  of  impairment  and
other  charges  associated  with  our  decision  to  sell  or  discontinue  certain  non-strategic  brands  and  an
investment (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 21-percentage-point impact of impairment charges

3

primarily  related  to  certain  juice  brands  from  the  Pioneer  Food  Group  Ltd.  (Pioneer  Foods)  acquisition
(other  impairment  charges).  Operating  profit  performance  was  also  negatively  impacted  by  a  167-
percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains, cooking oil and packaging materials,
certain  operating  cost  increases  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses,  partially  offset  by  net
revenue  growth  and  productivity  savings.  Unfavorable  foreign  exchange  negatively  impacted  operating
profit performance by 15 percentage points.

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating  profit  decreased  215%,  primarily  reflecting  a  237-percentage-point  impact  of  impairment
charges related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges) and a 6-percentage-point impact of
impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment due to the discontinuation of a non-strategic
brand  (brand  portfolio  impairment  charges)  in  China.  Operating  profit  performance  was  also  negatively
impacted by a 96-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily potatoes and cooking oil,
certain  operating  cost  increases  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses,  partially  offset  by  net
revenue  growth  and  productivity  savings.  Unfavorable  foreign  exchange  negatively  impacted  operating
profit performance by 11 percentage points.

Discussion of Full-Year 2022 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 5 and A-9, reported
operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America

Operating  profit  increased  9%,  primarily  reflecting  the  effective  net  pricing  and  productivity  savings.
These  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,  including  strategic  initiatives,  a
17-percentage-point  impact  of  higher  commodity  costs,  primarily  cooking  oil,  potatoes  and  seasoning,
and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses.  Additionally,  impairment  charges  associated  with  a
baked  fruit  convenient  food  brand  reduced  operating  profit  growth  by  1.5  percentage  points  (other
impairment charges). The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Quaker Foods North America

Operating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These
impacts were partially offset by a 37-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains
and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, the
decrease  in  organic  volume  and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses.  The  53rd  reporting  week
contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.

PepsiCo Beverages North America

Operating  profit  increased  122%,  primarily  reflecting  a  124-percentage-point  impact  of  the  gain  of  $3.0
billion associated with the  sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands partially offset by a 2-
percentage-point impact of related transaction costs. Operating profit growth was also driven by the net
revenue  growth  and  productivity  savings,  partially  offset  by  certain  operating  cost  increases,  including
incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher
commodity costs, primarily aluminum and resin. A current-year gain associated with the sale of an asset
and  the  53rd  reporting  week  contributed  6  percentage  points  and  2  percentage  points,  respectively,  to
operating profit growth. Additionally, operating profit growth was reduced by a 15-percentage-point impact
of the lower net revenue due to the sale of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands.

Latin America

Operating profit increased 19%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-
percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These
impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 41-percentage-point impact of higher
commodity  costs,  primarily  cooking  oil,  packaging  materials  and  grains,  and  higher  advertising  and
marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment and other charges associated with the sale of certain non-
strategic  brands  reduced  operating  profit  growth  by  4.5  percentage  points  (brand  portfolio  impairment
charges).

Europe

Operating  profit  decreased  207%,  primarily  reflecting  a  110-percentage-point  unfavorable  impact  of
charges  associated  with  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  a  98-percentage-point  unfavorable  impact  of
impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand (other impairment charges) and a 20-percentage-
point  unfavorable  impact  primarily  related  to  the  impairment  of  intangible  assets  due  to  the
discontinuation  or  repositioning  of  certain  juice  and  dairy  brands  in  Russia  (brand  portfolio  impairment
charges), partially offset by a 23-percentage-point favorable impact of the gain associated with the Juice
Transaction. Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 91-percentage-point impact
of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, raw milk and potatoes, certain operating cost
increases,  the  organic  volume  decline,  a  4-percentage-point  impact  of  less  favorable  settlements  of
promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and a 4-percentage-point impact of payments
to  employees  for  a  change  in  pension  benefits. These  impacts  were  partially  offset  by  the  effective  net
pricing,  productivity  savings  and  lower  advertising  and  marketing  expenses.  Unfavorable  foreign
exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points.

6

Africa, Middle East and South Asia

Operating  profit  decreased  22%,  primarily  reflecting  a  19-percentage-point  impact  of  impairment  and
other  charges  associated  with  our  decision  to  sell  or  discontinue  certain  non-strategic  brands  and  an
investment (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 4-percentage-point impact of impairment charges
primarily related to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition (other impairment charges).
Operating  profit  performance  was  also  negatively  impacted  by  a  74-percentage-point  impact  of  higher
commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, grains and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases
and  higher  advertising  and  marketing  expenses,  partially  offset  by  the  net  revenue  growth  and
productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by
9 percentage points.

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region

Operating profit decreased 20%, primarily reflecting a 25-percentage-point impact of impairment charges
related  to  the  Be  &  Cheery  brand  (other  impairment  charges).  Operating  profit  performance  was  also
negatively impacted by a 25-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and
potatoes, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset
by  the  net  revenue  growth  and  productivity  savings.  Additionally,  prior-year  impairment  charges
associated with an equity method investment positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit
performance.  Unfavorable  foreign  exchange  negatively  impacted  operating  profit  performance  by  4
percentage points.

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are

included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity

mark-to-market net impacts.

For 2023, the Company expects:

• A 6 percent increase in organic revenue;

• An 8 percent increase in core constant currency EPS;

• A core annual effective tax rate of 20 percent; and

•

Total  cash  returns  to  shareholders  of  approximately  $7.7  billion,  comprised  of  dividends  of  $6.7

billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion.

In  addition,  the  Company  expects  an  approximate  2-percentage-point  foreign  exchange  translation

headwind  to  impact  reported  net  revenue  and  core  EPS  growth  based  on  current  market  consensus

rates.

This assumption and the guidance above imply 2023 core EPS of $7.20, a 6 percent increase compared

to 2022 core EPS of $6.79.

Dividend Increase

The Company today announced a 10 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from

$4.60  per  share,  effective  with  the  dividend  expected  to  be  paid  in  June  2023.  This  represents  the
Company’s 51st consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

Prepared Management Remarks and Live Question and Answer Webcast

management remarks (in pdf format) regarding its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results, including its

outlook  for  2023,  at  www.pepsico.com/investors. At  8:15  a.m.  (Eastern  time)  on  February  9,  2023,  the

(a) The  increase  in  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  for  the  quarter  and  year  ended December  31,  2022  as  compared  to  the

quarter and year ended December 25, 2021 primarily reflects higher selling and distribution costs.

(b)

(c)

In the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately
$3.5  billion  in  cash  and  a  39%  noncontrolling  interest  in  a  newly  formed  joint  venture,  Tropicana  Brands  Group,  operating  across
North America and Europe (Juice Transaction).

In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges as a result of our quantitative assessments of certain
of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded
pre-tax  impairment  charges  as  a  result  of  our  quantitative  assessments  of  certain  of  our  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  primarily
related  to  the  SodaStream  brand,  and  related  to  the  decrease  in  fair  value  of  our  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  as  a  result  of  the
Russia-Ukraine conflict charges.

(d) Benefit from income taxes in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to tax benefits related to certain impairments  for

local statutory and tax purposes.

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with
U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (GAAP):  organic  revenue  growth,  core  results  and  core  constant  currency
results. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of
our  annual  operating  plan,  evaluation  of  our  overall  business  performance  and  as  a  factor  in  determining  compensation  for
certain  employees.  We  believe  presenting  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provides  additional  information  to  facilitate
comparison  of  our  historical  operating  results  and  trends  in  our  underlying  operating  results  and  provides  additional
transparency  on  how  we  evaluate  our  business.  We  also  believe  presenting  these  measures  allows  investors  to  view  our
performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or
that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which
we  may  make  adjustments  include:  amounts  related  to  mark-to-market  gains  or  losses  (non-cash);  charges  related  to
restructuring  plans;  charges  associated  with  mergers,  acquisitions,  divestitures  and  other  structural  changes;  gains  associated
with  divestitures;  asset  impairment  charges  (non-cash);  pension  and  retiree  medical-related  amounts  (including  all  settlement
and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax
law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt
redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021,
certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items
affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other
net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results. See below for a description of adjustments to our GAAP
financial measures included herein.

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute  for  the  related  financial  information  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  In  addition,  our  non-GAAP  financial
measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures:

Bottler  case  sales  (BCS):  Measure  of  physical  beverage  volume  shipped  to  retailers  and  independent  distributors  from  both
PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates
in  effect  for  the  comparable  prior-year  period.  In  order  to  compute  our  constant  currency  results,  we  multiply  or  divide,  as
appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide,
as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.

Core:  Core  results  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures  which  exclude  certain  items  from  our  historical  results.  For  further
information regarding these excluded items refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2022 Form 10-K. For the periods presented, core results
exclude the following items:

Mark-to-market net impact

Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are
subsequently  reflected  in  division  results  when  the  divisions  recognize  the  cost  of  the  underlying  commodity  in  operating
profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through
the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges

Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the
acquisition-date  balance  sheets  (recorded  in  cost  of  sales),  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with
divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to
support  socioeconomic  programs  in  South  Africa,  gains  associated  with  contingent  consideration,  employee-related  costs,
contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses,
including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

A - 6

Gain associated with the Juice Transaction

We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.

Impairment and Other Charges

We  recognized  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  charges,  brand  portfolio  impairment  charges  and  other  impairment  charges  as
described below.

Russia-Ukraine conflict charges

In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.

Brand portfolio impairment charges

We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result
of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment.

Other Impairment Charges

We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflect an increase in
the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance.

Pension and retiree medical-related impact

Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding
the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.

Charge related to cash tender offers

As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender
price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk
on the cash tender offers.

Tax Benefit Related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Audit

We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the
2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act

Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting
from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Organic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and
other  structural  changes,  and  every  five  or  six  years,  the  impact  of  the  53rd  reporting  week,  including  in  our  2022  financial
results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an
extra  month  of  net  revenue  for  our  acquisitions  of  Pioneer  Foods  in  our  Africa,  Middle  East  and  South  Asia  division  and
Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery) in our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region division
as  we  aligned  the  reporting  calendars  of  these  acquisitions  with  those  of  our  divisions,  as  well  as  divestitures  and  other
structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.
We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes
items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.

2023 guidance

Our 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, the
impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2022 and foreign exchange translation. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and our
2023  core  constant  currency  EPS  growth  guidance  exclude  the  mark-to-market  net  impact  included  in  corporate  unallocated
expenses,  restructuring  and  impairment  charges  and  other  items  noted  above.  Our  2023  core  constant  currency  EPS  growth
guidance  also  excludes  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  translation.  We  are  unable  to  reconcile  our  full  year  projected  2023
organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023
impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to
predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile
our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year
projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable

A - 7

to  predict  the  2023  impact  of  foreign  exchange  or  the  mark-to-market  net  impact  on  commodity  derivatives  due  to  the
unpredictability  of  future  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and  commodity  prices.  Therefore,  we  are  unable  to  provide  a
reconciliation of these measures.

(a) Acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflect the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.
(b) Acquisitions  and  divestitures  primarily  reflect  the  Juice  Transaction  in  our  PepsiCo  Beverages  North  America  and  Europe  divisions,  and  the  alignment  of  the  reporting  calendars  for  the  Pioneer  Foods

acquisition in our Africa, Middle East and South Asia division and the Be & Cheery acquisition in our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region division.

(c) A financial measure that is not in accordance with GAAP. See pages A-6 through A-8 for further discussion.
(d) Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and the 53rd reporting week. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit
volume  change  disclosed  in  the  Summary  Fourth-Quarter  2022  Performance  and  Summary  Full-Year  2022  Performance  tables  on  pages  2  and  5,  respectively,  due  to  the  impacts  of  product  mix,
nonconsolidated  joint  venture  volume,  and,  for  our  franchise-owned  beverage  businesses,  temporary  timing  differences  between  BCS  and  CSE.  We  report  net  revenue  from  our  franchise-owned  beverage
businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.

Note – Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

statements,  although  not  all  forward-looking  statements  contain  such  terms.  Forward-looking  statements  inherently  involve
risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  predicted  in  such  forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine;

concerns  with  respect  to  product  quality  and  safety;  PepsiCo’s  ability  to  compete  effectively;  PepsiCo’s  ability  to  attract,
develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity;
changes  in  the  retail  landscape  or  in  sales  to  any  key  customer;  disruption  of  PepsiCo’s  manufacturing  operations  or  supply

transactions;  PepsiCo’s  reliance  on  third-party  service  providers  and  enterprise-wide  systems;  climate  change  or  measures  to
address  climate  change;  strikes  or  work  stoppages;  failure  to  realize  benefits  from  PepsiCo’s  productivity  initiatives;
deterioration  in  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  regarding  future  performance  that  can  result  in  an  impairment  charge;
fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCo’s credit ratings; imposition
or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCo’s products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or
sale  of  PepsiCo’s  products;  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  related  to  the  use  or  disposal  of  plastics  or  other  packaging
materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax
laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCo’s intellectual property rights or infringement
on  intellectual  property  rights  of  others;  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations;  and  potential  liabilities  and
costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations.

For additional information on these and other factors that could cause PepsiCo’s actual results to materially differ from those set
forth herein, please see PepsiCo’s filings with the SEC, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent
