Overview

Vision,
Mission
and
Strategies

MGM Resorts International’s vision is to be the best-in-class operator of integrated destination resorts that deliver high-quality entertainment, gaming and

hospitality experiences.

Our mission is to create memorable experiences that engage, entertain, and inspire our guests through our diverse and talented people and our portfolio of

brands.  We champion the principles of corporate social responsibility while serving our guests, employees, communities and stakeholders worldwide.

The following are our strategic objectives:

·
·

·
·

Drive operational and capital structure improvements to enhance shareholder value;
Enhance our culture and approach to operations to better leverage investments in critical foundational competencies that support a high performance
organization;
Identify and execute on expansion and development opportunities in key domestic and international markets to grow global presence; and
Continue to solidify our reputation as a global leader in the practice of corporate social responsibility to sustain long-term shareholder value.

Reportable
Segments

We  have  two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments  within  the  regions  in  which  they  operate:  wholly  owned
domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently operate 12 wholly owned resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort
and casino (“MGM Macau”) and the development of an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau. We have additional business
activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”)
is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.  See “Resort Operations” below, as well as “Executive Overview” in Management’s
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  and  Note  16  in  the  accompanying  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  for
additional information related to our segments.

Resort
Operations

General

Our casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities.  We believe we own or invest in several of the
finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts
through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. Most of our revenue is cash-
based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards.  We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate
operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings.

We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. As discussed above, ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts
in  their  respective  markets  requires  capital  investments  to  maintain  the  best  possible  experiences  for  our  guests.  The  quality  of  our  resorts  and  amenities  can  be
measured  by  our  success  in  winning  numerous  awards,  both  domestic  and  globally,  including  several  Four  and  Five  Diamond  designations  from  the  American
Automobile Association as well as multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of

major conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming

1

customers, and the level o f play during major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year.  While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a
significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in o ur results.  In addition, our success in
marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers
from a specific country or region can affect our result s.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of the
year.  At our wholly owned domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us.  Other resort amenities may be owned and
operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties.  We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations
of restaurants and nightclubs.  We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is
not desirable or feasible.

Wholly
owned
domestic
resorts.
Over half of the net revenue from our wholly owned domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including
hotel,  food  and  beverage,  entertainment  and  other  non-gaming  amenities.  We  market  to  different  customers  and  utilize  our  significant  convention  and  meeting
facilities  to  allow  us  to  maximize  hotel  occupancy  and  customer  volumes  during  off-peak  times  such  as  mid-week  or  during  traditionally  slower  leisure  travel
periods, which also leads to better labor utilization.  Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the
price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering.  In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-

limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

MGM
China.
We  own  a  51%  controlling  interest  in  MGM  China  Holdings  Limited  (“MGM  China”),  which  owns  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  S.A.  (“MGM
Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession. We
believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is
the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and the development of an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in
Macau, discussed further below. Revenues at MGM Macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held
by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM
Grand  Paradise  gaming  subconcession  was  granted  by  Sociedade  de  Jogos  de  Macau,  S.A.,  and  expires  in  2020.    The  Macau  government  currently  prohibits
additional  concessions  and  subconcessions,  but  does  not  place  a  limit  on  the  number  of  casinos  or  gaming  areas  operated  by  the  concessionaires  and
subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations.

In October 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop a
resort and casino on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”).  The land concession contract became effective when the Macau
government published the agreement in the Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  Under the terms of the land concession
contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to build and open MGM Cotai by January 2018.

Construction of MGM Cotai commenced in 2013 and it is anticipated to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017. China State Construction Engineering
Corporation serves as the sole general contractor for the project.  MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500
gaming  tables  and  up  to  1,500  slots,  and  featuring  approximately  1,500  hotel  rooms.    The  actual  number  of  gaming  tables  allocated  to  MGM  Cotai  will  be
determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may be less than our 500 gaming table capacity.  The total estimated project budget is
$3.0 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

Customers
and
Competition

Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets
we operate in, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii.  Our gaming operations compete to a
lesser  extent  with  state-sponsored  lotteries,  off-track  wagering,  card  parlors,  online  gambling  and  other  forms  of  legalized  gaming  in  the  United  States  and
internationally.

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

·
·

·
·
·

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
Constructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premier
dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;
Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Wholly
owned
domestic
resorts.

Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group
customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings.  We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market
segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize
to drive business to our resorts during mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or
near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere
in the Las Vegas area.   Our Las Vegas Strip resorts also compete, in part, with each other.  According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there
were  approximately  149,200  and  150,500  guestrooms  in  Las  Vegas  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.    At  December  31,  2015,  we  operated
approximately  27%  of  the  guestrooms  in  Las  Vegas.    Las  Vegas  visitor  volume  was  42.3  million  in  2015,  a  2.9%  increase  from  the  41.1  million  reported  for
2014.  Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or constructing
new resorts in Las Vegas.  Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where
location is a critical factor to success.  In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. For
example,  in  Detroit,  Michigan  we  compete  with  a  casino  in  nearby  Windsor,  Canada  and  with  Native  American  casinos  in  Michigan.    In  Biloxi,  Mississippi  we
compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi and with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas.

MGM
China.

The three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot
machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally.  Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters
who offer VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary  hotel, food and beverage services.  Gaming promoters operate VIP
gaming rooms within the property.  In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling
chip turnover based commissions.  In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate.  These clientele are
acquired  through  our  direct  marketing  efforts.  Unlike  gaming  promoters  and  in-house  VIP  players,  main  floor  players  do  not  receive  commissions.    The  profit
contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming
floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future.  To target premium
main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals,
which include both table games and slots, to the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor
players.

Our  key  competitors  in  Macau  include  five  other  gaming  concessionaires  and  subconcessionaires.  If  the  Macau  government  were  to  grant  additional
concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.  Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from several concessionaires who have expansion plans announced or underway,
primarily on the Cotai Strip with several expected openings in 2016 and 2017.

We expect competition in the Macau market to continue to increase, as more capacity is brought online in the near future.  We also encounter competition
from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Las Vegas,
cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region.

Corporate
and
other.

 Much  like  our  wholly  owned  resorts,  our  unconsolidated  affiliates  compete  through  the  quality  of  amenities,  the  value  of  the
experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts.  Aria, which we manage and own 50% through CityCenter, appeals to the upper end of each segment in
the  Las  Vegas  market  and  competes  with  our  wholly  owned  casino  resorts  and  other  resorts  on  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.    Our  other  unconsolidated  affiliates  mainly
compete for customers against casino resorts in their respective markets.

Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs as discussed further below. We advertise on radio, television,
internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the
use of social media.  We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities.  A key element of marketing to premium
gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel.  Direct marketing is also important in the convention segment.  We maintain websites to inform
customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms, make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets.  We actively utilize several
social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals.

  M life, our customer loyalty program, is a broad-based program recognizing and rewarding customer spendi ng across
many  channels  focusing  on  wallet  share  capture  and  increased  loyalty  through  unique  and  exclusive  benefits  and  rewards.    M  life  provides  access  to  rewards,
privileges, and members-only events.  M life is a tiered program and allows customers to q ualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and
non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. Members may earn  points  and/or Express Comps for their gaming play
which can be redeeme d at restaurants, box offices or the M life front desk at participating properties.  Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating
machines . Members can utilize the M life website, www.mlife.com , to s ee offers, tier levels and point and Express Comps balances.

M life utilizes advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant
offers to members, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships. In addition to the loyalty program, we issue a company magazine - M
life Magazine - to highlight customers’ experiences and showcase “Moments” that members can redeem through the accumulation of Express Comps.

We also utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at our Las Vegas Strip resorts.  Our major Las Vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages
that include golf privileges at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas.  In connection with our marketing activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to play
Shadow Creek on a complimentary basis. Additionally, marketing efforts at Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi benefit from the Fallen Oak golf course located 20
minutes north of Beau Rivage.

MGM
China.
    MGM  Macau’s  loyalty  program  is  the  Golden  Lion  Club,  a  tiered  program  which  meets  the  needs  of  a  range  of  members  from  lower
spending leisure and entertainment customers through the highest level VIP cash players.  The structured rewards system based on member value and tiers ensures
that  customers  can  progressively  access  the  full  range  of  services  that  the  resort  provides.  The  program  is  aspirational  by  design  and  transparent  in  its  rewards,
encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.  In addition to the rewards offered to Golden Lion Club members, MGM Macau has developed dedicated
gaming and non-gaming areas to reflect different levels of rated play. Information from the Golden Lion Club is used to analyze customer usage by segment and
individual player profile.

In addition to the Golden Lion Club program, MGM Macau has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide
distinctive, high-end environments for the VIP players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the in-house VIP marketing team.  MGM Macau has
created a variety of incentive programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency.

Technology

We utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. We continue to
move forward on standardizing the technology platforms for several of our key operational systems. The standardization of these systems will afford us efficiencies
in operations and integration with future technology. These systems capture charges made by our customers during their stay, including allowing customers of our
resorts  to charge  meals  and services  at our other  local  resorts  to their  hotel  folio. Additionally,  we utilize  yield  management  programs  at our resorts  that help us
maximize occupancy and room rates.

We  continue  to  enhance  our  eCommerce  platform,  which  is  critical  to  our  digital  platforms  that  support  our  domestic  portfolio  of  casino  resorts.  Our
eCommerce platform provides our guests and business partners a premier digital experience where they have the ability to create an all-inclusive experience, from
accommodations to dining to shows with real time recommendations provided based on the guests’ shopping experience.  Available through our domestic resorts’
individual websites and our loyalty program website ( www.mlife.com ), the eCommerce platform gives guests the power to customize a complete itinerary from our
full portfolio of experiences, all in one place. In addition, this platform also provides our contact center agents in Las Vegas a unified and integrated customer service
application, allowing our agents to provide fast, efficient, and pertinent service to our guests.

Employees
and
Management

We  believe  that  knowledgeable,  friendly  and  dedicated  employees  are  a  key  success  factor  in  the  hospitality  industry.    Therefore,  we  invest  heavily  in
recruiting, training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible.  We have numerous
programs, both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives.  We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGM
Resorts University and various leadership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers.

5

Corporate
Social
Responsibility

We seek to conduct our business in an effective, socially responsible way while striving to maximize shareholder value.  Our corporate social responsibility

efforts are overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors.

Diversity
and
inclusion.
Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our Company’s value system, our people philosophy, our cultural life and therefore, our
competitive advantage as an employer and destination of choice for our global customer base.  Our diversity initiative at our resorts fosters employee engagement,
individual responsibility, team collaboration, leadership competency, high performance and innovation.  Our diversity initiative has been widely recognized for many
years and has been awarded numerous accolades.

Philanthropy
and
community
engagement.
    Our  host  community  and  social  investments  are  prioritized  to  strengthen  the  communities  where  our
employees  live,  work  and  care  for  their  families.    Our  community  platform  features  three  main  programs:  our  Corporate  Giving  Program,  our  employee-funded
MGM Resorts Foundation and our Employee Volunteer Program.  Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer service
and participate in civic and non-profit organizations and issues that advance the quality of life in our communities. Key investment areas include basic human needs,
diversity, public education, health and wellness and environmental sustainability.

Environmental
sustainability.
 We  continue  to  gain  recognition  for  our  comprehensive  environmental  responsibility  initiatives  in  energy  and  water
conservation,  recycling  and  waste  management,  sustainable  supply  chain  and  green  building.    Certain  of  our  casino  resorts  in  Nevada  and  our  casino  resort  in
Michigan were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations.  We received
certifications at all of our wholly owned domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay are the only casino resorts to
receive “Five Green Key” (the highest possible) ratings.  Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their
continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.

In addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency.
CityCenter (Aria, Vdara, Veer, Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, and The Shops at Crystals) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six
LEED ® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council, CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within
the large-scale hospitality industry.

At  MGM  Macau,  we  incorporate  the  same  commitment  to  environmental  preservation.    Our  efforts  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  indoor  air  quality,  and

environmental stewardship have resulted in MGM Macau receiving the Macau Environmental Protection Bureau – Macau Green Hotel Award.

The construction  of MGM National  Harbor and MGM Springfield  will further  position  MGM Resorts as a leader  in sustainable  resort  operations,  and by

adopting innovative technologies in the design and operating practices of these resorts, we are advancing our commitment to protecting the planet in new regions.

Development
and
Leveraging
Our
Brand
and
Management
Assets

In  allocating  resources,  our  financial  strategy  is  focused  on  managing  a  proper  mix  of  investing  in  existing  resorts,  spending  on  new  resorts  and  other
developments or initiatives and repaying long-term debt. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that
will provide profitable returns.

We  regularly  evaluate  possible  expansion  and  acquisition  opportunities  in  domestic  and  international  markets.  Opportunities  we  evaluate  may  include  the
ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. We
leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our
brands, particularly the “MGM Grand,” “Bellagio,” and “Skylofts” brands, are well suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may
undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

MGM
National
Harbor

The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission has awarded the Company’s subsidiary developing MGM National Harbor a license to build and
operate a destination casino resort in Prince George’s County at National Harbor, which is a waterfront development located on the Potomac River just outside of
Washington D.C. The expected cost to develop and construct MGM National Harbor is approximately $1.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and land-related
costs. The Company expects the resort to include a casino with approximately 3,600 slots and 160 table games including poker; a 300-room hotel with luxury spa
and rooftop

6

pool; 93,100 square feet of high ‑end branded retail and fine and casual dining; a 3,000-seat theater venue; 50,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a
4,700-space parking garage. MGM National Harbor is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2016.

MGM
Springfield

A subsidiary of the Company was awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be
developed  on  approximately  14  acres  of  land  in  downtown  Springfield,  Massachusetts.  The  Company’s  plans  for  the  resort  currently  include  a  casino  with
approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting
and  event  space;  and  a  3,375-space  parking  garage,  with  an  expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized
interest and land related costs. Construction of MGM Springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.

T-Mobile
Arena

In 2013, the Company formed Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC (the “Las Vegas Arena Company”) with a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.
(“AEG”) – a leader in sports, entertainment, and promotions – to design, construct, and operate an arena, located on a parcel of the Company’s land between Frank
Sinatra Drive and New York-New York, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. The Company and AEG each own 50% of Las Vegas Arena Company. Such development
is estimated to cost approximately $350 million, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs and is scheduled to open in April 2016.  The Las Vegas Arena
Company recently entered into a multi-year naming rights agreement with T-Mobile.  T-Mobile Arena will have a limited number of exclusive founding partners
which already include Coca-Cola, Cox Business, Toshiba American Business Solutions Inc. and Schneider Electric.  T-Mobile Arena will seat between 18,000 and
20,000  people  and  is  expected  to  host  world-class  events  –  from  UFC,  boxing,  hockey,  basketball  and  bull  riding  to  high-profile  awards  shows  and  top-name
concerts. Also, effective January 1, 2016, the Las Vegas Arena Company leases and operates the MGM Grand Garden Arena under a long term lease with an initial
15-year term, plus two 5-year renewal options.  See Note 6 and Note 11 for additional information related to Las Vegas Arena Company.

MGM
Hospitality

The Company has entered into management agreements for future non-gaming hotels, resorts and residential products in the Middle East, North Africa, India
and the United States. In 2014, the Company and the Hakkasan Group formed MGM Hakkasan Hospitality (“MGM Hakkasan”), owned 50% by each member, to
design,  develop  and  manage  luxury  non-gaming  hotels,  resorts  and  residences  under  certain  brands  licensed  from  the  Company  and  the  Hakkasan  Group.  Upon
formation, the Company contributed its management agreements for non-gaming hotels, resorts and residential projects (outside of the greater China region) under
development to MGM Hakkasan. In May 2015, the Company and the Hakkasan Group mutually agreed to terminate MGM Hakkasan and the brand license from
Hakkasan Group. The Company will continue to develop these projects under its brands through MGM Hospitality (a wholly owned subsidiary). Additionally, the
Company will continue to develop and manage properties in the greater China region with Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, including MGM Grand Sanya.

Formation
and
Proposed
Initial
Public
Offering
of
MGM
Growth
Properties,
LLC
(“
MGP”
)

On October 29, 2015, we announced the formation of MGP, a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to contribute the real estate associated with Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo,
Excalibur,  The  Park,  MGM  Grand  Detroit,  Beau  Rivage  and  Gold  Strike  Tunica  (collectively,  the  “Properties”)  to  a  newly  formed  operating  partnership  (the
“Operating  Partnership”),  which  MGP  will  control  through  a  general  partner  subsidiary.  We  also  intend  to  incur  approximately  $4  billion  of  debt  to  refinance  a
portion of the debt outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and senior notes, which refinancing debt would be assumed by the Operating Partnership in
connection with the REIT transaction. One of our subsidiaries will then lease the Properties from MGP for use under a long-term, “triple net” master lease agreement
with an initial 10-year term that includes four five-year extensions at our option. We will guarantee our subsidiary’s obligations under the master lease. We expect to
retain through subsidiaries an approximate 70% economic interest in the new Operating Partnership, as well as voting control of MGP through our ownership of a
controlling share in MGP.

We also announced that MGP had submitted a draft confidential registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) relating to its
proposed  initial  public  offering  (“IPO”)  of  shares,  the  proceeds  of  which  would  be  used  to  purchase  an  approximate  30%  economic  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  first  half  of  2016,  subject  to  regulatory  approvals,  including  receipt  of  approvals  from  gaming
regulators,  MGP’s  registration  statement  on  Form  S-11  being  declared  effective  by  the  SEC,  completion  of  the  related  financings  needed  to  fund  MGP,  general
market conditions and other customary conditions. MGP is expected to file the REIT election with its tax return for the calendar year ending December

7

31,  2016.  We  may,  at  any  time  and  for  any  reason  until  the  proposed  transaction  is  complete,  abandon  the  transaction  or  modify  or  change  the  terms  of  the
transaction.

Although the number of shares that will be sold to the public in connection with the proposed IPO has not been determined, we expect that we will continue to
consolidate  MGP’s  results  of  operations  with  our  business  for  accounting  purposes  upon  the  completion  of  the  proposed  IPO  and  for  so  long  as  we  retain  the
controlling  share  in  MGP.  The  minority  interest  that  we  do  not  own  following  the  completion  of  the  proposed  IPO  will  be  reflected  in  our  consolidated  balance
sheets  as  “non-controlling  interests”  and  such  interest’s  proportionate  share  of  MGP’s  net  income  or  losses  will  be  reflected  in  our  consolidated  statements  of
operations as “net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.” We have no current intention to dispose of our controlling share of MGP or our economic
interests in the operating partnership.

Intellectual
Property

Our  principal  intellectual  property  consists  of  trademarks  for,  among  others,  Bellagio,  The  Mirage,  Mandalay  Bay,  MGM,  MGM  Grand,  MGM  Resorts
International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus and Beau Rivage, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United
States.  In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in
the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these
brand  names  to  be  important  to  our  business  since  they  have  the  effect  of  developing  brand  identification.  We  believe  that  the  name  recognition,  reputation  and
image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and
periodically  renewed.  It  is  our  intent  to  pursue  and  maintain  our  trademark  registrations  consistent  with  our  goals  for  brand  development  and  identification,  and
enforcement of our trademark rights.

Employees
and
Labor
Relations

As  of  December  31,  2015,  we  had  approximately  44,600  full-time  and  14,900  part-time  employees  domestically,  of  which  6,100  and  2,300,  respectively,
support  the  Company’s  management  agreements  with  CityCenter.    In  addition,  we  had  approximately  5,900  employees  at  MGM  Macau.    We  had  collective
bargaining  contracts  with  unions  covering  approximately  29,900  of  our  employees  as  of  December  31,  2015.    In  November  2013,  Las  Vegas  union  employees
approved new collective bargaining agreements covering most of our Las Vegas union employees; these agreements expire in 2018.  Pursuant to the terms of the
Company’s labor agreements for its 10 Las Vegas properties, the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas (Culinary and Bartenders Unions) and the Company will
re-open  its  collective  bargaining  agreements.  The  purpose  of  these  discussions  includes  wage  negotiation,  the  funding  of  benefit  funds  for  the  remainder  of  the
contract term, and alternative business and financial models for operating food and beverage venues.  In December 2015, Detroit union employees, represented by
the  Detroit  Casino  Council,  approved  a  new  five-year  collective  bargaining  agreement.    Gold  Strike  Tunica  is  currently  engaged  in  bargaining  for  a  first  labor
contract  with  a  council  of  unions  representing  various  hotel  and  food  and  beverage  constituencies.    As  of  December  31,  2015,  none  of  the  employees  of  MGM
Macau are part of a labor union and the resort is not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulation
and
Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject
to  extensive  regulation  under  the  laws,  rules  and  regulations  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  it  is  located.    These  laws,  rules  and  regulations  generally  concern  the
responsibility,  financial  stability  and  character  of  the  owners,  managers,  and  persons  with  financial  interest  in  the  gaming  operations.  Violations  of  laws  in  one
jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A  more  detailed  description  of  the  gaming  regulations  to  which  we  are  subject  is  contained  in  Exhibit  99.2  to  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  which

Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our  businesses  are  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  in  general.    These  laws  and  regulations
include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building
codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to
access and use by disabled persons) , construction, land use and marketing and advertising.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are
subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new
laws and regulations could be enacted.  Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities
could adversely affect our operating results.

8

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environm ental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act,  the Resource  Conservation  Recovery  Act,  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and Liability  Act and  the  Oil Pollution  Act of  1990.
Under various fede ral,  state  and local  laws and regulations,  an owner or operator  of real property  may be held liable  for the  costs of removal  or remediation  of
certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the
presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on us or the results of our operatio ns.

This  Form  10-K  and  our  2015  Annual  Report  to  Stockholders  contain  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  the  U.S.  Private  Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“expects,”  “will,”  “may”  and  similar  references  to  future  periods.  Examples  of  forward-looking  statements  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  statements  we  make
regarding our ability and ultimate decision to complete the REIT transaction and related financing transactions, the anticipated terms of any such REIT transaction,
including  the  terms  of  the  master  lease,  and  the  realization  of  any  potential  advantages,  benefits  and  the  impact  of,  and  opportunities  created  by,  the  REIT
transaction; expected market growth in Macau; our ability to generate significant cash flow and execute on ongoing and future projects , such as the Profit Growth
Plan, and the expected results of the Profit Growth Plan;  amounts we will spend in capital expenditures and investments; the opening of strategic resort and other
developments and the estimated costs and expected components associated with those developments; and dividends and distributions we will receive from MGM
China or CityCenter . The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we make.

Forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  our  current  expectations  and  assumptions  regarding  our  business,  the  economy  and  other  future
conditions.  Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
predict.  Our  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  contemplated  by  the  forward-looking  statements.  They  are  neither  statements  of  historical  fact  nor
guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic,
business, competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to
satisfy our obligations;
current and future economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned
expenditures and investments as well as strategic initiatives such as the proposed REIT transaction ;

the fact that we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our Profit Growth Plan;
restrictions on our ability to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM
China;
the  ability  of  the  Macau  government  to  terminate  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  gaming  subconcession  under  certain  circumstances  without  compensating
MGM Grand Paradise or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession, which is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2020;
our ability to build and open our development in Cotai, which is expected to be completed at the end of the first quarter of 2017;

extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business;
the concentration of a majority of our major gaming resorts on the Las Vegas Strip;

the susceptibility of leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility,
and to disease epidemics;
the fact that co-investing in properties, including our investment in CityCenter, decreases our ability to manage risk;
the fact that future construction, development or expansion projects will be susceptible to substantial development and construction risks;
the fact that our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase

subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or other restrictions on our use or transfer of data;
increases in gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which we operate;
the fact that acquisitions, dispositions or other investments we may seek to pursue in the future may be unsuccessful; and
the potential for conflicts of interest to arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, which is now a publicly
traded company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-K or our 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by
law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-
looking statements.

You  should  also  be  aware  that  while  we  from  time  to  time  communicate  with  securities  analysts,  we  do  not  disclose  to  them  any  material  non-public
information, internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any

RISK
FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among
other things, the risks described below.

Risks
Relating
to
Our
Substantial
Indebtedness

·

·

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to
satisfy  our  obligations.    As  of  December  31,  2015,  we  had  approximately  $12.8  billion  principal  amount  of  indebtedness  outstanding,  including
$2.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity.  Any increase in the
interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our
other  liquidity  needs.    In  addition,  as  of  December  31,  2015,  MGM  China  had  approximately  $1.6  billion  of  debt  outstanding  under  its  credit
facility.  Furthermore, in January 2016, our subsidiary MGM National Harbor, LLC entered into a $525 million senior secured credit facility consisting
of  a  $425  million  delayed  draw  term  loan,  of  which  $250  million  was  funded  at  closing,  and  a  $100  million  revolver.  We  do  not  guarantee  MGM
China’s  or  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC’s  obligations  under  their  respective  credit  agreements  and,  to  the  extent  MGM  Macau  or  MGM  National
Harbor, LLC were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities is
limited by the covenants in our existing senior secured credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:

·
·
·
·
·

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds;
making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive.  For our owned and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest
significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished.  Such investment requires an ongoing supply of cash and, to the
extent that we cannot fund expenditures  from cash generated  by operations,  funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained.  Similarly,  development
projects, including the T-Mobile Arena project and our development projects in Massachusetts and Maryland, and acquisitions could require significant
capital  commitments,  the  incurrence  of additional  debt, guarantees  of third-party  debt,  or the incurrence  of contingent  liabilities,  any  or all  of which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Current
and
future
economic
and
credit
market
conditions
could
adversely
affect
our
ability
to
service
or
refinance
our
indebtedness
and
to
make
planned
expenditures
.  Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and
investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including
MGM China, borrow under our senior secured credit facility or incur new indebtedness.  If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate we
could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash
to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.  We cannot assure you that our business
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries, including MGM
China, that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness
or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that are
favorable to us.

We  have a  significant  amount  of indebtedness  maturing  in  2016, and  thereafter.   Our ability  to  timely  refinance  and  replace  our  indebtedness  in  the
future will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis,
we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments.  There is no
assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on
terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.

The
agreements
governing
our
senior
secured
credit
facility
and
other
senior
indebtedness
contain
restrictions
and
limitations
that
could
significantly
affect
our
ability
to
operate
our
business,
as
well
as
significantly
affect
our
liquidity,
and
therefore
could
adversely
affect
our
results
of
operations
.  Covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and cert ain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

·
·
·
·
·
·
·

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;
incur additional debt;
incur liens on assets;
sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
enter into transactions with affiliates;
allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and
enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our  ability  to  comply  with  these  provisions  may  be  affected  by  events  beyond  our  control.    The  breach  of  any  such  covenants  or  obligations  not
otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in
turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.  Any default under our senior secured credit facility or
the  indentures  governing  our  other  debt  could  adversely  affect  our  growth,  our  financial  condition,  our  results  of  operations  and  our  ability  to  make
payments on our debt.

In addition, MGM Grand Paradise and MGM China are co-borrowers under an amended and restated credit facility and MGM National Harbor, LLC is
the  borrower  under  a  senior  secured  credit  facility,  each  of  which  contains  covenants  that  restrict  their  ability  to  engage  in  certain  transactions.    In
particular, the MGM China credit facility and the MGM National Harbor, LLC senior secured credit facility require MGM China and MGM National
Harbor,  LLC,  as  applicable,  to  satisfy  various  financial  covenants,  including  a  maximum  consolidated  total  leverage  ratio  and  minimum  interest
coverage ratio. These agreements also impose certain operating and financial restrictions on MGM China and MGM National Harbor, LLC, and each of
their  subsidiaries  (including,  with  respect  to  MGM  China,  MGM  Grand  Paradise),  including,  among  other  things,  limitations  on  their  ability  to  pay
dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or
transfer or sell assets.

Risks
Related
to
our
Business

·

There
are
risks
associated
with
our
proposed
REIT
transaction.
 On October 29, 2015, we announced the formation of MGP and our intention that it
elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. Federal income tax purposes following the proposed contribution of certain of our properties and related debt and
equity financing transactions, including the IPO of MGP shares as reflected in a draft confidential registration statement filed with the SEC. Following
the completion of the IPO and the filing of its election to be taxed as a REIT, MGP would be a publicly traded, controlled REIT primarily engaged in
owning,  acquiring  and  leasing  large-scale  casino  resort  properties,  which  include  casino  gaming,  hotel,  convention,  dining,  entertainment,  retail  and
mixed-use facilities, and other resort amenities.

The completion of the proposed REIT transaction and IPO is subject to numerous conditions and the finalization of terms relating to the transactions,
which are subject to a number of variables, including changes in market conditions, and may not occur on favorable terms or at all. We have not yet
determined the number of shares that will be sold in the proposed IPO or the valuation of such shares. Therefore, the amount of cash we expect to raise
in connection with the proposed IPO and related transactions, and the degree to which we are able to reduce our indebtedness, is uncertain.

In connection with the proposed REIT transaction and IPO:

·

·

·

·

our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to developments relating to the proposed REIT transaction and IPO or other
action or market speculation regarding the proposed REIT transaction and IPO;
we will incur  substantial  increases  in general  and administrative  expense  associated  with the need to retain  and compensate  third-
party consultants and advisors (including legal counsel);
although  we  have  no  plan  or  intention  of  disposing  of  our  interest  in  MGP  and  the  operating  partnership  following  the  proposed
transactions,  to  the  extent  that  future  dispositions  result  in  our  owning  less  than  a  controlling  interest  in  MGP,  MGP’s  financial
results may no longer be consolidated with our financial results, which may materially and adversely affect our consolidated results
of operations; and
we may not complete the proposed REIT transaction and IPO, in which event we will have incurred significant expenses that we will
be unable to recover, and for which we will not receive any benefit. If the

13

proposed IPO is completed, MGP would be a new publicly traded company. We cannot make any assurances that the proposed IPO,
if completed, will increase our market value. In addition, the IPO and related transactions are subject to customa ry approvals and
other risks, many of which are outside our control, including changes in legislation and tax rules.

We
face
significant
competition
with
respect
to
destination
travel
locations
generally
and
with
respect
to
our
peers
in
the
industries
in
which
we
compete,
and
failure
to
compete
effectively
could
materially
adversely
affect
our
business,
financial
condition,
results
of
operations
and
cash
flow
.  The
hotel, resort and casino industries are highly competitive.  We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel,
resort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers.  To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room
capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase.  Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also
expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas and Macau, all
of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has increased the competition faced
by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere.

In  addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of  new  gaming
establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California.  For example, while our Macau operations compete
to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near Asia (including Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and
unlicensed gaming operations), certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines
and  Russia)  and  others  (such  as  Japan,  Taiwan  and  Thailand)  may  legalize  casino  gaming  (or  online  gaming)  in  the  future.    Furthermore,  currently
MGM  Grand  Paradise  holds  one  of  only  six  gaming  concessions  authorized  by  the  Macau  government  to  operate  casinos  in  Macau.    If  the  Macau
government  were  to  allow  additional  competitors  to  operate  in  Macau  through  the  grant  of  additional  concessions  or  if  current  concessionaires  and
subconcessionaires open additional facilities (for example, the facilities currently being developed in Cotai, Macau are expected to increase total hotel
room inventory by 30% and significantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in Macau), we would face increased competition.

Most  jurisdictions  where  casino  gaming  is  currently  permitted  place  numerical  and/or  geographical  limitations  on  the  issuance  of  new  gaming
licenses.  Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some
cases  new  gaming  operations  may  be  restricted  to  specific  locations  and  we  expect  that  there  will  be  intense  competition  for  any  attractive  new
opportunities  (which  may  include  acquisitions  of  existing  properties)  that  do  arise.    Furthermore,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  Nevada  and  New
Jersey, have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions have legalized video gaming terminals.  The expansion of online gaming and
other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino
resorts.

In  addition  to  competition  with  other  hotels,  resorts  and  casinos,  we  compete  with  destination  travel  locations  outside  of  the  markets  in  which  we
operate.  Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Our
businesses
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
and
the
cost
of
compliance
or
failure
to
comply
with
such
regulations
may
adversely
affect
our
business
and
results
of
operations
.   Our  ownership  and  operation  of  gaming  facilities  is  subject  to  extensive  regulation  by  the  countries,  states  and
provinces in which we operate.  These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,
financial  stability  and  character  of  the  owners  and  managers  of  gaming  operations  as  well  as  persons  financially  interested  or  involved  in  gaming
operations.    As  such,  our  gaming  regulators  can  require  us  to  disassociate  ourselves  from  suppliers  or  business  partners  found  unsuitable  by  the
regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction.  In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign
unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions.  The
regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.  In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time by various federal, state, local and
foreign legislatures and officials.  Increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our results.  For a summary of gaming and other regulations
that affect our business, see “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Further,  our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  and  investors  in  our  properties  must  meet  approval  standards  of  certain  state  and  foreign  regulatory
authorities.  If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we

14

would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property.  State
regulatory  agencies  may  conduct  investigations  into  the  conduct  or  associations  of  our  directors,  officers,  key  employees  or  investors  to  ensure
compliance  with  applicable  standards.    Certain  public  and  private  issuances  of  securities  and  other  transactions  also  require  the  approval  of  certain
regulatory authorities.

In Macau, current laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on
the interpretation of these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the
future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau are
subject  to  administrative  review  and  approval  by  various  government  agencies.    We  cannot  assure  you  that  MGM  China  will  be  able  to  obtain  all
necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations.  Macau laws permit redress to
the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

In  addition  to  gaming  regulations,  we  are  also  subject  to  various  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  laws  and  regulations  affecting  businesses  in
general.  These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters,
smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.  For instance, we are subject to certain
federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Under various federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
certain  hazardous  or  toxic  substances  or  wastes  located  on  its  property,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  present  owner  or  operator  knows  of,  or  is
responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes.  Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or
new laws and regulations could be enacted.  For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants,
work places, schools and casinos. Similarly, in October 2014, casinos in Macau, including MGM China, implemented a smoking ban which prohibits
smoking on all mass market gaming floors and, in 2015, the Macau Health Bureau announced that they will promote the submission of a bill proposing
a full smoking ban in casinos, including in VIP rooms. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the
future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-
money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970,
commonly known as the "Bank Secrecy Act", which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") any currency
transactions  in  excess  of  $10,000  that  occur  within  a  24-hour  gaming  day,  including  identification  of  the  individual(s)  involved  in  the  currency
transaction.  We  are  also  required  to  report  certain  suspicious  activity  where  we  know,  suspect  or  have  reason  to  suspect  transactions,  among  other
things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful
purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention.
Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be
interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank
Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our
business
is
affected
by
economic
and
market
conditions
in
the
markets
in
which
we
operate
and
in
the
locations
in
which
our
customers
reside
.    Our  business  is  particularly  sensitive  to  reductions  in  discretionary  consumer  spending  and  corporate  spending  on  conventions,  trade  shows  and
business  development.    Economic  contraction,  economic  uncertainty  or  the  perception  by our  customers  of  weak  or  weakening  economic  conditions
may  cause  a  decline  in  demand  for  hotels,  casino  resorts,  trade  shows  and  conventions,  and  for  the  type  of  luxury  amenities  we  offer.    In  addition,
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job
market,  perceived  or  actual  disposable  consumer  income  and  wealth,  outbreaks  of  contagious  diseases  or  fears  of  war  and  future  acts  of
terrorism.  Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including as a result of demographic changes, which, for instance,
has resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of
consumers  and  react  to  these  trends  and  any  failure  to  do  so  may  negatively  impact  our  results  of  operations.    Aria,  Bellagio  and  MGM  Grand  Las
Vegas in particular may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the
United States, and California in particular.  A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant

15

economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect
our op erating  results.    For  example,  the  prior  recession  and  downturn  in  consumer  and  corporate  spending  had  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of
operations.

In addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau from mainland China, general economic and market conditions
in China could impact our financial prospects.  Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currency
movements, including market impacts resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank
lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals), could disrupt the number of visitors
from  mainland  China  to  MGM  Macau  and/or  the  amounts  they  are  willing  to  spend  in  the  casino.    For  example,  from  2008  through  2010,  China
readjusted  its  visa  policy  toward  Macau  and  limited  the  number  of  visits  that  some  mainland  Chinese  citizens  may  make  to  Macau  in  a  given  time
period.  In addition, effective October 2013, China banned “zero‑fare” tour groups involving no or low up-front payments and compulsory shopping,
which were popular among visitors to Macau from mainland China and in December 2014 the Chinese government tightened the enforcement of visa
transit rules for those seeking to enter Macau at the Gongbei border (including requirements to present an airplane ticket to a destination country, a visa
issued by such destination country and a valid Chinese passport). It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become
more restrictive, or be readopted in the future.  These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have,
the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.

Furthermore,  our  operations  in  Macau  may  be  impacted  by  competition  for  limited  labor  resources.    Our  success  in  Macau  will  be  impacted  by  our
ability to retain and hire employees.  We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such
competition will grow in light of new developments in Macau.  While we seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort, certain
Macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire
Macau residents as dealers in our casinos).  In addition, limitations on the number of gaming tables permitted by the Macau government could impact
our  current  expectation  on  the  number  of  table  games  we  will  be  able  to  utilize  at  our  Cotai  project.    Such  limitations  or  reduction  in  table  game
availability may impact MGM China’s results of operations. Finally, because additional casino projects are under construction and are to be developed
in the future, existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau.  If transportation facilities
to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability  of Macau as a
gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our development in Cotai, Macau, could be negatively impacted.

We
may
not
realize
all
of
the
anticipated
benefits
of
our
Profit
Growth
Plan.
 We  have  undertaken  an  initiative  for  sustained  growth  and  margin
enhancement, focused on improving our business processes to optimize scale for greater efficiency and lower costs throughout our business. While we
believe  these  initiatives  will  result  in  approximately  $300 million  of  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  benefit  by  2017,  our  optimization  efforts  may  fail  to
achieve expected results. Our Profit Growth Plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual
Adjusted EBITDA benefit may differ materially from what we anticipate.

We
have
agreed
not
to
have
any
interest
or
involvement
in
gaming
businesses
in
China,
Macau,
Hong
Kong
and
Taiwan,
other
than
through
MGM
China
.  In connection with the initial public offering of MGM China, the holding company that indirectly owns and operates MGM Macau, we entered
into  a  Deed  of  Non-Compete  Undertakings  with  MGM  China  and  Ms.  Ho,  Pansy  Catilina  Chiu  King  (“Ms.  Pansy  Ho”)  pursuant  to  which  we  are
restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than
through MGM China.  While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in
these  locations  could  be limited  until  the  earliest  of  (i)  March  31, 2020, (ii)  the  date  MGM China’s  ordinary  shares  cease  to  be listed  on The  Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or (iii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then issued share capital of MGM
China.

The
Macau
government
can
terminate
MGM
Grand
Paradise’s
subconcession
 under
certain
circumstances
without
compensating
MGM
Grand
Paradise
, the
Macau
government
can
exercise
its
redemption
right
with
respect
to
the
subconcession
in
2017
or
the
Macau
government
can
refuse
to
grant
MGM

an

of

subcon
cession

, any
of
which
would
have
a
material
adverse
effect
on
our
business
, financial
condition
, results
of
operations
and
cash
flows
 .    The  Macau  government  has  the  right  to  unilaterally  terminate  the  subconcession  in  the  event  of
fundamental  non-c  ompliance  by  MGM  Grand  Paradise  with  applicable  Macau  laws  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  basic  obligations  under  the
subconcession contract.  MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subc
oncession  contract  within  a  period  to  be  stipulated  by  the  Macau  government.    Upon  such  termination,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  area
premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensati on to MGM Grand Paradise,
and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations.  We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations
under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.

Furthermore, under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government
might promulgate in the future.  We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these
laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses.  If any disagreement arises between MGM
Grand  Paradise  and  the  Macau  government  regarding  the  interpretation  of,  or  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  compliance  with,  a  provision  of  the
subconcession  contract,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  will  be  relying  on  a  consultation  and  negotiation  process  with  the  Macau  government.    During  any
consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau
government.  Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon
the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above.  The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in
Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition,  the  subconcession  contract  expires on March  31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession  is extended,  or legislation  with regard  to reversion  of
casino  premises  is  amended,  all  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  casino  premises  and  gaming-related  equipment  will  automatically  be  transferred  to  the
Macau government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations.  Beginning on
April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice.  In the event the Macau
government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity.  The amount of such compensation or
indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention
and  exhibition  facilities,  during  the  taxable  year  prior  to  the  redemption,  before  deducting  interest,  depreciation  and  amortization,  multiplied  by  the
number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession.  We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend the
subconcession  contract  on terms  favorable  to MGM Grand  Paradise  or at  all.   We  also cannot  assure  you that  if  the subconcession  is  redeemed,  the
compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.

We
are
required
to
build
and
open
our
development
in
Cotai,
Macau
by
January
2018.

If
we
are
unable
to
meet
this
deadline,
and
the
deadline
for
the
development
is
not
extended,
we
may
lose
the
land
concession,
which
would
prohibit
us
from
operating
any
facilities
developed
under
such
land
concession
.  The land concession for the approximately 18 acre site on Cotai, Macau was officially gazetted on January 9, 2013.  If we are unable to
build and open our proposed resort and casino by January 2018, and the deadline is not extended, the Macau government has the right to unilaterally
terminate the land concession contract.  A loss of the land concession could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
is
dependent
upon
gaming
promoters
for
a
significant
portion
of
gaming
revenues
in
Macau
. Gaming promoters, who promote
gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau.  With
the rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated
by  licensed  gaming  promoters,  the  competition  for  relationships  with  gaming  promoters  has  increased.    While  MGM  Grand  Paradise  is  undertaking
initiatives  to  strengthen  relationships  with  gaming  promoters,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  it  will  be  able  to  maintain,  or  grow,  relationships  with
gaming  promoters.    In  addition,  continued  reductions  in,  and  new  regulations  governing,  the  gaming  promoter  segment  may  result  in  the  closure  of
additional VIP rooms in Macau, including VIP rooms at MGM Macau. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming
promoters,  or  if  gaming  promoters  are  unable  to  develop  or  maintain  relationships  with  our  high-end  customers  (or  if,  as  a  result  of  recent  market
conditions  in  Macau,  gaming  promoters  encounter  difficulties  attracting  patrons  to  come  to  Macau),  MGM Grand  Paradise’s  ability  to  grow gaming
revenues will be hampered.  Furthermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau are closed there can be no

17

assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at
all.

In addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance
with gaming licenses.  While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming
promoters with whom MGM Grand Paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon.  If a gaming promoter falls below
MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  standards,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  or  we  may  suffer  reputational  harm  or  possibly  sanctions  from  gaming  regulators  with
authority over our operations.

We also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the
recoverability of these loans.

The
future
recognition
of
our
foreign
tax
credit
deferred
tax
asset
is
uncertain,
and
the
amount
of
valuation
allowance
we
may
apply
against
such
deferred
tax
asset
may
change
materially
in
future
periods
based
on
changes
to
the
underlying
forecasts
of
future
profitability
of
and
distributions
from
MGM
China,
changes
in
our
assumption
concerning
renewals
of
the
five-year
exemption
from
Macau’s
12%
complementary
tax
on
gaming
profits
and
changes
in
assumptions
concerning
future
U.S.
operating
profits
.
We currently have significant foreign tax credit deferred tax assets resulting from tax
credit carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred
tax  asset  for  recoverability  and  record  a  valuation  allowance  to  the  extent  that  we  determine  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  such  asset  will  be
recovered.  This evaluation is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of and distributions from MGM China, as
well  as  our  assumption  concerning  renewals  of  the  five-year  exemption  from  Macau’s  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits.  As  a  result,
significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions may have a
material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance.  For example, should we in a future period actually receive or be able to assume an additional
five-year exemption, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit deferred tax
asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  In addition, a change to our forecasts
of  future  profitability  of  and  distributions  from  MGM  China  could  also  result  in  a  material  change  in  the  valuation  allowance  with  a  corresponding
impact on the provision for income taxes in such period.

Finally, while we do not currently rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our recent history
of cumulative losses in the U.S., if the recent improvement in U.S. operating results continues, we could in a future period begin to rely on future U.S.
source operating income for such purpose which could result in a reduction in the valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction in the provision
for income taxes in such period.

Extreme
weather
conditions
or
climate
change
may
cause
property
damage
or
interrupt
business,
which
could
harm
our
business
and
results
of
operations
.    Certain  of  our  casino  properties  are  located  in  areas  that  may  be  subject  to  extreme  weather  conditions,  including,  but  not  limited  to,
hurricanes in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau.  Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,
and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas.  In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other
cause of water shortage.  A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely
affect  our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Although  we  maintain  both  property  and  business  interruption  insurance  coverage  for  certain  extreme
weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business
interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme
weather conditions.  Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our
affected  properties  to  decrease  for  an  indefinite  period,  which  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and cash flows.

Because
a
majority
of
our
major
gaming
resorts
are
concentrated
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip,
we
are
subject
to
greater
risks
than
a
gaming
company
that
is
more
geographically
diversified
.  Given that a majority of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly
affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry.  For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that
disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business.  We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas,
but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors.  Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand
can impact the number of visitors to our resorts.  Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway

·

·

·

18

·

·

·

·

between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside.  Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic
disruptions may also affect the numb er of customers who visit our facilities.

We
extend
credit
to
a
large
portion
of
our
customers
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
collect
gaming
receivables
 .  We conduct a portion of our gaming
activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments.  Table games players typically are issued more markers
than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts.  High-end gaming is more
volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact
on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.  Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.  We issue markers to those customers whose level
of  play  and  financial  resources  warrant,  in  the  opinion  of  management,  an  extension  of  credit.    In  addition,  MGM  Grand  Paradise  extends  credit  to
certain  gaming  promoters  and those promoters  can extend credit  to their  customers.   Uncollectible  receivables  from  high-end customers  and gaming
promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

While gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on
gaming  debts  are  enforceable  in  all  states  under  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  other  jurisdictions  may  determine  that
enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy.  Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the
U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of
many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM Macau will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau.  To the
extent MGM Macau gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM Macau may not have access to a forum in which it
will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM
Macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts.  Moreover, under applicable law, MGM Macau remains obligated to pay taxes on
uncollectible winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible.  Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on
our operating results.

We
may
incur
impairments
to
goodwill,
indefinite-lived
intangible
assets,
or
long-lived
assets
which
could
negatively
affect
our
future
profits
 .  We
review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative
guidance.  Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have
resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or
write-downs may be required in future periods. For instance, in 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion to reduce the historical
carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this
could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Leisure
and
business
travel
, especially
travel
by
air
, are
particularly
susceptible
to
global
geopolitical
events
, such
as
terrorist
attacks
or
acts
of
war
or
hostility
.  We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air.  Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and
Macau  properties,  any  terrorist  act,  outbreak  of  hostilities,  escalation  of  war,  or  any  actual  or  perceived  threat  to  the  security  of  travel  by  air  could
adversely  affect our financial  condition,  results  of operations  and cash flows.  Furthermore,  although we have been able to purchase some insurance
coverage  for  certain  types  of  terrorist  acts,  insurance  coverage  against  loss  or  business  interruption  resulting  from  war  and  some  forms  of  terrorism
continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing
in
our
properties,
including
our
investment
in
CityCenter,
decreases
our
ability
to
manage
risk
.  In addition to acquiring or developing
hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest,
as a co-investor.  Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property.  Therefore, the operation of such properties is subject to
inherent  risk  due  to  the  shared  nature  of  the  enterprise  and  the  need  to  reach  agreements  on  material  matters.    In  addition,  investments  with  other
investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations,
or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our
instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.  Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject hotels and resorts owned by such
entities to additional risk.  Further,

19

we may be unable to take action with out the approval of our co-investors.  Alternatively, our co-investors could take actions binding on the property
without our consent.  Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business
and its ability to meet its obligations.  If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future
funding requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us.  In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’s
indebtedness subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur
additional  indebtedness,  place  liens  upon  assets,  make  distributions  to  us,  make  certain  investments,  consummate  certain  asset  sales,  enter  into
transactions with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
all  or  substantially  all  of  its  assets.    The  CityCenter  third  amended  and  restated  credit  facility  also  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that  require
CityCenter  to  maintain  a  maximum  total  leverage  ratio  (as  defined  in  CityCenter’s  third  amended  and  restated  credit  facility)  for  each  quarter.    We
cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

Any
of
our
future
construction,
development
or
expansion
projects
will
be
subject
to
significant
development
and
construction
risks,
which
could
have
a
material
adverse
impact
on
related
project
timetables,
costs
and
our
ability
to
complete
the
projects
.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including:

·
·
·
·
·
·

·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
changes to plans and specifications;
engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;
delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
changes  in  laws  and  regulations,  or  in  the  interpretation  and  enforcement  of  laws  and  regulations,  applicable  to  gaming,  leisure,
residential, real estate development or construction projects;
labor disputes or work stoppages;
disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
personal injuries to workers and other persons;
environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
weather interferences or delays;
fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

The  occurrence  of  any  of  these  development  and  construction  risks  could  increase  the  total  costs,  delay  or  prevent  the  construction,  development,
expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake.  For instance, we currently expect the
total  development  costs  of  our  Cotai  project  to  be  approximately  $3.0  billion,  excluding  development  fees  eliminated  in  consolidation,  capitalized
interest and land-related costs.  We currently expect total development costs of our Maryland project to be approximately $1.3 billion, total development
costs of our Massachusetts project to be approximately $865 million and total development costs of our T-Mobile Arena project to be approximately
$350  million,  each  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land  related  costs.    While  we  believe  that  the  overall  budgets  for  these  developments  are
reasonable,  these  development  costs  are  estimates  and  the  actual  development  costs  may  be  higher  than  expected.    We  cannot  guarantee  that  our
construction costs or total project costs for future projects, including our developments in Cotai, Maryland and Massachusetts, will not increase beyond
amounts initially budgeted or that the expected design and features of current or future projects will not change. In addition, the regulatory approvals
associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet
those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction or incur
payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our
insurance
coverage
may
not
be
adequate
to
cover
all
possible
losses
that
our
properties
could
suffer.

In
addition,
our
insurance
costs
may
increase
and
we
may
not
be
able
to
obtain
similar
insurance
coverage
in
the
future
.  Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating
properties,  which  covers  damage  caused  by  a  casualty  loss  (such  as  fire,  natural  disasters,  acts  of  war,  or  terrorism),  each  policy  has  certain
exclusions.  In addition, our property insurance

20

coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the f acilities if there was a total loss.  Our level
of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor
strikes; nuclear events; acts of war; loss of income d ue to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism; loss of electrical
power due to catastrophic events,  rolling blackouts or otherwise; deterioration or corrosion; insect or animal damage; and pollution, may not be covered
at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In  addition  to  the  damage  caused  to  our  properties  by  a  casualty  loss,  we  may  suffer  business  disruption  as  a  result  of  these  events  or  be  subject  to
claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed.  While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance
may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event.

We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may
need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any
failure
to
protect
our
trademarks
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
value
of
our
brand
names
and
adversely
affect
our
business
 .    The
development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our
success.    While  our  business  as  a  whole  is  not  substantially  dependent  on  any  one  trademark  or  combination  of  several  of  our  trademarks  or  other
intellectual  property,  we  seek  to  establish  and  maintain  our  proprietary  rights  in  our  business  operations  through  the  use  of  trademarks.    We  file
applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate.  Despite
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable.  The laws of some
foreign  countries  do  not  protect  proprietary  rights  to  as  great  an  extent  as  the  laws  of  the  United  States.    Monitoring  the  unauthorized  use  of  our
intellectual property is difficult.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others.  Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps
we  have  taken  to  protect  our  trademarks  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  countries  will  be  adequate  to  prevent  imitation  of  our  trademarks  by
others.    The  unauthorized  use  or  reproduction  of  our  trademarks  could  diminish  the  value  of  our  brand  and  its  market  acceptance,  competitive
advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

Tracinda
owns
a
significant
amount
of
our
common
stock
and
may
be
able
to
exert
significant
influence
over
matters
requiring
stockholder
approval
.  As of December 31, 2015, Tracinda Corporation beneficially owned approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock and as a result, Tracinda
may  be  able  to  exercise  significant  influence  over  any  matter  requiring  stockholder  approval,  including  the  approval  of  significant  corporate
transactions.  Upon  Mr.  Kerkorian’s  passing,  Tracinda’s  position  in  our  common  stock  became  subject  to  the  terms  of  Mr.  Kerkorian’s  last  will  and
testament, which provides for an orderly disposition of Tracinda’s position in our common stock. As a result, while we expect that Tracinda’s ownership
of our common stock will decline in the future, Tracinda has not indicated when, if or how it intends to sell its position in our common stock.

We
are
subject
to
risks
associated
with
doing
business
outside
of
the
United
States
. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that
are  inherent  in  conducting  business  under  non-United  States  laws,  regulations  and  customs.    In  particular,  the  risks  associated  with  the  operation  of
MGM Macau or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

·

·

·

·
·
·

·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
changes in non-United States government programs;
possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;
difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;
different labor regulations;
changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
outbreaks of diseases or epidemics;
potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

21

·

·

·

·

·

We  are  also  exposed  to  a  variety  of  market  risks,  including  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.    If  the  United  States  dollar
strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is dominated in the
currencies of other such countries will decrease.

Any
violation
of
the
Foreign
Corrupt
Practices
Act
or
any
other
similar
anti-corruption
laws
could
have
a
negative
impact
on
us
.  A significant portion
of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-
border  business  and  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  we  transact  business.    We  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  United  States  Foreign  Corrupt
Practices  Act  (“FCPA”)  and  other  similar  anti-corruption  laws,  which  generally  prohibit  companies  and  their  intermediaries  from  making  improper
payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  While our employees and agents are required to comply
with  these  laws,  we  cannot  be  sure  that  our  internal  policies  and  procedures  will  always  protect  us  from  violations  of  these  laws,  despite  our
commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics.  Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and
civil  sanctions  as  well  as  other  penalties  against  us,  and  the  SEC  and  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  continue  to  vigorously  pursue  enforcement  of  the
FCPA.  The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We
face
risks
related
to
pending
claims
that
have
been
, or
future
claims
that
may
be
, brought
against
us
.  Claims have been brought against us and our
subsidiaries  in  various  legal  proceedings,  and  additional  legal  and  tax  claims  arise  from  time  to  time.    We  may  not  be  successful  in  the  defense  or
prosecution  of  our  current  or  future  legal  proceedings,  which  could  result  in  settlements  or  damages  that  could  significantly  impact  our  business,
financial condition and results of operations.  Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

A
significant
portion
of
our
labor
force
is
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
.  Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively
affect our business and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29,900 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements.    A  prolonged  dispute  with  the  covered  employees  or  any  labor  unrest,  strikes  or  other  business  interruptions  in  connection  with  labor
negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations.  Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could
further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may
be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  In addition, to the extent that our non-union employees join unions,
we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems.

Our
business
is
particularly
sensitive
to
energy
prices
and
a
rise
in
energy
prices
could
harm
our
operating
results
 . We  are  a  large  consumer  of
electricity  and  other  energy  and,  therefore,  higher  energy  prices  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.    Accordingly,  increases  in
energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results.  Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may
result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

The
failure
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
computer
systems
and
internal
customer
information
could
result
in
damage
of
reputation
and/or
subject
us
to
fines
, payment
of
damages
, lawsuits
or
restrictions
on
our
use
or
transfer
of
data
.  We collect and store information relating to our employees and
guests for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy
laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world.  Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may
be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.

Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties
and services to our guests.  In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third
parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data
may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on
proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer
and  employee  information,  such  as  payment  card  and  other  confidential  or  proprietary  information.  Our  data  security  measures  are  reviewed  and
evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. In addition, while we maintain cyber
risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient .

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses.  Disruptions in the availability
of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to

22

service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations.  For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security
attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed.  Our information
systems and records, inc luding those we maintain with our third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future.  In
addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do no t directly control any of
such parties’ information security operations.   A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-
party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations and management team, and result in
remediation  expenses,  regulatory  penalties  and  litigation  by customers  and other  parties  whose information  was subject  to  such attacks,  all  of  which
could have a material adverse eff ect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We
may
seek
to
expand
through
investments
in
other
businesses
and
properties
or
through
alliances
or
acquisitions,
and
we
may
also
seek
to
divest
some
of
our
properties
and
other
assets,
any
of
which
may
be
unsuccessful
 .    We  intend  to  consider  strategic  and  complementary  acquisitions  and
investments  in  other  businesses,  properties  or  other  assets.    Furthermore,  we  may  pursue  any  of  these  opportunities  in  alliance  with  third
parties.  Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business,
including risks related to:

·
·
·
·
·
·

spending cash and incurring debt;
assuming contingent liabilities;
unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
retaining key employees; and
consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will
actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances.

If
the
jurisdictions
in
which
we
operate
increase
gaming
taxes
and
fees
 , our
results
could
be
adversely
affected
 . State and local authorities raise a
significant  amount  of  revenue  through  taxes  and  fees  on  gaming  activities.    From  time  to  time,  legislators  and  government  officials  have  proposed
changes  in  tax  laws,  or  in  the  administration  of  such  laws,  affecting  the  gaming  industry.    Periods  of  economic  downturn  or  uncertainty  and  budget
deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes.  If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming
taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely  affected.    For  instance,  income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise  currently  has  the  benefit  of  a  corporate  tax
exemption  in  Macau,  which  exempts  us  from  paying  the  12%  complementary  tax  on  profits  generated  by  the  operation  of  casino  games.    This
exemption is effective through the end of 2016 and while we believe that we will be granted additional five-year exemptions in the future we cannot
assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted.

Conflicts

MGM

.  As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock, MGM China now
has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM
China  may  have  conflicting  fiduciary  obligations  to  our  stockholders  and  to  the  minority  stockholders  of  MGM  China.    Decisions  that  could  have
different implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM
China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

MGM
China

MGM  Macau  occupies  an  approximately  10  acre  site  and  the  MGM  Cotai  development  will  occupy  an  approximately  18  acre  site,  both  of  which  are
possessed under separate 25-year land use right agreements with the Macau government.   The MGM China credit facility is secured by MGM Grand Paradise’s
interest in the Cotai and MGM Macau land use rights, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in
substantially  all  of  their  assets  to  secure  the  facility.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  approximately  $1.6  billion  was  outstanding  under  the  MGM  China  credit
facility.  These borrowings are non-recourse to MGM Resorts International.

MGM
National
Harbor

MGM  National  Harbor  occupies  approximately  23  acres  of  leased  land  in  Prince  George’s  County,  Maryland.    In  January  2016,  MGM  National  Harbor,
LLC,  the  Company’s  wholly  owned  subsidiary  developing  and  constructing  MGM  National  Harbor,  entered  into  a  $525  million  senior  secured  credit  facility

for the term loan B (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and
term loan B facilities).  As of December 31, 2015, term loan A was $120 million and term loan B was $80 million. See Note 11 for discussion of the Company’s
repayment guarantee related to the T-Mobile Arena.

Except as described above with respect to the Las Vegas Arena Company senior secured credit facility, all of the borrowings by our unconsolidated affiliates

described above are non-recourse to MGM Resorts International.

Other than as described above, none of our properties serve as collateral.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

Securities
and
derivative
litigation.
 In 2009 various shareholders filed six lawsuits in Nevada federal and state court against the Company and various of its
former and current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws violations and/or related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with statements allegedly
made by the defendants during the period August 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings in 2009 (the “class period”). In general, the lawsuits asserted the same
or similar allegations, including that during the relevant period defendants artificially inflated the Company’s common stock price by knowingly making materially
false  and  misleading  statements  and  omissions  to  the  investing  public  about  the  Company’s  financial  statements  and  condition,  operations,  CityCenter,  and  the
intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock; that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled certain Company insiders to derive personal profit
from the sale of Company common stock to the public; that defendants caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase Company common stock at artificially
inflated  prices;  and  that  defendants  imprudently  implemented  a  share  repurchase  program  to  the  detriment  of  the  Company.  The  lawsuits  sought  unspecified
compensatory damages, restitution and disgorgement of alleged profits and/or attorneys’ fees and costs in amounts to be proven at trial, as well as injunctive relief
related to corporate governance.

The state and federal court derivative actions were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motions. Only two of these lawsuits remain pending. The lawsuits are:

v.

et

MGM
MIRAGE,
et
al.
(Case No. 2:09-cv-02011-LRH-RJJ, filed October 19, 2009) putative class actions under the caption "In re MGM MIRAGE Securities Litigation." The cases na me
the Company and certain former and current directors and officers as defendants and allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. After transf er of the cases in 2010 to the Honorable Gloria M. Navarro, the court
appointed several employee retirement benefits funds as co-lead plaintiffs and their counsel as co-lead and co-liaison counsel.  In January 2011, lead plaintiffs filed a
consolidated ame nded complaint, alleging that between August 2, 2007 and March 5, 2009, the Company, its directors and certain of its officers violated Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

In September 2013, the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint. Defendants answered the amended complaint, the court
entered a scheduling order and discovery commenced. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in November 2014. Defendants filed their opposition to class
certification in February 2015. The court heard oral argument on the class certification motion on April 21, 2015 and took the matter under advisement.  No trial date
was set in this case.

In July 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants agreed in principle to settle the securities class actions. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs and defendants
entered  into  a  Stipulation  and  Agreement  of  Settlement  (the  “Settlement  Agreement”).  Under  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  the  claims  against  the
Company and the named former and current directors and officers will be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $75 million cash payment by the
Company’s directors and officers liability insurers. In August 2015, the lead plaintiffs filed with the court an Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval of the
Settlement Agreement. In September 2015, the court entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement, preliminarily certified the class for settlement purposes
only, established class notification procedures and scheduled a hearing for December 15, 2015 to determine whether to grant final approval to the settlement.

On December 7, 2015, the court entered an order on a stipulation by the parties, which, among other things, continued the approval hearing to January 29,
2016 to allow additional time to provide notice of the settlement to class members. On January 21, 2016, the court again continued the hearing for final settlement
approval, to allow the court time to first resolve a then-pending motion by a non-party to compel certain discovery from the lead plaintiffs’ counsel. On January 27,
2016, the court denied the motion to compel. The hearing for final settlement approval has been scheduled for March 1, 2016.

If  the  court  grants  final  approval  of  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  enters  the  proposed  judgment,  all  claims  in  these  cases  against  the  Company  and  the
individual defendants will be resolved. In the event that defendants are unable to obtain final court approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Company and all other
defendants plan to continue to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in these securities cases.

Other.

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not

believe that the outcome of such pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 3,956 record holders of our common stock as of February 24, 2016.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last three fiscal years.  As a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay
dividends will depend upon the receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.  Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenants
and restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions.  In addition, the MGM National Harbor and the MGM China
credit facilities each contain limitations on their ability to pay dividends to us.  Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our policy with respect to dividends, and
any determination to pay dividends in the future will depend on our financial position, future capital requirements and financial debt covenants and any other factors
deemed necessary by the Board of Directors.  Moreover, should we pay any dividends in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such
dividends.

SELECTED
FINANCIAL
DATA

The following reflects selected historical financial data that should be read in conjunction with “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results  of  Operations”  and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.  The
financial information presented below has been adjusted for adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Cost,” (“ASU 2015-03”), which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt
liability.  Additionally,  prior  period  amounts  have  not  been  adjusted  for  adoption  of  Accounting  Standard  Update  No.  2015-17,  "Balance  Sheet  Classification  of
Deferred Taxes," (“ASU 2015-17”), which we early adopted on a prospective basis. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any
related  valuation  allowance,  be  classified  as  noncurrent  in  a  classified  statement  of  financial  position.  For  additional  information,  please  see  recently  issued
accounting standards section in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations to be expected in the future.

M
ANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND
ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL
CONDITION
AND
RESULTS
OF
OPERATIONS

Executive
Overview

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort
amenities. We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.
Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability
of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings.  We make
significant  investments  in  our  resorts  through  newly  remodeled  hotel  rooms,  restaurants,  entertainment  and  nightlife  offerings,  as  well  as  other  new  features  and
amenities.

According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 3%, Las Vegas Strip REVPAR increased 3% and Las
Vegas Strip gaming revenue decreased less than 1% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Results of operations for our wholly owned domestic resorts during 2015
benefited from an increase in operating margins resulting from increases in gaming revenue and REVPAR. Our rooms revenue benefited from increased visitation to
the Las Vegas market and robust convention business at our Las Vegas Strip resorts, which resulted in increases in occupancy and allowed us to yield higher room
rates across our portfolio of resorts.

Gross  gaming  revenues  in  the  Macau  market  decreased  34%  in  2015  compared  to  2014.    We  believe  operating  results  have  been  negatively  affected  by
economic  conditions  and  certain  policy  initiatives  in  China  and  the  implementation  of  a  full  main  floor  casino  smoking  ban  in  October  2014.  Additionally,  we
believe  stricter  enforcement  of  entrance  into  Macau  via  the  use  of  transit  visas,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  duration  of  stay  permitted  for  transit  visa  holders,  has
negatively  affected  operating  results;  however,  restrictions  surrounding  the  use  of  transit  visas  were  eased  in  July  2015.  The  decrease  in  gross  gaming  revenues
accelerated  during  the  second  half  of 2014 and continued  throughout  2015 as Macau  has become  an increasingly  challenging  and competitive  market,  impacting
primarily VIP casino gaming operations and, to a lesser extent, main floor operations. According to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the
Macau Government, visitor arrivals decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. Despite concerns over the recent events and the sustainability of economic growth in
China,  we  expect  the  Macau  market  to  grow  on  a  long-term  basis  due  to  further  development  and  penetration  of  the  mainland  China  market  and  infrastructure
improvements expected to facilitate more convenient travel to and within Macau.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital.  While we continue
to be focused on improving our financial position, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on development opportunities. In Macau, we plan to spend approximately
$3.0 billion, excluding development fees eliminated  in consolidation, capitalized  interest  and land related  costs, to develop MGM Cotai, a resort and casino with
capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms, built on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip
in Macau.  The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may be
less than our 500 gaming table capacity.   MGM Cotai is expected to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017.

We  were  awarded  the  sixth  and  final  casino  license  under  current  statutes  in  the  State  of  Maryland  by  the  Maryland  Video  Lottery  Facility  Location
Commission  to  build  and  operate  MGM  National  Harbor,  a  destination  casino  resort  in  Prince  George’s  County  at  National  Harbor,  which  is  a  waterfront
development located on the Potomac River just outside of Washington, D.C. We currently expect the cost to develop and construct MGM National Harbor to be
approximately $1.3 billion, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs. We designed the resort to include a casino with approximately 3,600 slots and 160
table games including poker; a 300-room hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool; 93,100 square feet of high-end branded retail and fine and casual dining; a 3,000-
seat theater venue; 50,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 4,700-space parking garage. We expect MGM National Harbor to open in the fourth quarter
of 2016.

We  were  awarded  a  casino  license  to  build  and  operate  MGM  Springfield  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts.  MGM  Springfield  will  be  developed  on
approximately 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM’s plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and
100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-
space  parking  garage;  with  an  expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized  interest  and  land-related  costs.
Construction of MGM Springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.

We entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (“AEG”) to design, construct, and operate an arena, which will be
located on a parcel of our land between Frank Sinatra Drive and New York-New York, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. We and AEG each own 50% of Las Vegas
Arena Company, the developer of the arena. In September 2014, a wholly

30

owned subsidiary of Las Vegas Arena Company entered into a $200 million senior secured credit facility to finance const ruction of the arena. The Las Vegas Arena
Company recently entered into a multi-year naming rights agreement with T-Mobile. T-Mobile Arena will seat between 18,000 and 20,000 people and is scheduled
to open in the April 2016. Such development is estimated to cost approximately $350 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs. In addition, we
are building The Park entertainment district which connects to New York-New York, Monte Carlo and T-Mobile Arena.

In  August  2015,  we  announced  the  implementation  of  a  Profit  Growth  Plan  for  sustained  growth  and  margin  enhancement.  The  Profit  Growth  Plan’s
initiatives are focused on improving business processes to optimize our scale for greater efficiency and lower cost throughout our business, and to identify areas of
opportunity to organically drive incremental revenue growth. The Profit Growth Plan includes a large number of opportunities to enhance our business operations
and we continue to explore additional opportunities to drive further margin enhancements. The plan is expected to result in approximately $300 million of annualized
Adjusted EBITDA benefit. The Profit Growth Plan has begun to show significant results and is expected to be fully realized by the end of 2017.

On October 29, 2015, we announced the formation of MGP as a newly formed subsidiary that we expect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to contribute to a newly-formed operating partnership that MGP will control through a general partner subsidiary the
real  estate  associated  with Mandalay  Bay, The Mirage,  New York-New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo, Excalibur,  The Park, MGM Grand Detroit,  Beau Rivage and
Gold Strike Tunica (collectively, the “Properties”). We also intend to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt outstanding under our
existing senior credit facility and senior notes, which refinancing debt would be assumed by the operating partnership in connection with the REIT transactions. One
of our subsidiaries will then lease the Properties from MGP for use under a long-term, “triple net” master lease agreement with a 10-year term that includes four five-
year extensions at our option. We will guarantee our subsidiary’s obligations under the master lease. We expect to retain through subsidiaries an approximate 70%
economic interest in the new operating partnership, as well as voting control of MGP through our ownership of a controlling share in MGP.

Reportable
Segments

We have two reportable segments that are based on the regions in which we operate: wholly owned domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently operate
12 wholly owned resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of MGM Macau resort and the development of MGM Cotai on the Cotai Strip in
Macau. We have additional business activities including investments in unconsolidated affiliates, our MGM Hospitality operations and certain other corporate and
management operations. CityCenter is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.  Our operations that are not segregated into
separate reportable segments are reported as “corporate and other” operations in our reconciliations of segment results to consolidated results.

Wholly
owned
domestic
resorts.
At December 31, 2015, our wholly owned domestic resorts consisted of the following casino resorts:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Other:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons),
The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo and Circus Circus Las Vegas.
MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica,
Mississippi.

Over  half  of  the  net  revenue  from  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts  is  derived  from  non-gaming  operations  including  hotel,  food  and  beverage,
entertainment  and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customer groups and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities  to maximize
hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also leads to better labor
utilization.  Our operating results are highly dependent on demand for our services, and the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can
charge  for  our  hotel  rooms  and  other  amenities.    Also,  we  generate  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenue  from  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts  in  Las  Vegas,
Nevada, which exposes us to certain risks, such as increased competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in the United
States generally.

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts are:

·

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games hold percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table games drop and our normal slots hold percentage is approximately 8.5%
of slots handle; and

31

·

Hotel  revenue  indicators:  hotel  occupancy  (a  volume  indicator);  average  daily  rate  (“  ADR,”  a  price  indicator);  and  revenue  per  available  room
(“REVPAR,”  a  summary  measure  of  hotel  results,  combining  ADR  and  occupancy  rate).  Our  calculation  of  ADR,  which  is  the  average  price  of
occupied  rooms  per  day,  includes  the  impact  of  complimentary  ro  oms.  Complimentary  room  rates  are  determined  based  on  an  analysis  of  retail  or
“cash”  rates  for  each  customer  segment  and  each  type  of  room  product  to  estimate  complimentary  rates  which  are  consistent  with  retail  rates.
Complimentary rates are reviewed at least annually and on an interim basis if there are significant changes in market conditions. Because the mix of
rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR inclu ding
complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

MGM
China.
We own a 51% controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates MGM
Macau and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is in the process of developing MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment
resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau.  We believe our investment in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future
growth and profitability.

Revenues  at  MGM  Macau  are  generated  from  three  primary  customer  segments  in  the  Macau  gaming  market:  VIP  casino  gaming  operations,  main  floor
gaming operations, and slot machine operations. VIP players play mostly in dedicated VIP rooms or designated gaming areas. VIP customers can be further divided
into customers sourced by in-house VIP programs and those sourced through gaming promoters. A significant portion of our VIP volume is generated through the
use of gaming promoters. Gaming promoters introduce VIP gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming
credit to these players. In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements or rolling chip turnover
based commissions.  In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate.  MGM Macau main floor operations
primarily consist of walk-in and day trip visitors. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions.  The profit
contribution  from  the  main  floor  segment  exceeds  the  VIP  segment  due  to  commission  costs  paid  to  gaming  promoters.  Gaming  revenues  from  the  main  floor
segment  have  become  an  increasingly  significant  portion  of  total  gaming  revenues  in  recent  years  and  we  believe  this  segment  represents  the  most  potential  for
sustainable growth in the future.

VIP gaming at MGM Macau is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips
from MGM Macau and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering conducted by each
gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play.  Gaming promoter commissions are based on either a percentage of actual win plus a monthly
complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the rolling chip turnover their customers generate, or a percentage of the rolling chip turnover plus discounted
offerings on nongaming amenities. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter payments that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is recorded as a
reduction  of  casino  revenue,  and  the  estimated  portion  retained  by  the  gaming  promoter  for  its  compensation  is  recorded  as  casino  expense.    In-house  VIP
commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.

In  addition  to  the  key  performance  indicators  used  by  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts,  MGM  Macau  utilizes  “turnover,”  which  is  the  sum  of
nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM Macau calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned.
Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage.  Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM Macau is typically in the range of 2.7% to 3.0% of
turnover.

Corporate
and
other.
Corporate and other includes our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and certain management and other operations.

Consolidated net revenues for 2015 decreased 9% compared to 2014 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue at MGM China, offset by increases in
casino and non-casino revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts. Consolidated net revenues for 2014 increased 3% compared to 2013 due primarily to increased
casino and non-casino revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts.

Consolidated  operating  loss  of  $156  million  in  2015  was  negatively  affected  by  an  operating  loss  for  MGM  China  that  included  a  $1.5  billion  non-cash
impairment charge to goodwill recognized in the acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China. We recorded a $3.5 billion non-cash gain in 2011 in connection
with that acquisition. The current impairment charge, which represents approximately 42% of the amount of the previously recognized gain, resulted from our annual
review of our goodwill carrying values and was incurred as a result of reduced cash flow forecasts for MGM China’s resorts based on current market conditions and
lower valuation multiples for gaming assets in the Macau market. In addition, the operating loss was affected by a decrease in operating results at MGM Macau. The
operating  loss  for  MGM  China  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  operating  income  at  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts  and  an  increase  in  income  from
unconsolidated affiliates, primarily from CityCenter, which included $80 million related to our share of the gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final
resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements. In addition, corporate expense increased 15% to $275 million in 2015, due primarily to costs incurred
to implement initiatives in relation to the Profit Growth Plan of $24 million and costs associated with our proposed REIT transaction of $20 million.  Preopening
expense  primarily  related  to  our  ongoing  MGM  Cotai,  MGM  Springfield  and  MGM  National  Harbor  development  projects  increased  to  $71  million  in  2015
compared to $39 million in 2014. Consolidated operating loss in 2015 was also negatively affected by impairment charges and losses on disposal of certain assets, in
addition  to  the  MGM  China  goodwill  impairment  charge  discussed  above,  recorded  in  “Property  transactions,  net.”  See  “Operating  Results  –  Details  of  Certain
Charges” below for additional detail on our preopening expense and property transactions.

Consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2014 benefited from an increase in revenue at our wholly owned domestic resorts and an increase in main
floor table games revenue at MGM China, as well as a decrease in property transactions, net to $41 million in 2014 compared to $125 million in 2013.  In addition,
depreciation and amortization expense decreased $33 million in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to certain assets at our wholly owned resorts and MGM China
becoming  fully  depreciated  and  a  decrease  in  amortization  expense  for  intangible  assets.    Operating  income  was  negatively  affected  by  increases  in  general  and
administrative  expense,  corporate  expense  and  preopening  expense.  General  and  administrative  expense  increased  primarily  related  to  an  increase  in  payroll  and
related  expense.  Corporate  expense  increased  10%  in  2014,  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  payroll  costs  and  professional  fees  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in
development related costs. Preopening expense increased to $39 million in 2014, compared to $13 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the commencement of
development on MGM Springfield and MGM National Harbor.

Food  and  beverage  revenues  increased  2%  in  2015  compared  to  2014  primarily  as  a  result  of  increased  convention  and  banquet  business  as  well  as  the
opening of several new outlets. Food and beverage revenues increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of the same items noted above for the 2015 and 2014
comparative period. Entertainment, retail and other revenues decreased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to a 5% decrease in revenue from Cirque du
Soleil production shows, partially offset by a 5% increase in retail revenue. Entertainment, retail and other revenues increased 5% in 2014 compared to 2013, due
primarily to the Michael Jackson ONE Cirque du Soleil production show being open for the full year in 2014 compared to a partial year in 2013.

Adjusted Property EBITDA at our wholly owned domestic resorts was $1.7 billion in 2015, an increase of 11% compared to 2014 due primarily to improved

Net revenue for MGM China decreased 33% in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a decrease in VIP table games revenue of 44%, as well as a
decrease in main floor table games revenue of 20%. VIP table games turnover decreased 54% compared to the prior year, while VIP table games hold percentage
increased  to  3.3%  in  2015  from  2.8%  in  2014.  Slots  revenue  decreased  20%  in  2015  compared  to  2014  due  to  a  23%  decrease  in  slots  volume.  Casino  revenue
continued to be negatively affected throughout 2015 by the changes in economic factors and policy initiatives in China that began to take place in 2014.

MGM China’s Adjusted EBITDA was $540 million in 2015 and $850 million in 2014. Excluding branding fees of $39 million and $43 million for the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 35% compared to 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 150
basis points to 24.4% in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in casino revenue.

Net  revenue  for  MGM  China  decreased  1%  in  2014  compared  to  2013  due  to  a  decrease  in  VIP  table  games  revenue  of  16%,  partially  offset  by  a  34%
increase in main floor table games revenue. VIP table games turnover decreased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of changes in economic factors
and policy initiatives in China.   VIP table games hold percentage remained flat at 2.8% in 2014 and 2013.  Additionally, gaming tables were reallocated to main
floor table games from VIP table games during 2014 to meet increased demand.  Main floor gaming revenue benefited from overall Macau market growth as well as
management’s

35

strategic focus on premium main floor table games business in 2014 as compared to 2013. Slots revenue decreased 10% in 2014 compared t o 2013 due to a decrease
in hold percentage to 4.4% in 2014 from 5.1% in 2013.

MGM China’s Adjusted EBITDA was $850 million in 2014 and $814 million in 2013. Excluding branding fees of $43 million and $36 million for the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% compared to 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased approximately 140 basis
points to 25.9% in 2014 as a result of an increase in main floor table games revenue, partially offset by a 15% increase in payroll and related costs.

Corporate
and
other.
  Corporate and other revenue includes revenues from other corporate operations, management services and reimbursed costs revenue
primarily related to our CityCenter management agreement. Reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs, primarily payroll-related, incurred by us in
connection with the provision of management services and was $399 million, $383 million and $365 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Adjusted  EBITDA  related  to  corporate  and  other  in  2015  included  our  share  of  operating  income  from  CityCenter,  including  certain  basis  difference
adjustments, compared to operating loss from CityCenter in the prior year, and an increase in our share of operating income from Borgata in 2015 compared to 2014.
See “Operating Results – Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion. The increases in income from CityCenter and Borgata were partially
offset by increased corporate expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 as discussed previously under “Summary Operating Results.”

Adjusted EBITDA losses related to corporate and other increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to our share of operating loss from CityCenter,
including  certain  basis  difference  adjustments,  compared  to  operating  income  from  CityCenter  in  the  prior  year,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  our  share  of
operating  income  from  Borgata.    See  “Operating  Results  –  Income  (Loss)  from  Unconsolidated  Affiliates”  for  further  discussion.  In  addition,  corporate  expense
increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as discussed previously under “Summary Operating Results.”

In 2015, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $159 million and included $80 million related to our
share of a gain recognized by CityCenter as a result of the final resolution of its construction litigation and related settlements, compared to an operating loss of $12
million in 2014. Casino revenue at Aria increased 6% in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to an increase in table games volume and slots volume of 2% and 3%,
respectively. CityCenter’s rooms revenue increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014, due to increases in REVPAR of 6% and 8% at Aria and Vdara, respectively. The
increase in revenues from resort operations was partially offset by a decrease in residential revenues. CityCenter’s operating income in the current year benefited
from a $99 million decrease in depreciation expense as a result of certain furniture and equipment becoming fully depreciated in December 2014 offset in part by
$20  million  in  accelerated  depreciation  for  certain  assets  associated  with  the  Zarkana  theatre,  which  is  scheduled  to  close  in  April  2016.    CityCenter’s  operating
income also benefited from a $26 million decrease in legal and professional fees as a result of the final resolution of construction litigation and related settlements.
Our share of Borgata’s operating income increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to an increase in casino and non-casino revenues and improved operating margins.

In  2014,  we  recognized  a  $12  million  loss  related  to  our  50%  share  of  CityCenter’s  operating  results,  including  certain  basis  difference  adjustments,
compared to income of $22 million in 2013. CityCenter’s operating loss in 2014 was negatively affected by $62 million of property transactions, net and a decrease
in residential sales compared to 2013, as well as an increase in payroll and related costs and casino bad debt expense. Casino revenues at Aria decreased 5% in 2014
compared to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in table games hold percentage to 23.5% in 2014 from 24.7% in 2013. CityCenter’s rooms revenues increased 11% in
2014 compared to 2013, due to increases in REVPAR of 10% and 14% at Aria and Vdara, respectively.  Our share of Borgata’s operating income increased in 2014
compared to 2013 and benefited from a reduction in real estate taxes recognized by Borgata.

In  2015,  interest  cost  related  to  MGM  Resorts,  excluding  China,  decreased  compared  to  2014  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  the  average  long-term  debt
outstanding during the year related to our senior notes. Interest cost related to MGM China increased in 2015 compared to the prior year due to an increase in the
average outstanding amounts borrowed under the MGM China credit facility and an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from costs incurred
associated with the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility in June 2015. In 2014, interest cost related to MGM Resorts, excluding China, decreased compared
to 2013 as a result of a decrease in weighted average long-term debt outstanding during the year, primarily relating to borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Amortization of debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs included in interest expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $46 million, $38 million and $35 million,
respectively.

Capitalized interest in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due primarily to the MGM Cotai, National Harbor, and Springfield projects, and our investment in

the Las Vegas Arena Company. Capitalized interest in 2014 and 2013 primarily related to the MGM Cotai project.

Non-operating
items
from
unconsolidated
affiliates.
  Non-operating  expense from unconsolidated  affiliates  decreased  $11 million  in 2015 compared  to
2014, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense at CityCenter. Non-operating expense from unconsolidated affiliates decreased $121 million in 2014 compared
to  2013,  due  to  a  decrease  in  interest  expense  at  CityCenter  as  a  result  of  debt  restructuring  transactions  in  October  2013,  lower  statutory  interest  recorded  by
CityCenter related to estimated amounts owed in connection with the CityCenter construction litigation and the net impact of the following other non-operating items
from unconsolidated affiliates recognized in 2013: a $70 million loss for our share of CityCenter’s loss on retirement of long-term debt in October 2013, and $12
million for our share of a gain recognized on debt restructuring transactions at Silver Legacy.

Our  effective  tax  rate  in  2015  was  impacted  by  the  non-cash  impairment  charge  on  MGM  China  goodwill  for  which  we  did  not  record  income  tax
benefit.  Our effective tax rate decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of providing greater tax benefit in 2015 than in 2014 for foreign tax credits,
net  of  valuation  allowance,  partially  offset  by  tax  benefit  resulting  from  audit  settlements  in  2014.  Our  effective  tax  rate  increased  in  2014  compared  to  2013
primarily as a result of the reduced tax benefit in 2014 for foreign tax credits, net of valuation allowance, partially offset by tax provision in 2013 resulting from re-
measuring the Macau net deferred tax liability due to the extension of the amortization period of the MGM China gaming subconcession upon effectiveness of the
Cotai land concession.

Cash taxes paid decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a $16 million refund of taxes and associated interest received in 2015 on the
closure  of  the  IRS  examination  of  CityCenter,  which  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  income  tax  purposes  which  partially  offset  federal  income  tax  estimated  tax
payments of $23 million made during the year.  The remaining $5

38

million of cash taxes paid in 2015 consist of state and foreign income taxes. Cash t axes paid increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of $30 million
paid to IRS for the closure of examinations covering the 2005 through 2009 tax years and $8 million estimated taxes paid to the IRS during 2014.  The remaining $4
million of cash taxes paid in 2014 consist of state and foreign income taxes. Cash taxes paid in 2013 consisted primarily of foreign and state taxes.

Non-GAAP
Measures

“Adjusted  EBITDA”  is  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up
expenses, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to
the  MGM  Resorts  stock  option  plan,  which  is  not  allocated  to  each  reportable  segment  or  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stock
compensation  expense related  to its  stock compensation  plan  which is included  in the calculation  of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted Property EBITDA information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes these measures
are  1)  widely  used  measures  of  operating  performance  in  the  gaming  and  hospitality  industry,  and  2)  a  principal  basis  for  valuation  of  gaming  and  hospitality
companies.

We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in
evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items
can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe
excluded  items  may  not  relate  specifically  to  current  operating  trends  or  be  indicative  of  future  results.  For  example,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses  will  be
significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the
development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets
related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on
entire  asset  groups  or  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  may  not  be  comparable  period  over  period.  In  addition,  capital  allocation,  tax  planning,
financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measure of wholly
owned domestic resorts operating performance.

Adjusted  EBITDA  or  Adjusted  Property  EBITDA  should  not  be  construed  as  an  alternative  to  operating  income  or  net  income,  as  an  indicator  of  our
performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which
are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA
or Adjusted Property EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA in a different manner.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss attributable to MGM Resorts International:

Summary

We  require  a  certain  amount  of  cash  on  hand  to  operate  our  resorts.    In  addition  to  required  cash  on  hand  for  operations,  we  utilize  company-wide  cash
management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks.  Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts, and
excess  funds  are  invested  overnight  or  are  used  to  repay  borrowings  under  our  senior  credit  facility.  In  addition,  from  time  to  time  we  may  use  excess  funds  to
repurchase our outstanding debt securities subject to limitations in our senior credit facility.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held cash and cash equivalents of
$1.7 billion. Cash and cash equivalents related to MGM China at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $700 million and $546 million, respectively.

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital,

the timing of significant tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China which were $383 million in 2015 compared
to $642 million in 2014, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts.  In 2015, cash provided by operating activities
at MGM China was negatively affected by changes in working capital related to short term gaming liabilities but to a lesser extent than in 2014.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased due to a decrease in operating cash flows at MGM China compared to $932 million in 2013, partially
offset by an increase in operating cash flows at our wholly owned domestic resorts and lower cash paid for interest. Cash provided by operating activities at MGM
China  was  negatively  affected  by  changes  in  working  capital  related  to  short-term  gaming  liabilities  in  2014  while  operating  cash  flows  at  MGM  China  were
positively impacted by changes in working capital in 2013.

We paid net taxes of $12 million, $42 million and $1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Cash
Flows
–
Investing
Activities

Our  investing  cash  flows  can  fluctuate  significantly  from  year  to  year  depending  on  our  decisions  with  respect  to  strategic  capital  investments  in  new  or
existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of more regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures
related to more regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.
Most of such costs relate to construction materials, furniture and fixtures, and external labor costs.

·

In 2015, we had capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, which included $579 million at MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest
on development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $543 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai
and $36 million related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities of $888
million included $361 million and $35

42

million related to the construction of MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield, respectively, various room remodels including the tower rooms at
Mandalay Bay and the suites at Bellagio, construction of additional exhibit space at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, construction of the Monte
Carlo theater, construction of The Park entertainment district, and restaurant and entertainm ent venue remodels.

In 2014, we had capital expenditures of $872 million, which included $346 million at MGM China, excluding capitalized interest on development fees
eliminated  in  consolidation.  Capital  expenditures  at  MGM  China  included  $301  million  related  to  the  construction  of  MGM  Cotai  and  $45  million
related to improvements at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities included $97 million related
to the construction of MGM National Harbor, various room remodels including the Delano rooms at Mandalay Bay and suites at Bellagio, a remodel of
the facades of New York-New York and Monte Carlo, construction of The Park entertainment district, restaurant and entertainment venue remodels and
costs incurred to relocate and renovate certain corporate offices.

In  2013,  we  had  capital  expenditures  of  $562  million,  which  included  $239  million  at  MGM  China,  excluding  development  fees  eliminated  in
consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China primarily related to the construction of MGM Cotai, including a $47 million construction deposit.
We  spent  approximately  $324  million  in  2013  related  to  capital  expenditures  at  corporate  entities  and  our  wholly  owned  domestic  resorts,  which
included expenditures for a remodel of the front façades of New York-New York and Monte Carlo, room remodels, theater renovations, information
technology and slot machine purchases.

In 2015, investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates primarily represented investments in CityCenter pursuant to the completion guarantee of
$141 million and investments in the Las Vegas Arena Company of $50 million. In 2014, investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates primarily represented
investments  in CityCenter  of $56 million,  investments  in the Las Vegas Arena Company of $36 million,  and investments in MGM Hakkasan of $10 million.  In
2013, investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates primarily represented investments in CityCenter of $24 million.

In 2015, investing activities also included proceeds of $20 million related to the sale of Railroad Pass and Gold Strike Jean, proceeds of $72 million (net of
cash included in the sale) related to the sale of Circus Circus Reno and the Company’s 50% interest in Silver Legacy, and $202 million of distributions received from
unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  includes  a  $200  million  distribution  paid  by  CityCenter  in  April  2015.    In  addition,  we  invested  $200  million  in  certificates  of
deposit with original maturities longer than 90 days and received proceeds of $770 million related to the maturity of certificates of deposit with original maturities
longer than 90 days.

Investing  activities  also  include  activity  related  to  investments  of  funds  held  by  the  trust  that  held  our  50%  ownership  interest  in  Borgata  prior  to  its

dissolution in September 2014. In addition, in 2014 we invested $570 million in certificates of deposit with original maturities longer than 90 days.

Financing
Activities

In 2015, we had net borrowings of $102 million, including $1.0 billion of borrowings under the MGM China credit facility, the repayment of $28 million
under our senior credit facility and the repayment of the $875 million 6.625% senior notes at maturity in July 2015 using cash on hand. Additionally, we paid $46
million of debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of the MGM China credit facility. MGM China paid a $400 million special dividend in March 2015, a $120
million  final  dividend  in  June  2015  and  a  $76  million  interim  dividend  in  August  2015,  of  which  $196  million,  $59  million  and  $37  million  was  distributed  to
noncontrolling  interests,  respectively.  Additionally,  we  received  $6  million  in  2015  related  to  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  non-voting  membership  interests  in
MGM National Harbor.

In 2014, we had net borrowings of $714 million, including the repayment of $28 million under our senior credit facility. During the year we repaid our $509
million 5.875% senior notes at maturity and issued $1.25 billion of 6% senior notes, due 2023 for net proceeds of $1.24 billion. MGM China paid a $499 million
special dividend in March 2014, a $127 million final dividend in June 2014, and a $137 million interim dividend in September 2014, of which $245 million, $62
million and $67 million was distributed to noncontrolling interests, respectively.

In 2013, we repaid net debt of $140 million including $28 million under our senior credit facility. We issued $500 million in 5.25% senior notes due 2020 and

repaid the following senior notes:

·

·

$462 million outstanding principal amount of our 6.75% senior notes; and
$150 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.625% senior subordinated debentures at maturity.

We incurred $24 million of debt issuance costs rela ted to the re-pricing of the term loan B facility in May 2013 and the December 2013 issuance of the $500

million of 5.25% senior notes due 2020.

MGM China paid a $500 million special dividend in March 2013 and a $113 million interim dividend in September 2013, of which $245 million and $55

million was distributed to noncontrolling interests, respectively.

Other
Factors
Affecting
Liquidity

Anticipated
uses
of
cash.
 We have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures. At December 31,
2015, we had $1.5 billion of principal amount of long-term debt maturing in 2016, primarily related to our $242.9 million 6.875% senior notes, $732.7 million 7.5%
senior notes, and $500 million 10% senior notes, and an estimated $750 million of cash interest payments based on current outstanding debt and applicable interest
rates, within the next twelve months.

We expect to make the following capital investments, excluding capitalized interest, during 2016:

·

·

·

Approximately $440 million in capital expenditures at our wholly owned domestic resorts and corporate entities, which includes expenditures on The
Park, the Monte Carlo theatre, the new Excalibur parking garage, and replacement of aircraft;
Approximately $130 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM Springfield project; and
Approximately $680 million in capital expenditures related to the MGM National Harbor project.

During 2016, MGM China expects to spend approximately $50 million in capital improvements at MGM Macau and $1.6 billion on the MGM Cotai project,

excluding capitalized interest, development fees and land related costs.

Our capital expenditures fluctuate depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts and the timing of capital
investments to maintain the quality of our resorts, the amounts of which can vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and
hotel rooms. Future capital  expenditures  could vary from  our current  expectations  depending on the progress of our development  efforts  and the structure  of our
ownership interests in future developments.

Cotai
land
concession.
  MGM Grand Paradise’s land concession contract for an approximate 18 acre site in Cotai, Macau became effective on January 9,
2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. The total land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed
of a down payment and eight additional semi-annual payments. As of December 31, 2015, MGM China had paid $130 million of the contract premium, including
interest  due  on  the  semi-annual  payments.  In  January  2016,  MGM  China  paid  the  sixth  semi-annual  payment  of  $15  million  under  the  land  concession  contract.
Including interest on the two remaining semi-annual payments, MGM China has $29 million remaining payable for the land concession contract.

MGM
China
dividend.
  On February 18, 2016, as part of its regular dividend policy, MGM China’s Board of Directors announced it will recommend a
final dividend for 2015 of $46 million to MGM China shareholders subject to approval at the MGM China 2016 annual shareholders meeting to be held in May.  If
approved, we will receive $23 million, our 51% share of the 2015 final dividend.

REIT
transaction.
In connection with the proposed REIT transaction, we expect to incur approximately $4 billion of debt to refinance a portion of the debt
outstanding under our existing senior credit facility and certain of our senior notes, which refinancing debt will be assumed by the Operating Partnership and repaid
with the equity proceeds from the contemplated IPO and concurrent debt financings.

Principal
Debt
Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior notes and our senior credit facility.  At December 31, 2015, excluding MGM China, we had $11.3 billion
principal amount of indebtedness, including $2.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under our $3.9 billion senior credit facility. We pay fixed rates of interest ranging
from 5.25% to 11.375% on our senior notes.  Our senior credit facility consists of a $1.2 billion revolving loan facility, a $1.02 billion term loan A facility and a
$1.70 billion term loan B facility.  The revolving and term loan A facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by our credit rating (2.75% as
of December 31, 2015).  The term loan B facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.  The revolving and term loan A facilities mature
in December 2017. The term loan B facility matures in December 2019.  The term loan A and term loan B facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments
on the last day of each calendar quarter in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal balance.  We had approximately $1.2 billion of available borrowing
capacity under our senior credit facility at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan A was 3.17% and the interest rate on the
term loan B was 3.50%.

44

The land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas, Bellagio and The Mirage secure up to $3.35 billion of obligations outstanding under
the senior credit facility.  In addition, the land and substantially all of the assets of New York-New York and Gold Strike Tunica secure the entire amount of the
senior credit facility, and the land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Detroit secure its $450 million of obligations as a co-borrower under the senior
credit facility. In addition, the senior credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own the pledged
properties.

The senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, the senior credit
facility  requires  us  and  our  restricted  subsidiaries  (the  “Restricted  Group”)  to  maintain  a  minimum  trailing  four-quarter  EBITDA  and  limits  the  ability  of  the
Restricted Group to make capital expenditures and investments. As of December 31, 2015, the Restricted Group is required to maintain a minimum EBITDA (as
defined) of $1.30 billion.  The minimum EBITDA increases to $1.35 billion for March 31, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and to $1.40 billion for March 31, 2017
and  thereafter.    EBITDA  for  the  trailing  four  quarters  ended  December  31,  2015  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  senior  credit  facility  was  $1.71
billion.  In accordance with our senior credit facility covenants, the Restricted Group is limited to annual capital expenditures of $500 million in each year beginning
with  2013  with  unused  amounts  in  any  fiscal  year  rolling  over  to  the  next  fiscal  year,  but  not  any  fiscal  year  thereafter.  Our  total  Restricted  Group  capital
expenditures allowable under the senior credit facility for 2015, after giving effect to the unused amount from 2014, was $794 million. In addition, our senior credit
facility limits the Restricted Group’s ability to make investments subject to certain thresholds and other important exceptions. The Restricted Group was within the
limit  of  capital  expenditures  and  other  investments  for  2015.  We  believe  we  have  sufficient  capacity  under  these  thresholds  to  fund  our  planned  development
activity.

The  senior  credit  facility  provides  for  customary  events  of  default,  including,  without  limitation,  (i)  payment  defaults,  (ii)  covenant  defaults,  (iii)  cross-
defaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, (iv) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (v) judgment defaults in excess of specified
amounts, (vi) the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance, in the reasonable judgment of the required
lenders, is materially  adverse to the lenders, or (vii) the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of the
collateral. In addition, the senior credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation, suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specified
amount of its revenues or assets, will constitute an event of default.

All of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (which is a co-
borrower under our senior credit facility), MGM National Harbor, LLC and Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the company that will own and operate our proposed
casino in Springfield, Massachusetts), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our international subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are not
guarantors of such indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt
securities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise pursuant to authorization of our Board of Directors and in accordance
with the terms of our senior credit facilities.

In June 2015, MGM China and MGM Grand Paradise, as co-borrowers, entered into a second amended and restated credit facility which consists of $1.55
billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2015 of $1.6 billion was comprised solely of term loans.
The interest rate on the facility fluctuates annually based on HIBOR plus a margin that will range between 1.375% and 2.50% based on MGM China’s leverage ratio.
The MGM China credit facility is secured by MGM Grand Paradise’s interest in the Cotai land use right, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor
subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. The credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and
for the development of the Cotai project.

The MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which
impose restrictions on, among other things, the ability of MGM China and its subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends and sell assets, and to incur additional
liens. As of December 31, 2015, MGM China was required to maintain compliance with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 in addition to a minimum interest
coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00.  MGM China was in compliance with the credit facility covenants at December 31, 2015.

In February 2016, the MGM China credit facility was amended to increase the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio. The maximum total leverage ratio
increases to 6.00 to 1.00 for September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2017, and then decreases to 5.50 to 1.00 for September 30, 2017, 5.00 to 1.00 for December 31,
2017, and 4.50 to 1.00 for March 31, 2018 and thereafter.

In January 2016, MGM National Harbor, LLC, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary developing and constructing MGM National Harbor, entered into a
$100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million delayed draw term loan facility, of which $250 million was funded at closing. The revolving and term loan
facilities will initially bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus an additional rate ranging from 2.00% to 2.25% per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio) . The
term loan is subject to

45

scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening of MGM National Harbor,
initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance on the last day of the
twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarters, respectively. The term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in January 2021.

The credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on MGM National Harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property of MGM National
Harbor. Mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including sales of certain assets, casualty events and the incurrence of certain
additional  indebtedness,  subject  to  certain  exceptions  and  reinvestment  rights.  In  addition,  to  the  extent  MGM  National  Harbor  generates  excess  cash  flow  (as
defined  in the credit  agreement),  a percentage  of such excess  cash flow (ranging  from  0% to 50% based on a total leverage  ratio)  will be required  to be used to
prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ended 2017.

The  credit  agreement  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  affirmative  covenants  and  negative  covenants,  which  impose
restrictions on, among other things, the ability of MGM National Harbor, LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends, sell assets, and to
incur  additional  debt  and  additional  liens.  In  addition,  the  credit  agreement  requires  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  its  restricted  subsidiaries  to  maintain  a
maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a customary “in balance test”
(as defined in the credit agreement), which looks to the sufficiency of MGM National Harbor, LLC’s available resources to complete the MGM National Harbor
casino resort.

Off
Balance
Sheet
Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our investments in CityCenter,
Grand  Victoria,  Borgata,  and  T-Mobile  Arena.    We  have  not  entered  into  any  transactions  with  special  purpose  entities,  nor  have  we  engaged  in  any  derivative
transactions.   Our unconsolidated affiliate  investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale  resort in a manner that minimizes our
initial investment.  Other than the T-Mobile Arena guarantee described below, we have not historically guaranteed financings obtained by our investees. In addition,
there are no other provisions in the agreements with our investees which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had
full ownership of the resort.

In conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company entering into a senior secured credit facility in September 2014, we and AEG each entered into joint and
several completion guarantees for the project, as well as a repayment guarantee for the term loan B (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of a
rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities).   As of December 31, 2015, term loan A was $120 million
and term loan B was $80 million.

Estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 and management’s forecasted LIBOR rates
for our senior credit facility and HIBOR rates for the MGM China credit facility.
The amount for 2016 includes $640 million related to MGM Cotai and $261 million and $15 million related to MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield, respectively.
MGM  National  Harbor  is  being  built  on  land  subject  to  a  long-term  ground  lease.  See  Note  11  to  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further
discussion.
Approximately  $4  million  of  liabilities  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  and  other  tax  liabilities  are  excluded  from  the  table  as  we  cannot  reasonably  estimate  when
examination and other activity related to these amounts will conclude or when these amounts will be paid, if ever.

46

(5)

The amount for 2016 includes $118 million related to employment agreements, $105 million for entertainment agreements and $77 million of open purchase orders.  Other
commitments  include  various  contracted  amounts,  including  information  technology,  advertising,  maintenance  and  other  service  agreements.  Our  largest  entertainment
commitments  consist  of  minimum  contractual payments to  Cirque  du  Soleil,  which  performs  show s at several of our resorts.  Our contractual commitments  for these
shows  generally  do  not  exceed  12  months  and  are  based  on  our  ability  to  exercise  certain  termination  rights;  however,  we  expect  these  shows  to  continue  for  longer
periods.

While we have significant  indebtedness, we believe we have the ability to meet known obligations, including principal  and interest obligations as well as
planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months from the balance sheet date with existing cash and cash deposits, cash flows from operations, dividends
from MGM China, and availability under our senior credit facility, the MGM China credit agreement and the MGM National Harbor credit agreement.  We have
$1.5 billion of maturities of long-term debt in 2016.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Other Factors Affecting Liquidity” for further discussion of anticipated
uses of cash.

Critical
Accounting
Policies
and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements.  To
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.  We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in
areas  we  consider  to  be  critical  accounting  estimates,  where  changes  in  the  estimates  and  assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,
financial position or cash flows.  Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our
critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates.  However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of
uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

Allowance
for
Doubtful
Casino
Accounts
Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts.  In addition, MGM China extends credit to certain
in-house VIP gaming customers and gaming promoters.  Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers
at those casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our other customers who fail to pay their
marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the
mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable
instruments  in the United States  and Macau. At December  31, 2015 and 2014, approximately  37% and 30%, respectively,  of our casino accounts  receivable  was
owed  by  customers  from  the  United  States.  Markers  are  not  legally  enforceable  instruments  in  some  foreign  countries,  but  the  United  States  assets  of  foreign
customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 44% and 54%, respectively, of our
casino accounts receivable  was owed by customers from the Far East. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability,  among other factors, when we
issue credit to customers who are not residents of the United States.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts.  The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating
expense,  increases  the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts.   We  regularly  evaluate  the  allowance  for  doubtful  casino  accounts.    At  resorts  where  marker  play  is  not
significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances.  At resorts where marker play is significant, we
apply  standard  reserve  percentages  to  aged  account  balances  under  a  specified  dollar  amount  and  specifically  analyze  the  collectability  of  each  account  with  a
balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information.

In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in
currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.  Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance
and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

relate  to  MGM  China  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.    The  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  as  a  percentage  of  casino  accounts  receivable  has
increased in the current year due to an increase in specific reserves for high-end gaming customers and an increase in the aging of accounts.  At December 31, 2015,
a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $2.9
million.

Property and equipment are stated at cost.  For the majority of our property and equipment, cost was determined at the acquisition date based on estimated
fair  values  in  connection  with  the  June  2011  MGM  China  acquisition,  the  April  2005  Mandalay  acquisition  and  the  May  2000  Mirage  Resorts
acquisition.    Maintenance  and  repairs  that  neither  materially  add  to  the  value  of  the  property  nor  appreciably  prolong  its  life  are  charged  to  expense  as
incurred.  Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  When we construct assets, we capitalize
direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition,
interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.  Interest is typically capitalized on amounts
expended  on  the  project  using  the  weighted-average  cost  of  our  outstanding  borrowings.    Capitalization  of  interest  starts  when  construction  activities  begin  and
ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We  must  make  estimates  and  assumptions  when  accounting  for  capital  expenditures.    Whether  an  expenditure  is  considered  a  maintenance  expense  or  a
capital asset is a matter of judgment.  When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,
which also may be a matter of judgment.  In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful
lives.  We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset.  Whenever
events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment
of
Long-lived
Assets,
Goodwill
and
Indefinite-lived
Intangible
Assets

We  evaluate  our  property  and  equipment  and  other  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  based  on  our  classification  as  held  for  sale  or  to  be  held  and
used.  Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the
asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.  For assets
to  be  held  and  used,  we  review  for  impairment  whenever  indicators  of  impairment  exist.    We  then  compare  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  of  the  asset,  on  an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.  If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.  If the undiscounted cash
flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset.  For operating assets, fair value is typically measured
using  a discounted  cash  flow  model  whereby  future  cash  flows are  discounted  using  a weighted-average  cost  of  capital,  developed  using  a  standard  capital  asset
pricing  model,  based  on  guideline  companies  in  our  industry.  If  an  asset  is  still  under  development,  future  cash  flows  include  remaining  construction  costs.    All
recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets.  First, management must determine the usage of the
asset.  To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized.  Assets must be tested at the lowest level
for which identifiable cash flows exist.  This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets.  Future cash
flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

48

On  a  quarterly  basis,  we  review  our  major  long-lived  assets  to  determine  if  events  have  occurred  or  circumstances  exist  that  indicate  a  potential  imp
airment.  Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or
economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended us e of the asset group.  We estimate future cash flows using our internal
budgets  and  probability  weight  cash  flows  in  certain  circumstances  to  consider  alternative  outcomes  associated  with  recoverability  of  the  asset  group,  including
potential sale. Histori cally, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual
impairment  test  for  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  and  goodwill  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of
license rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty
method.  See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill represents  the excess  of purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of net assets  acquired  in business combinations.   Goodwill for relevant  reporting
units  is  tested  for  impairment  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  based  on  our  budgeted  future  results  discounted  using  a  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,
developed using a standard capital asset pricing model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, as
well as a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, an indication of impairment exists and we must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any. In measuring an impairment loss, the implied
fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair
value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is
less than its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value.

Due to a significant decrease in MGM China’s cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of MGM China relative to its net book value, we
performed an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015. As of the date we completed our 2015
interim goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our MGM China reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. We therefore concluded that
goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit was not impaired. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill by
reviewing each of our reporting units, including our MGM China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair
value was less than its carrying value by 4%. The decrease in fair value from the interim test valuation date resulted from a further decrease in forecasted cash flows
from our interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further sustained decline in the enterprise value multiples of the MGM China reporting unit as
well as those of the MGM China reporting unit’s peer group. As a result of the indication of impairment from the step one analysis, we proceeded to perform a step
two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss. As such, we determined the current fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its
separately identifiable intangible assets. The current fair values of each of the separately identifiable intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by a
significant amount, leading to a lower implied fair value of goodwill.  Therefore, we recorded a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment charge to reduce the historical
carrying value of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit to its implied fair value.

With  the  exception  of  our  MGM  China  reporting  unit,  as  discussed  above,  none  of  our  other  reporting  units  incurred  any  goodwill  impairment  charges
in 2015, 2014 or 2013. As of the date we completed our 2015 goodwill impairment analysis, the estimated fair values of our wholly owned domestic resorts reporting
units with associated goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values.  As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as
part  of  these  analyses.  If  future  operating  results  of  our  reporting  units  do  not  meet  current  expectations  it  could  cause  carrying  values  of  our  reporting  units  to
exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment.  In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and
actual results may differ materially from our estimates.  In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment
tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Notes 7 and 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of write downs and impairments of goodwill and long-lived

assets.

Impairment
of
Investments
in
Unconsolidated
Affiliates

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our

investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, we

49

compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain o ur investment. We estimate fair value
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates, as well as
a market approach that utilizes business enterpri se value multiples based on a range of multiples in our peer group.  See Note 6 and Note 15 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for discussion of other-than-temporary impairment charges.

Income
Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with
a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.  Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. As of December 31, 2015, the
scheduled future reversal of existing U.S. federal taxable temporary differences exceeds the scheduled future reversal of existing U.S. federal deductible temporary
differences.  Consequently, we no longer apply a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets other than our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset
and a capital loss carryforward.

As of December 31, 2015, we have a foreign tax credit carryover of $2.9 billion against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion based
upon  our  assessment  of  future  realization.    The  foreign  tax  credits  are  attributable  to  the  Macau  Special  Gaming  Tax  which  is  35%  of  gross  gaming  revenue  in
Macau.    Because  MGM  China  is  presently  exempt  from  the  Macau  12%  complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits,  we  believe  that  payment  of  the  Macau  Special
Gaming  Tax  qualifies  as  a  tax  paid  in  lieu  of  an  income  tax  that  is  creditable  against  U.S.  taxes.  Although  MGM  China’s  current  five-year  exemption  from  the
Macau 12% complementary  tax on gaming profits  ends on December  31, 2016, we believe  it will be entitled to receive  a third five-year  exemption from Macau
based upon exemptions granted to its competitors in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires.  For all
periods beyond December 31, 2021, we have assumed that MGM China will be paying the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be
able to credit the Macau Special Gaming Tax in such years and have factored that assumption into our assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred
tax asset.  Furthermore, we do not rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to our history of recent losses in
the U.S. and therefore only rely on U.S. federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.

Our assessment of realization of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability of
and distributions from MGM China, our assumption concerning renewals of the five year exemption from Macau’s 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and
assumptions  concerning  future  U.S.  operating  profits.    As  a  result,  significant  judgment  is  required  in  assessing  the  possible  need  for  a  valuation  allowance  and
changes to our assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of the valuation allowance.  For example, should we in a future period actually receive or be
able to assume an additional five year exemption, an additional valuation allowance would likely need to be provided on some portion or all of the foreign tax credit
deferred tax asset, resulting in an increase in the provision for income taxes in such period and such increase may be material.  In addition, a change to our forecasts
of future profitability of and distributions from MGM China could also result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the
provision for income taxes in such period.

Finally,  we  do  not  currently  rely  on  future  U.S.  source  operating  income  in  assessing  future  foreign  tax  credit  realization  due  to  our  recent  history  of
cumulative losses in the U.S. and therefore only rely on U.S. federal taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit
carryover  period.  However, due to improvements  in our U.S. operations  we have generated  U.S. operating  profits  for the past four consecutive  quarters.   Should
these profits continue in future periods, we may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future U.S. source operating income in our assessment of
the  realizability  of  our  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,  which  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuation  allowance  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in  the
provision for income taxes in such period.  However, the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subject to change on the basis of the
level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.

In addition, there is an $18 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $3 million
on a federal income tax capital loss carryforward, a valuation allowance of $69 million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $1 million
on Hong Kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in
foreign jurisdictions are not material.  Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities.  Positions
taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities.  See Note 10 in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.

50

We  assess  our tax  positions  using a two-step  process.   A tax position  is recognized  if it meets  a “more  likely  than not” threshold,  and  is measured  at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized.  Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date.  Liabilities
we  record  as  a  result  of  this  analysis  are  recorded  separately  from  any  current  or  deferred  income  tax  accounts,  and  are  classified  as  current  in  “Other  accrued
liabilities” or long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment.  Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any,
related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we early adopted on a prospective basis FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, “Balance sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes,” (“ASU 2015-17”), which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2015-17
requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
Prior to adopting ASU 2015-17, we had a current deferred tax liability of $62 million for the period ending December 31, 2014.  Prior periods are not retrospectively
adjusted in the accompanying financial statements.

Stock-based
Compensation

We  account  for  stock  options  and  stock  appreciation  rights  (“SARs”)  measuring  fair  value  using  the  Black-Scholes  model.  For  restricted  share  units
(“RSUs”), compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.  We account for performance stock units (“PSUs”)
measuring fair value using the Monte Carlo valuation model. There are several management assumptions required to determine the inputs into the Black-Scholes
model and Monte Carlo valuation model.  Our volatility and expected term assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model can significantly affect the fair value of
stock options and SARs. The Monte Carlo valuation model also utilizes multiple assumptions, including volatility, to determine the fair value of the award. Changes
in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of share-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the
consolidated financial statements.  The extent of the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any given year.

Market
Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks.  Market risk is the risk of loss arising
from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk
associated with our variable rate long-term debt.  We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings
and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for
fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be
affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.  We do not hold or issue financial
instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

As of December 31, 2015, long-term variable rate borrowings represented approximately 33% of our total borrowings.  Assuming a 100 basis-point increase
in LIBOR (in the case of term loan B, over the 1% floor specified in our senior credit facility), our annual interest cost would change by approximately $27 million
based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in HIBOR for the MGM China credit facility, our annual interest
cost would change by approximately $16 million based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015. The following table provides additional information about
our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly
related  to  MGM  China  and  to  our  operations  at  MGM  Macau  and  the  development  of  MGM  Cotai.  While  recent  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  have  not  been
significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in
these exchange rates. We cannot assure

51

you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the c urrent peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level.  The
possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. As of December 31, 2015, a 1% increase in the
Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our cash balance by $7 million and a
1% decrease in the exchange rate would impact the carrying value of our debt balance by $16 million.

ANNUAL
REPORT

INTERNAL
CONTROL
OVER
FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management’s
Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Sections 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)

of the Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
of
Internal
Control
over
Financial
Reporting

In  establishing  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  management  has  developed  and  maintained  a  system  of  internal  control,  policies  and
procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  contained  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  and  other  information
presented in this annual report is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this annual report.  These include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer
and  principal  financial  officer,  as  appropriate  for  all  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  Significant  elements  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting include, for example:

·

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them appropriately;

· Written accounting policies;
· Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;
·

Segregation of incompatible duties;
Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control; and
Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

·

·

Management’s
Evaluation

Management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

Based on its evaluation as of December 31, 2015, management believes that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in achieving

the objectives described above.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MGM Resorts International

We  have  audited  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  of  MGM  Resorts  International  and  subsidiaries  (the  “Company”)  as  of  December  31,  2015,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission.  The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that
we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material
respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because  of the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the

criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States),  the  consolidated  financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MGM Resorts International

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015
and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on  a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  such  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  MGM  Resorts  International  and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework
(2013)
 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 29, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Organization.
  MGM Resorts International (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through wholly owned
subsidiaries, owns and/or operates casino resorts. The Company owns and operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas,
Nevada:    Bellagio,  MGM  Grand  Las  Vegas,  The  Mirage,  Mandalay  Bay,  Luxor,  New  York-New  York,  Monte  Carlo,  Excalibur  and  Circus  Circus  Las  Vegas.
Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a condominium-hotel consisting of three towers. In April
2015, the Company closed the sale of Railroad Pass and Gold Strike which included related assets in Jean, Nevada. In November 2015, the Company closed the sale
of Circus Circus Reno as well as the Company’s 50% interest in Silver Legacy and associated real property, with Eldorado Resorts, Inc. See Note 4 for additional
discussion of dispositions. Along with local investors, the Company owns and operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The Company owns and operates
the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica.  The Company also owns Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course
located  approximately  ten  miles  north  of  its  Las  Vegas  Strip  resorts,  Primm  Valley  Golf  Club  at  the  California/Nevada  state  line  and  Fallen  Oak  golf  course  in
Saucier, Mississippi.

The Company owns 51% and has a controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM
Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions, and is
in the process of developing an 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort
with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to
MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation may be less than MGM Cotai’s 500 gaming table capacity. The total
estimated project budget is $3.0 billion excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

The Company owns 50% of and manages CityCenter, located between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The other 50% of CityCenter is owned by Infinity World
Development Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter consists of Aria, an integrated
casino, hotel and entertainment resort; Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, a non-gaming boutique hotel; Crystals, a retail, dining and entertainment district; and Vdara, a
luxury condominium-hotel. In addition, CityCenter features residential units in the Residences at Mandarin Oriental and Veer.  See Note 6, Note 11 and Note 17 for
additional information related to CityCenter.

The Company owns 50% of the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa (“Borgata”) located on Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Boyd Gaming Corporation owns the other 50% of Borgata and also operates the resort.  The Company also has a 50% interest in Grand Victoria. Grand Victoria is a
riverboat  casino  in  Elgin,  Illinois;  an  affiliate  of  Hyatt  Gaming  owns  the  other  50%  of  Grand  Victoria  and  also  operates  the  resort.    See  Note  6  for  additional
information regarding the Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission has awarded the Company’s subsidiary developing MGM National Harbor a license to build and
operate a destination integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort in Prince George’s County at National Harbor, which is a waterfront development located on
the  Potomac  River  just  outside  of  Washington  D.C.  The  expected  cost  to  develop  and  construct  MGM  National  Harbor  is  approximately  $1.3  billion,  excluding
capitalized interest and land related costs.  The Company expects the resort to include a casino with approximately 3,600 slots and 160 table games including poker;
a 300-room hotel with luxury spa and rooftop pool; 93,100 square feet of high-end branded retail and fine and casual dining; a dedicated 3,000 seat theater venue;
50,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 4,700-space parking garage.

A subsidiary of the Company was awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be
developed  on  approximately  14  acres  of  land  in  downtown  Springfield,  Massachusetts.    The  Company’s  plans  for  the  resort  currently  include  a  casino  with
approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting
and  event  space;  and  a  3,375  space  parking  garage,  with  an  expected  development  and  construction  cost  of  approximately  $865  million,  excluding  capitalized
interest and land related costs.

In 2013, the Company formed Las Vegas Arena Company, LLC (the “Las Vegas Arena Company”) with a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.
(“AEG”) – a leader  in sports,  entertainment,  and  promotions  –  to design,  construct,  and  operate  an  arena  that  will be  located  on a parcel  of the  Company’s land
between Frank Sinatra Drive and New York-New York, adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. The Company and AEG each own 50% of Las Vegas Arena Company. Such
development is estimated to cost

72

approximately $350 million, excluding capitalized interest and land-related costs.  The Las Vegas Arena Company recently entered into a multi-year naming rights
agreement with T-Mobile.  T-Mobile Arena is anticipated to seat between 18,000-2 0,000 people.   In addition, the Company is building The Park entertainment
district  which  connects  to  New  York-New  York,  Monte  Carlo  and  T-Mobile  Arena.  Also,  effective  January  1,  2016,  the  Las  Vegas  Arena  Company  leases  and
operates the MGM Grand Garden Arena under a long term lease with an initial 15-year term, plus two 5-year renewal options. See Note 6 and Note 11 for additional
information related to Las Vegas Arena Company.

The Company has two reportable segments: wholly owned domestic resorts and MGM China. See Note 16 for additional information about the Company’s

segments.

NOTE

BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles
of
consolidation.
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company’s investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates  which  are  50%  or  less  owned  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method.    The  Company  does  not  have  significant  variable  interests  in
variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
  Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates,  cost  method  investments,  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  an  acquisition,  and  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  Fair  value
measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that
includes:  Level  1  inputs,  such  as  quoted  prices  in  an  active  market;  Level  2  inputs,  which  are  observable  inputs  for  similar  assets;  or  Level  3  inputs,  which  are
unobservable inputs.

·

·

·

The Company uses Level 1 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;
The Company used Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of its investment in Grand Victoria. See Note 6; and
The Company used Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when measuring the impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit, See Note 7.

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
  Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of
acquisition.    Such  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.    Book  overdraft  balances  resulting  from  the  Company’s  cash  management
program are recorded as accounts payable, construction payable, or other accrued liabilities, as applicable.

Cash
deposits
–
original
maturities
longer
than
90
days.
At December 31, 2014, the Company had $570 million in certificates of deposit with original

maturities longer than 90 days. Scheduled maturities were at or prior to March 31, 2015. The fair value of the certificates of deposit equaled their carrying value.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino
accounts  receivable.    The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  of
creditworthiness.  At December 31, 2015, 63% of the Company’s casino receivables were due from customers residing in foreign countries.  Business or economic
conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost.  Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be
uncollectible.  Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received.  An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the
Company’s  receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.    The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customer
accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2015, no significant
concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.

73

Inventories.
    Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or
market.  Cost is determi ned primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies.  Cost for retail merchandise is determined using
the cost method.

Property
and
equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost.  A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through
business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.  Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the
determination of income or loss.  Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued $17 million and $14
million for property and equipment within accounts payable and $44 million and $24 million related to construction retention accrued in other long-term liabilities,
respectively.

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

20 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 20 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and
used.  Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the
asset  at a reasonable  price  in relation  to its fair  value  and is actively  seeking  a buyer. For assets held for sale,  the Company recognizes  the  asset at the lower of
carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.  For assets to be
held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the
asset,  on an undiscounted  basis, to the  carrying  value  of the  asset.   If the undiscounted  cash flows  exceed  the carrying  value,  no impairment  is  indicated.   If the
undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted
cash flow model.  If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.  All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets
held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.  See Note 15 for information on recorded impairment charges.

Capitalized
interest.
 The  interest  cost  associated  with  major  development  and  construction  projects  is  capitalized  and  included  in  the  cost  of  the
project.    When  no  debt  is  incurred  specifically  for  a  project,  interest  is  capitalized  on  amounts  expended  on  the  project  using  the  weighted-average  cost  of  the
Company’s outstanding borrowings.  Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a
brief period.

Investments
in
and
advances
to
unconsolidated
affiliates.
 The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equity
method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences,
as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment
and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as
gains  and  impairments  related  to  its  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  as  a  component  of  operating  income  or  loss,  as  the  Company’s  investments  in  such
unconsolidated affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of
the  investment  to  its  carrying  value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines  whether  the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary”  based  on  its
assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a
discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that
utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.  See Note 6 for results of the Company’s review of its
investment in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates.

Goodwill
and
other
intangible
assets.
    Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business
combinations.    Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain
circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.  An impairment of goodwill related to the MGM China
reporting unit was recorded as a result of the annual impairment review in 2015. No impairments were indicated or recorded in 2014 and 2013.  See Note 7.

74

Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the Company’s
reporting  units  discounted  using  market  discount  rates  and  market  indicators  of  terminal  year  capitalization  rates,  and  a  market  approach  that  utilizes  business
enterprise value  multiples  based  on  a  range  of  multiples  from  the  Company’s  peer  group.    If  the  carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  an
indication of impairment exists and the Company must proceed to measure an impairment loss, if any.  To me asure an impairment loss, the implied fair value of a
reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit to its assets and liabi lities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of goodwill.  If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its
carrying value then it must be written down to its implied fair value. License rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks
are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method.  If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment
loss is recognized equal to the differe nce.

Revenue
recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
    Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilities
recognized  for  funds  deposited  by  customers  before  gaming  play  occurs  (“casino  front  money”)  and  for  chips  in  the  customers’  possession  (“outstanding  chip
liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided.  Advance
deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer.

Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs.  The retail value of hotel
rooms, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances.  The
estimated cost of providing promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Gaming
promoters.
A significant portion of the high-end (“VIP”) gaming volume at MGM Macau is generated through the use of gaming promoters, also
known as junket operators. These operators introduce high-end gaming players to MGM Macau, assist these customers with travel arrangements, and extend gaming
credit  to  these  players.  VIP  gaming  at  MGM  Macau  is  conducted  by  the  use  of  special  purpose  nonnegotiable  gaming  chips.  Gaming  promoters  purchase  these
nonnegotiable chips from MGM Macau and in turn sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow MGM Macau to track the amount of wagering
conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play volume, or rolling chip turnover, which is the amount of nonnegotiable chips
wagered  and  lost.  In  exchange  for  the  gaming  promoters’  services,  MGM  Macau  compensates  the  gaming  promoters  through  revenue-sharing  arrangements  or
rolling chip turnover-based commissions. The estimated portion of the gaming promoter commissions that represent amounts passed through to VIP customers is
recorded as a reduction of casino revenue, and the estimated portion retained by the gaming promoter for its compensation is recorded as casino expense.

Reimbursed
expenses.
    The  Company  recognizes  costs  reimbursed  pursuant  to  management  services  as  revenue  in  the  period  it  incurs  the

costs.  Reimbursed costs related primarily to the Company’s management of CityCenter.

Loyalty
programs.

The Company’s primary loyalty program is “M life” and is available to patrons at substantially all of the Company’s wholly owned and
operated resorts and CityCenter. Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the M
life front desk at participating properties.  Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the
points earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed, and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue.
Customers also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can be redeemed for complimentary goods and services, including hotel rooms, food and
beverage,  and  entertainment.  The  Company  records  a  liability  for  the  estimated  costs  of  providing  goods  and  services  for  Express  Comps  based  on  the  Express
Comps  earned  multiplied  by  a  cost  margin,  less  an  estimate  for  Express  Comps  not  expected  to  be  redeemed  and  records  a  corresponding  expense  in  the  casino
department. MGM Macau also has a loyalty program, whereby patrons earn rewards that can be redeemed for complimentary services, including hotel rooms, food
and beverage, and entertainment.

Advertising.
   The  Company  expenses  advert  ising  costs  the  first  time  the  advertising  takes  place.    Advertising  expense,  which  is  generally  included  in

general and administrative expenses, was $156 million for 2015 and 2014 and $153 million for 2013.

Corporate
expense.
  Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll, aircraft costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
Company’s  casino  resort  operations.    In  addition,  corporate  expense  includes  the  costs  associated  with  the  Company’s  evaluation  and  pursuit  of  new  business
opportunities, which are expensed as incurred.

Preopening
and
start-up
expenses.
  Preopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred.  Costs classified as preopening

and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.

Property
transactions,
net.

The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on

the sale of assets as “Property transactions, net.”  See Note 15 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Redeemable
noncontrolling
interest.

In April 2015, MGM National Harbor issued non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor (“Interests”)
to  Radio  One,  Inc.  (“Radio  One”),  a  noncontrolling  interest  party,  for  a  purchase  price  of  $5  million.  In  addition,  Radio  One  was  given  the  right  to  make  one
additional capital contribution of up to $35 million prior to July 1, 2016 for the purchase of additional Interests.  In December 2015, MGM National Harbor issued
Interests to 42 Gaming N.H., LLC (“42 Gaming”), a noncontrolling interest party, for a purchase price of $1.25 million. In addition, 42 Gaming was given the right
to make one additional capital contribution of up to $8.75 million prior to July 1, 2016 for the purchase of additional Interests.

The  Interests  provide  for  annual  preferred  distributions  by  MGM  National  Harbor  to  Radio  One and  42  Gaming  based  on  a  percentage  of  its  annual  net
gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions will begin within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year in
which the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs, and after the end of each subsequent fiscal year. Also, beginning on the third anniversary of the last day of
the calendar quarter in which the opening date of MGM National Harbor occurs (and on each subsequent anniversary thereof) Radio One and 42 Gaming will each
have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their Interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.
Radio One and 42 Gaming also each have the right to sell back all or a portion of their Interests prior to such date if MGM National Harbor were to guarantee or
grant liens to secure any indebtedness of the Company or its affiliates other than the indebtedness of MGM National Harbor.

The  Company  has  recorded  the  Interests  as  “Redeemable  noncontrolling  interests”  in  the  mezzanine  section  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets  and  not  stockholders’  equity  because  their  redemption  is  not  exclusively  in  the  Company’s  control.  Interests  are  initially  accounted  for  at  fair  value.
Subsequently, the Company will recognize changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests
to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company will
reflect any changes caused by such an adjustment in retained earnings or accumulated deficit.

excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as their effect would be antidilutive.

Currency
translation.
 The  Company  translates  the  financial  statements  of  foreign  subsidiaries  that  are  not  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.    Balance  sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).

Comprehensive
income
(loss).
 Comprehensive  income  (loss)  includes  net  income  (loss)  and  all  other  non-stockholder  changes  in  equity,  or  other
comprehensive income (loss). Elements of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
No.  2016-02,  “Leases  (Topic  842),”  (“ASU  2016-02”),  which  replaces  the  existing  guidance  in  Accounting  Standard  Codification  840,  Leases.  ASU  2016-02  is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting
under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a
right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and
for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will
have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In  August  2015,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2015-14,  “Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers  (Topic  606):  Deferral  of  the
Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” (“ASU 2014-09”) to the
fiscal  year,  and interim  periods  within  the year,  beginning  on or  after  December  15, 2017. FASB ASU 2014-09 outlines  a  new, single  comprehensive  model  for
entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. Additionally, the new model will
require  revenue  recognition  to  depict  the  transfer  of  promised  goods  or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  a  company  expects  to
receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements and footnote disclosures.

In  July  2015, the  FASB issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No. 2015-11,  “Simplifying  the  Measurement  of  Inventory,”  (“ASU 2015-11”),  effective  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out  (FIFO) or average  cost method to be measured  “at the lower of cost and net realizable  value,” thereby simplifying  the current  guidance  under which an
entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures). ASU No. 2015-11 will not apply
to inventories that are measured by using either the LIFO method or the retail inventory method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of
ASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,” (“ASU 2015-02”), which is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU 2015-02 amends: the assessment of whether a limited
partnership is a variable interest entity; the effect that fees paid to a decision maker have on the consolidation analysis; how variable interests held by a reporting
entity’s related parties or de facto agents affect its consolidation conclusion; and for entities other than limited partnerships, clarifies how to determine whether the
equity holders as a

77

gr oup have power over an entity. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and footnote
disclosures.

During 2015, the Company early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU 2015-
03”), which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent
with the presentation of a debt discount. The amortization of such costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In addition, in accordance with ASU No.
2015-15,  “Presentation  and  Subsequent  Measurement  of  Debt  Issuance  Costs  Associated  with  Line-of-Credit  Arrangements:  Amendments  to  SEC  Paragraph
Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,” (“ASU 2015-15”), which was adopted concurrent with ASU 2015-03, the Company will continue
to present the debt issuance costs associated with the Company's revolving credit facilities as other assets included within the Company's consolidated balance sheets
and continue amortizing those deferred costs over the term of the related facilities. ASU 2015-03 requires the new guidance to be applied on a retrospective basis.
Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company reclassified $118 million and $109 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  early  adopted  on  a  prospective  basis  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2015-17,  “Balance  Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes,” (“ASU 2015-17”).  ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets, along with any related valuation allowance, be
classified  as noncurrent  in  a  classified  statement  of  financial  position.  The  amendments  in  ASU 2015-17  may  be  applied  on either  a  prospective  or  retrospective
basis. The Company had a current deferred tax liability of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective
basis, and accordingly the prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements.

DISPOSITIONS
AND
ASSETS

FOR
SALE

On April 1, 2015, the Company closed the sale of Railroad Pass. At closing, the Company received $8 million in cash proceeds. The assets and liabilities of
Railroad  Pass  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  as  of  December  31,  2014.   At December  31, 2014, assets  held for  sale  of  $9 million,  comprised  predominantly  of
property, plant and equipment, were classified within “Prepaid expenses and other”  and  liabilities related to assets held for sale of $2 million, comprised of accounts
payable and other accrued liabilities, were classified  within “Other accrued liabilities.”

On April 30, 2015, the Company  closed the sale of  Gold Strike and related assets in Jean, Nevada.  At closing, the Company received $12 million in cash
proceeds .  The assets and liabilities of Gold Strike were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014.   At December 31, 2014, assets held for sale of  $14
million comprised predominantly of property, plant and equipment, were classified within “Prepaid expenses and other”  and  liabilities related to assets held for sale
of $2 million, comprised of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, were classified  within “Other accrued liabilities.”

On July 7, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Eldorado Resorts, Inc. to sell Circus Circus Reno, as well as the Company’s 50% interest in
Silver Legacy and associated real property.  On November 23, 2015, the Company closed the sale and received $80 million in cash proceeds and recorded a gain of
$23 million  related to the sale, classified  within “Property transactions,  net.”  See Note 6 for further  discussion of the sale of the Company’s 50% investment in
Silver Legacy.

Railroad Pass, Gold Strike and Circus Circus Reno were not classified as discontinued  operations because the Company concluded that the sales did not

have a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and they do not represent a disposal of a major geographic segment or product line.

CityCenter
litigation
settlement.
 In December 2014, the Company and CityCenter entered into a settlement agreement with Perini Building Company, Inc.
(“Perini”), general contractor for CityCenter, the remaining Perini subcontractors and relevant insurers to resolve all outstanding project lien claims and CityCenter’s
counterclaims relating to the Harmon Hotel and Spa. The settlement was subject to execution of a global settlement agreement among the parties described above,
which was subsequently executed, and CityCenter’s procurement of replacement general liability insurance covering construction of the CityCenter development,
which was obtained in January 2015. The proceeds pursuant to such global settlement agreement, combined with certain prior Harmon-related insurance settlement
proceeds, resulted in a gain of $160 million recorded by CityCenter during the first quarter of 2015, of which the Company recorded its 50% share of $80 million.

CityCenter
distribution.
 In April 2015, CityCenter adopted an annual distribution policy and declared a special distribution of $400 million, of which the
Company  received  its  50%  share  of  $200  million.  Under  the  annual  distribution  policy,  CityCenter  will  distribute  up  to  35%  of  excess  cash  flow,  subject  to  the
approval of the CityCenter board of directors.

October
2013
debt
restructuring
transactions.
 In October 2013, CityCenter entered into a $1.775 billion senior secured credit facility. The senior secured

credit facility consists of a $75 million revolving facility maturing in October 2018, and a $1.7 billion term

79

loan B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility was issued at 99% of the principal amount and bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBOR
f loor  of  1.00%.  Concurrent  with  the  closing  of  the  new  senior  secured  credit  facility,  CityCenter  issued  a  notice  of  full  redemption  with  respect  to  its  existing
7.625% senior secured first lien notes and 10.75%/11.50% senior secured second lien PIK toggle notes and discharged each of the indentures for its first and second
lien notes at a premium in accordance with the terms of such indentures. As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a charge of $70 million for its share of
CityCenter’s non-ope rating loss on retirement of long-term debt, primarily consisting of premiums associated with the redemption of the existing first and second
lien notes as well as the write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs. CityCenter permanently repaid $ 38 million and $154 million of its term loan B
facility in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In addition, in connection with the October 2013 debt restructuring, sponsor notes with a carrying value of approximately $738 million were converted to
members’  equity.  Subsequent  to  these  transactions,  CityCenter’s  senior  credit  facility  is  its  only  remaining  long-term  debt.    The  senior  secured  credit  facility  is
secured by substantially all the assets of CityCenter, and contains certain financial covenants including minimum interest coverage ratios and maximum leverage
ratio requirements (as defined in the CityCenter agreements).

Grand
Victoria

At December 31, 2015, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its Grand Victoria investment for impairment due to a greater than anticipated decline in
operating results due in part to a continued loss of market share to video gaming terminals, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows compared to the prior
forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value from a market
participant’s  viewpoint.  Key  assumptions  included  in  the  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  were  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  including  outflows  for  capital
expenditures, a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business enterprise
value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it was necessary to
record an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $17 million at December 31, 2015, based on an estimated fair value of $123 million for the Company’s 50%
interest.  The  Company  intends  to,  and  believes  it  will  be  able  to,  retain  the  investment  in  Grand  Victoria;  however,  due  to  the  extent  of  the  shortfall  and  the
Company’s assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering its investment, the Company has determined that the impairment was other-than-temporary.

At  June  30,  2014,  the  Company  reviewed  the  carrying  value  of  its  Grand  Victoria  investment  for  impairment  due  to  a  greater  than  anticipated  decline  in
operating results and loss of market share due to the proliferation of video gaming terminals in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows
compared to the prior forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair
value from a market participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows
for capital expenditures, a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 10.5%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business
enterprise value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it was
necessary to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $29 million at June 30, 2014, based on an estimated fair value of $140 million for the Company’s
50% interest.

At  June  30,  2013,  the  Company  reviewed  the  carrying  value  of  its  Grand  Victoria  investment  for  impairment  due  to  a  greater  than  anticipated  decline  in
operating results and loss of market share as a result of the opening of a new river boat casino in the Illinois market, as well as a decrease in forecasted cash flows
compared to the prior forecast. The Company used a blended discounted cash flow analysis and guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair
value from a market participant’s viewpoint. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimates of future cash flows including outflows
for capital expenditures, a long-term growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 11%. Key assumptions in the guideline public company method included business
enterprise value multiples selected based on the range of multiples in Grand Victoria’s peer group. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined that it was
necessary to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $37 million based on an estimated fair value of $170 million for the Company’s 50% interest.

Las
Vegas
Arena
Company

In September 2014, a wholly owned subsidiary of Las Vegas Arena Company entered into a senior secured credit facility to finance construction of the T-
Mobile  Arena.  In  connection  with  this  senior  credit  facility,  MGM  Resorts  International  and  AEG  each  entered  into  a  repayment  guarantee  for  the  term  loan  B
(which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities).
As of December 31, 2015, the senior secured credit facility consisted of a $120 million term loan A and an $80 million term loan B. The senior secured credit facility
matures in October 2016, with an option to extend the maturity for three years. The senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the Las
Vegas  Arena  Company,  and  contains  certain  financial  covenants  applicable  upon  opening  of  the  T-Mobile  Arena.  I  n  accordance  with  the  Las  Vegas  Arena
Company’s senior secured credit facility, the Company and AEG contributed equal amounts

80

totaling $175 million for construction, all of which has been contributed as of December 31, 2015. See Note 11 f or discussion of the Company’s joint and several
completion and repayment guarantees and equity contribution commitments related to the Las Vegas Arena Company.

Silver
Legacy

As discussed in Note 4, the Company closed the sale of its 50% interest in Silver Legacy on November 23, 2015, received proceeds of $58 million, and
recorded a gain of $20 million. The Company’s investment in Silver Legacy was not classified as discontinued operations because the Company has concluded that
the  sale  will  not  have  a  major  effect  on  the  Company’s  operations  or  its  financial  results  and  it  does  not  represent  a  disposal  of  a  major  geographic  segment  or
product line.

Basis
Differences

The  Company’s investments  in unconsolidated  affiliates  do not  equal  the  Company’s  share  of  venture-level  equity  due  to various  basis differences.  Basis
differences  related  to  depreciable  assets  are  being  amortized  based  on  the  useful  lives  of  the  related  assets  and  liabilities  and  basis  differences  related  to  non–
depreciable assets, such as land and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are not being amortized. Differences between the Company’s share of venture-level equity and
investment balances are as follows:

Goodwill related  to wholly owned domestic  resorts  relates  to the acquisition  of Mirage  Resorts in 2001 and the acquisition  of Mandalay Resort Group in

2005.   The Company recognized goodwill resulting from its acquisition of a controlling interest in MGM China in 2011.

Due to a significant decrease in MGM China’s cash flows as well as a decline in the market capitalization of MGM China relative to its net book value, the
Company performed an interim impairment test of goodwill related to the MGM China reporting unit in the second quarter of 2015.  The results of the Company’s
interim impairment test indicated the fair value of the MGM China reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  conducted  its  annual  impairment  tests  of  goodwill  by  reviewing  each  of  its  reporting  units,  including  its
MGM China reporting unit. The step one goodwill analysis of the MGM China reporting unit indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value by 4%.  The
decrease in fair value from the interim test valuation date resulted from a

83

further decrease in forecasted cash flows from the interim analysis based on current market conditions and a further and sus tained decline in the enterprise value
multiples of the MGM China reporting unit as well as the multiples of the reporting unit’s peer group.

As a result of the indication of impairment from its step one analysis, the Company performed a step two impairment analysis to measure the impairment loss.
As such, the Company determined the current fair values of all assets of the MGM China reporting unit, including its separately identifiable intangible assets. The
current  fair  values  of  each  of  the  separately  identifiable  intangible  assets  exceeded  their  respective  carrying  values  by  a  significant  amount,  leading  to  a  lower
implied  fair  value  of  goodwill.  Therefore,  the  Company  recorded  a  $1.5  billion  non-cash  impairment  charge  to  reduce  the  historical  carrying  value  of  goodwill
related  to  the  MGM  China  reporting  unit  to  its  implied  fair  value.  The  impairment  charge  is  reflected  in  “Property  transactions,  net”  in  the  accompanying
Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015.  The  carrying  value  of  goodwill  related  to  the  MGM  China  reporting  unit  as  of
December 31, 2015 following the impairment charge was $1.4 billion.

The Company’s  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets consist  primarily  of development  rights in Detroit, trademarks  and license  rights,  of which $210 million

consists of trademarks and trade names related to the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition.

MGM
Grand
Paradise
gaming
subconcession.
  Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos de
Macau, S.A., a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of
15 years commencing on April 20, 2005. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the original terms of
the  agreement;  however,  management  believes  that  the  gaming  subconcession  will  be  extended,  given  that  the  land  concession  agreement  with  the  government
extends significantly beyond the gaming subconcession. In addition, management believes that the fair value of MGM China reflected in the IPO pricing suggests
that  market  participants  have  assumed  the  gaming  subconcession  will  be  extended  beyond  its  initial  term.  As  such,  the  Company  was  amortizing  the  gaming
subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the land concession through April 6, 2031.  In January 2013, the Company’s Cotai land
concession  was  gazetted  by  the  Macau  government  at  which  time  the  Company  determined  that  the  estimated  remaining  useful  life  of  its  gaming  subconcession
would be extended through the initial 25-year term of the Cotai land concession, ending in January 2038.

MGM
Macau
land
concession.
MGM Grand Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencing
from April 6, 2006.  The land use right has an initial term through April 6, 2031, subject to renewal for additional periods. The land concession intangible asset is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial contractual term.

MGM
China
customer
lists.
 The  Company  recognized  an  intangible  asset  related  to  customer  lists,  which  is  amortized  on  an  accelerated  basis  over  its

estimated useful life of five years.

MGM
China
gaming
promoter
relationships.

The Company recognized an intangible asset related to its relationships with gaming promoters, which was

amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of four years.  The gaming promoter relationship intangible asset became fully amortized in 2015.

Maryland
license.

The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Maryland.  The consideration paid to the State of Maryland for the license fee

of $22 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casino resort.

Massachusetts
license.

The Company was granted a license to operate a casino in Massachusetts.  The consideration paid to the State of Massachusetts for
the license fee of $85 million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that will be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning upon the opening of the casino
resort.

Other.

 The  Company’s  other  finite–lived  intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  lease  acquisition  costs  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  related  leases,  and

certain license rights amortized over their contractual life.

84

Total amortization expense related to intangible assets was $1 99 million, $232 million and $243 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Estimated

Senior
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2015, the Company’s senior credit facility consisted of a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, a $1.02 billion term
loan A facility and a $1.70 billion term loan B facility. The revolving and term loan A facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable rate determined by the
Company’s  credit  rating  (2.75%  as  of  December  31,  2015).  The  term  loan  B  facility  bears  interest  at  LIBOR  plus  2.50%,  with  a  LIBOR  floor  of  1.00%.  The
revolving and term loan A facilities mature in December 2017 and the term loan B facility matures in December 2019. The term loan A and term loan B facilities are
subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal balance. The Company
permanently repaid $28 million in 2015, in accordance with the scheduled amortization. The Company had $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under its
senior  credit  facility  at December  31, 2015. At December  31, 2015, the interest  rate on the term loan A was 3.17% and the interest  rate on the term  loan B was
3.50%.

86

The land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas, Bellagio and The Mirage secure up to $3.35 billion of obliga tions outstanding under
the senior credit facility.  In addition, the land and substantially  all of the assets of New York-New York and Gold Strike Tunica secure the entire amount of the
senior credit facility, and the land and substantially all of the asse ts of MGM Grand Detroit secure its $450 million of obligations as a co-borrower under the senior
credit facility. In addition, the senior credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that o wn the pledged
properties.

The senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. In addition, the senior credit
facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (the “Restricted Group”) to maintain a minimum trailing four-quarter EBITDA (as defined in the senior
credit  facility)  and  limits  the  ability  of  the  Restricted  Group  to  make  capital  expenditures  and  investments.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  the  Restricted  Group  is
required to maintain a minimum EBITDA of $1.30 billion. The minimum EBITDA requirement increases to $1.35 billion for March 31, 2016 through December 31,
2016, and to $1.40 billion for March 31, 2017 and thereafter. EBITDA for the trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2015, calculated in accordance with the
terms of the senior credit facility (which includes cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, such as the CityCenter distribution), was $1.71 billion. The senior
credit facility limits the Restricted Group to capital expenditures of $500 million per fiscal year, with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next fiscal
year, but not any fiscal year thereafter.  The Restricted Group’s total capital expenditures allowable under the senior credit facility for fiscal year 2015, after giving
effect to unused amounts from 2014, was $794 million. In addition, the senior credit facility limits the Restricted Group’s ability to make investments subject to
certain thresholds and other important exceptions. As of December 31, 2015, the Restricted Group was within the limit of capital expenditures and other investments
for the 2015 calendar year.

The  senior  credit  facility  provides  for  customary  events  of  default,  including,  without  limitation,  (i)  payment  defaults,  (ii)  covenant  defaults,  (iii)  cross-
defaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, (iv) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (v) judgment defaults in excess of specified
amounts, (vi) the failure of any loan document by a significant party to be in full force and effect and such circumstance, in the reasonable judgment of the required
lenders, is materially  adverse to the lenders, or (vii) the security documents cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien on any material portion of the
collateral. In addition, the senior credit facility provides that a cessation of business due to revocation, suspension or loss of any gaming license affecting a specified
amount of its revenues or assets, will constitute an event of default.

MGM
China
credit
facility.
 In  June  2015,  MGM  China  and  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  as  co-borrowers,  entered  into  a  second  amended  and  restated  credit
facility which consists of $1.55 billion of term loans and a $1.45 billion revolving credit facility. The term was extended for an eighteen month period to April 2019,
with scheduled amortization payments of the term loans beginning in October 2017. The MGM China credit facility bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum
based on HIBOR plus a margin that will range between 1.375% and 2.50% based on MGM China’s leverage ratio. The MGM China credit facility is secured by
MGM Grand Paradise’s interest in the Cotai land use right, and MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise and their guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest
in substantially all of their assets to secure the facility. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2015 was comprised solely of term loans.  At December 31, 2015,
weighted average interest rate on the term loans was 1.97%.

The MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, which
impose restrictions on, among other things, the ability of MGM China and its subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends and sell assets, and to incur additional
liens. As of December 31, 2015, MGM China was required to maintain compliance with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 in addition to a minimum interest
coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00. MGM China was in compliance with the credit facility covenants at December 31, 2015.

In February 2016, the MGM China credit facility was amended. The amendment included changes to the required maximum leverage ratio which increases to
6.00 to 1.00 beginning September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2017, then decreases to 5.50 to 1.00 for September 30, 2017, 5.00 to 1.00 for December 31, 2017, and
4.50 to 1.00 for March 31, 2018 and thereafter.

MGM
National
Harbor
credit
agreement.
 In  January  2016,  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC,  the  Company’s  wholly  owned  subsidiary  developing  and
constructing MGM National Harbor, entered into a credit agreement consisting of a $100 million revolving credit facility and a $425 million delayed draw term loan
facility, of which $250 million was funded at closing . The revolving and term loan facilities initially bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus an additional rate ranging
from 2.00% to 2.25% per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio) . The term loan facilities are subject to scheduled amortization payments on the last day
of each calendar quarter beginning the fourth full fiscal quarter following the opening date of MGM National Harbor, initially in an amount equal to 1.25% of the
aggregate principal balance and increasing to 1.875% and 2.50% of the aggregate principal balance on the last day of the twelfth and sixteenth full fiscal quarter,
respectively. The term loan and revolving facilities are scheduled to mature in January 2021.

The credit agreement is secured by a leasehold mortgage on MGM National Harbor and substantially all of the existing and future property of MGM National

Harbor. Mandatory prepayments will be required upon the occurrence of certain events, including

87

sales of certain assets, casualt y events and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In addition, to the
extent MGM National Harbor generates excess cash flow (as defined), a percentage of such excess cash flow (ranging fr om 0% to 50% based on a total leverage
ratio) will be required to be used to prepay the term loan facilities commencing with the fiscal year ended 2017.

The  credit  agreement  contains  customary  representations  and  warranties,  events  of  default,  affirmative  covenants  and  negative  covenants,  which  impose
restrictions on, among other things, the ability of MGM National Harbor, LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to make investments, pay dividends, sell assets, and to
incur  additional  debt  and  additional  liens.  In  addition,  the  credit  agreement  requires  MGM  National  Harbor,  LLC  and  its  restricted  subsidiaries  to  maintain  a
maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a customary “in balance test”
(as defined in the credit agreement), which requires that, as of the date of determination prior to the opening date, the available funds (including resources that may
be available from the Company under the Company’s senior credit facility) are equal to or exceed the remaining costs for MGM National Harbor.

Senior
Notes.
During 2015, the Company repaid its $875 million 6.625% senior notes at maturity.  In 2014, the Company repaid its $509 million 5.875%
senior notes at maturity and issued $1.25 billion of 6% senior notes due 2023 for net proceeds of $1.24 billion. The senior notes are unsecured and otherwise rank
equally in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and
future secured obligations, primarily consisting of its senior credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations.

Convertible
senior
notes.
  In April 2015, holders of substantially all of the $1.45 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes
elected to convert the notes into approximately 78 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The notes were converted at 53.83 shares of common stock per
$1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $18.58 per share. In addition, the Company settled the capped call transactions
entered into in connection with the initial issuance of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes and received approximately 6 million shares from such
financial institutions. Such shares received in connection with the capped call transactions were subsequently retired.

Maturities

Income  generated  from  gaming  operations  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise,  which  is  wholly  owned  by  MGM  China,  is  exempted  from  Macau’s  12%
complementary tax for the five-year period ending December 31, 2016, pursuant to approval from the Macau government in 2011.  Absent this exemption, “Net loss
attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have increased by $25 million and $47 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and net loss per share (diluted)
would have increased by $0.04 and $0.10 for 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The approval granted in 2011 represented the second five-year exemption period granted
to MGM Grand Paradise.  The Company measures the net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise under the assumption that it will receive an additional five-
year  exemption  beyond  2016.    Such  assumption  is  based  upon  the  granting  of  a  third  five-year  exemption  to  competitors  of  MGM  Grand  Paradise.    While  no
assurance can be given, the Company believes MGM Grand Paradise should also be entitled to a third five-year exemption in order to ensure non-discriminatory
treatment among gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires, a requirement under Macanese law.  The net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise was re-
measured during the first quarter of 2013 due to the extension of the amortization period of the Macau gaming subconcession in connection with the effectiveness of
the Cotai land concession.  This resulted in an increase in the net deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase in provision for income taxes of $65 million in
2013.

Non-gaming  operations  remain  subject  to  the  Macau  complementary  tax.    MGM  Grand  Paradise  had  at  December  31,  2015  a  complementary  tax  net
operating loss carryforward of $571 million resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2016 through
2018.

MGM Grand Paradise’s exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to

MGM China.  However, MGM Grand Paradise has entered into an agreement with the Macau

90

government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat
annual  payment  (“annual  fee  arrangement”)  regardless  of  the  amount  of  distributable  dividends.    Such  annual  fee  arrangement  is  effective  until  December  31,
2016. MGM China is not subject to the complementary tax on distributions it receives during the covered period as a result of the annual fee arrangement. Annual
payments  of  $  2 million  are  required  under  the  annual  fee  arrangement.    The  $  2 million  annual  payment  for  2015  and  2014  was  accrued  and  a  corresponding
provision for income taxes wa s recorded in each year.

The Company repatriated $304 million and $390 million of foreign earnings and profits in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  At December 31, 2015, there are
approximately  $178  million  of  unrepatriated  foreign  earnings  and  profits,  all  of  which  the  Company  anticipates  will  be  repatriated  without  the  incurrence  of
additional  U.S.  income  tax  expense.    Accordingly,  no  deferred  tax  liability  has  been  recorded  for  those  earnings.    Creditable  foreign  taxes  associated  with  the
repatriated earnings and profits increased the Company’s foreign tax credit carryover by $318 million and $782 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Such foreign
taxes consist of the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which the Company believes qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. income
taxes.  The foreign tax credit carryovers expire as follows: $785 million in 2022; $976 million in 2023; $782 million in 2024; and $318 million in 2025. The foreign
tax credit carryovers are subject to valuation allowance as described further below.

The Company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $23 million that will not expire.

For  state  income  tax  purposes,  the  Company  has  Illinois  and  New  Jersey  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of  $82  million  and  $207  million,  respectively,
which equates to deferred tax assets after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance, of $4 million and $12 million, respectively.  The Illinois net operating
loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021 through 2026.  The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2029 through
2035.

As  of  December  31,  2015,  the  scheduled  future  reversal  of  existing  U.S.  federal  taxable  temporary  differences  exceeds  the  scheduled  future  reversal  of
existing  U.S.  federal  deductible  temporary  differences.  Consequently,  the  Company  no  longer  applies  a  valuation  allowance  against  its  U.S.  federal  deferred  tax
assets other than the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset and a capital loss carryforward. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion against the
$2.9 billion foreign tax credit deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015.  In addition, there is an $18 million valuation allowance, after federal effect, provided on
certain  state  deferred  tax  assets,  a  valuation  allowance  of  $3  million  on  a  federal  income  tax  capital  loss  carryforward,  a  valuation  allowance  of  $69  million  on
certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $1 million on Hong Kong net operating losses because we believe these assets do not meet the “more
likely than not” criteria for recognition.

The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau.  Because MGM Grand Paradise is
presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a
tax  paid  in  lieu  of  an  income  tax  that  is  creditable  against  U.S.  taxes.  Although  MGM  Grand  Paradise’s  current  five-year  exemption  from  the  Macau  12%
complementary  tax  on  gaming  profits  ends  on  December  31,  2016,  the  Company  assumes  that  it  will  receive  an  additional  five-year  exemption  beyond  2016
consistent with the assumption utilized for measurement of the net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise.  For all periods beyond December 31, 2021, the
Company has assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will be paying the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits and will thus not be able to credit the Macau
Special Gaming Tax in such years, and has factored that assumption into its assessment of the realization of the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset.

Furthermore, the Company does not currently rely on future U.S. source operating income in assessing future foreign tax credit realization due to its recent
history of cumulative losses in the U.S. and therefore only relies on U.S. federal taxable temporary differences that it expects will reverse during the 10-year foreign
tax credit carryover period. However, due to improvements in its U.S. operations the Company has generated U.S. operating profits for the past four consecutive
quarters.  Should these profits continue in future periods, the Company may during the next 12 months begin to utilize projections of future U.S. source operating
income  in  its  assessment  of  the  realizability  of  its  foreign  tax  credit  deferred  tax  asset,  which  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  valuation  allowance  and  a
corresponding reduction in the provision for income taxes in such period.  However, the exact timing and amount of reduction in the valuation allowance are subject
to change on the basis of the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $8 million and $12 million at December 31, 2015

and 2014, respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized  tax benefits in income tax expense.  The Company accrued $4 million in
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014.  There were no amounts accrued for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2015.  No amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date.  Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes interest benefit
related to unrecognized tax benefits as follows: $4 million benefit in 2015, $13 million benefit in 2014 and $12 million benefit in 2013.

The Company files  income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,  various state and local jurisdictions,  and foreign jurisdictions,  although the income
taxes  paid in foreign  jurisdictions  are  not material.   As of December  31, 2015, the Company is no longer  subject to examination  of its U.S. consolidated  federal
income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2010.  During 2015, the Company received final approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the
IRS examination of the 2009 tax year and agreed to all IRS adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate
treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. The Company received a refund of $16 million of taxes and associated interest in connection with the settlement of
these  examinations,  which  are  now  considered  settled  for  financial  accounting  purposes.  During  2014,  the  Company  received  final  approval  from  the  Joint
Committee on Taxation of the results of the IRS examination of its consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through 2009 tax years; the 2007 through
2008 tax years of CityCenter Holdings, LLC; the 2008 through 2009 tax years of MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, a subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax
purposes;  and  the  2005  through  2009  tax  years  of  Marina  District  Development  Holding  Company,  LLC  an  unconsolidated  affiliate  treated  as  a  partnership  for
income tax purposes. These examinations are now considered settled for financial reporting purposes.  The Company previously deposited $30 million with the IRS
to cover the expected cash taxes and interest resulting from the tentatively agreed adjustments for these examinations.

As  of  December  31,  2015,  other  than  adjustments  resulting  from  the  federal  income  tax  audits  discussed  above,  the  Company  was  no  longer  subject  to
examination of its various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2011. During 2015, the state of New Jersey completed its examination of Marina
District Development Holding Company, LLC for the 2003 through 2009 tax years. All adjustments were agreed to by the members of Marina District Development
Holding Company, LLC and the examination  is now considered  settled  for financial  accounting  purposes.  The Company made a $1 million  payment of tax and
associated interest as a result of this settlement.  No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

The Company does not anticipate  that the total  amounts of unrecognized  tax benefits  at December  31, 2015 will change  materially  within the  next twelve

months.

The current and long-term obligations under capital leases are included in “Other accrued liabilities” and “Other long-term obligations,” respectively.  Rental
expense for operating leases was $74 million, $65 million and $41 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amounts included short term rentals charged to
rent expense.  Rental expense includes $7 million related to the Cotai land concession for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company accounts for the Cotai land concession
contract  as  an  operating  lease  for  which  the  required  upfront  payments  are  amortized  over  the  initial  25-year  contract  term.  Rent  recognized  for  the  Cotai  land
concession is included in “Preopening and start-up expenses” prior to opening.

In April 2013, the Company entered into a ground lease agreement for an approximate 23 acre parcel of land in connection with the MGM National Harbor
project. The ground lease has an initial term of 25 years and the right to extend for up to 13 additional six year periods with the first 7 of those additional periods
considered to be reasonably assured. The Company therefore amortizes the lease on a straight line basis over a 67 year term. The ground lease is accounted for as an
operating lease with rental expense of $19 million and $13 million recorded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Rent recognized for the
ground lease is included in "Preopening and start-up expenses" prior to opening .

Cotai
land
concession
contract.
   MGM Grand Paradise’s  land concession contract  for an approximate  18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau became
effective on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. The total land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161
million  and  is  composed  of  a  down  payment  and  eight  additional  semi-annual  payments.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  MGM  China  had  paid  $130  million  of  the
contract premium, including interest due on the semi-annual installments, and the amount paid is recorded within “Other long-term assets, net.” In January 2016,
MGM  China  paid  the  sixth  semi-annual  installment  of  $15  million  under  the  land  concession  contract.    Including  interest  on  the  two  remaining  semi-annual
installments, MGM China has approximately $29 million remaining payable for the land concession contract. Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM
Grand Paradise is required to build and open MGM Cotai by January 2018.

CityCenter
completion
guarantee.
  In October 2013, the Company entered into a third amended and restated completion and cost overrun guarantee, which
was collateralized by substantially all of the assets of Circus Circus Las Vegas, as well as certain land adjacent to that property. During the first quarter of 2015, the
Company  fulfilled  its  remaining  significant  obligations  under  the  completion  guarantee  in  conjunction  with  the  resolution  of  the  Perini  litigation  and  related
settlement agreements. In total, the Company funded $888 million under the completion guarantee. In June 2015, the completion guarantee was terminated and the
collateral assets securing such completion guarantee were released.

T-Mobile
Arena.
In conjunction with the Las Vegas Arena Company entering a senior secured credit facility in 2014, the Company and AEG each entered
joint and several completion guarantees for the project, as well as a repayment guarantee for term loan B (which is subject to increases and decreases in the event of
a rebalancing of the principal amount of indebtedness between the term loan A and term loan B facilities). As of December 31, 2015, term loan A was $120 million
and term loan B was $80 million.

Other
guarantees.
  The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit
issued  by  financial  institutions.  The  Company’s  senior  credit  facility  limits  the  amount  of  letters  of  credit  that  can  be  issued  to  $500  million,  and  the  amount  of
available borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $26 million in letters of
credit outstanding.   MGM China’s

93

senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $100 million, and the amount of available borrowings under the senior credit facility i
s reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.   At December 31, 2015 MGM China had provided approximately $39 million of guarantees under its credit facility.

Other
litigation.
  The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business.  Management does

not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

2005
Omnibus
Incentive
Plan.

 The  Company’s  omnibus  incentive  plan,  as  amended  (the  “Omnibus  Plan”),  allows  it  to  grant  stock  options,  stock
appreciation  rights  (“SARs”),  restricted  stock  units  (“RSUs”),  performance  share  units  (“PSUs”)  and  other  stock-based  awards  to  eligible  directors,  officers  and
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Omnibus Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors.
The  Committee  has  discretion  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  regarding  which  type  of  awards  to  grant,  the  vesting  and  service  requirements,  exercise  price  and  other
conditions, in all cases subject to certain limits, including:

·

·

As amended, the Omnibus Plan allows for the issuance of up to 45 million shares or share-based awards; and
For stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the
maximum term of such an award is 10 years.

SARs  granted  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  generally  have  terms  of  seven  years,  and  in  most  cases  vest  in  four  equal  annual  installments.  RSUs  granted  vest
ratably over four years, a portion of which are subject to achievement of a performance target based on operational results compared to budget in order for such
RSUs to be eligible to vest. Expense is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated
forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

PSUs granted vest subject to a market condition, in which a percentage of the target award granted vests based on the performance of the Company’s stock
price in relation to the target price at the end of a three year performance period.  Specifically, the ending average stock price must equal the target price, which is
defined as 125% of the beginning average stock price, in order for the target award to vest.  No shares are issued unless the ending average stock price is at least 60%
of the target price, and the maximum payout is capped at 160% of the target award.  If the ending average stock price is at least 60% or more of the target price, then
the amount of units granted in the target award is multiplied by the stock performance multiplier.  The stock performance multiplier equals the ending average stock
price divided by the target price.  For this purpose, the target and ending prices are based on the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 60
calendar  day periods ending on the  grant date and the third anniversary  of the grant date.   Expense is recognized  on a graded basis over the performance  period
beginning on the date of grant. Estimated forfeitures are updated periodically with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had an aggregate of approximately 22 million shares of common stock available for grant as share-based awards

under the Omnibus Plan.  A summary of activi ty under the Company’s share-based payment plans for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below:

average  period  of  1.8  years.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  there  was  a  total  of  $21  million  of  unamortized  compensation  related  to  PSUs  which  is  expected  to  be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

The Company grants PSUs for a portion of any calculated bonus for a Section 16 officer of the Company that is in excess of such officer’s base salary (the
“Bonus PSU Policy”). Awards granted under the Bonus PSU Policy have the same terms as the other PSUs granted under the Omnibus Plan with the exception that
as of the grant date the awards will not be subject to forfeiture in the event of the officer’s termination. In March 2015 and 2014, the Company granted 0.2 million
and 0.3 million PSUs pursuant to the Bonus PSU Policy with a target price of $25.91 and $31.72, respectively. Additionally, the Company grants PSUs for certain
employees of the Company in connection with the Profit Growth Plan (“Profit Growth Plan PSUs”). Profit Growth Plan PSUs have the same terms as the other PSUs
granted under the Omnibus Plan with the exception of an additional service and performance condition tied to the results of the Profit Growth Plan which must be
achieved for the awards to vest. In October 2015, the Company granted 0.3 million Profit Growth Plan PSUs with a target price of $25.76. Awards granted under the
Bonus PSU Policy and in connection with the Profit Growth Plan are excluded from the table above.

MGM
China
Share
Option
Plan.
  The Company’s subsidiary, MGM China, adopted an equity award plan in 2011 for grants of stock options to purchase
ordinary shares of MGM China to eligible directors, employees and non-employees of MGM China and its subsidiaries (“MGM China Plan”).  The MGM China
Plan is administered by MGM China’s Board of Directors, which has the discretion to determine the exercise price and term of the award, as well as other conditions,
in all cases subject to certain limits, including:

·

·

The  maximum  number  of  shares  which  may  be  issued  upon exercise  of  all  options  to  be  granted  under  the  MGM China  Plan  shall  not  in  aggregate
exceed 10% of the total number of shares in issue as of the date of the shareholders’ approval of the MGM China Plan; and
The exercise price of the award must be the higher of the closing price of the stock on the offer date, or the average of the closing price for the five
business days immediately preceding the offer date, and the maximum term of the award must not exceed ten years.

Stock options currently granted under the MGM China Plan have a term of ten years, and vest in four equal annual installments.  Expense is recognized on a
straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards  net  of  estimated  forfeitures.    Forfeitures  are  estimated  at  the  time  of  grant,  with  such  estimate  updated
periodically and with actual forfeitures recognized currently to the extent they differ from the estimate.

As  of  December  31,  2015,  MGM  China  had  an  aggregate  of  approximately  327  million  shares  of  options  available  for  grant  as  share-based  awards.  A

summary of activity under the MGM China Plan for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below:

Expected volatility is based in part on historical volatility and in part on implied volatility based on traded options on the Company’s stock.  The expected
term considers the contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise and forfeiture behavior.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates in effect on the
grant date for U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term of the award.

Compensation  cost  for  PSUs  granted  under  the  Omnibus  Plan  is  based  on  the  fair  value  of  each  award,  measured  by  applying  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation

Expected volatilities are based on a blend of historical volatility from a selection of companies in MGM China’s peer group and historical volatility of MGM
China’s stock price.  Expected term considers the contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise behavior of previously granted options.  Dividend yield
is based on the estimate of annual dividends expected to be paid at the time of the grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on rates in effect at the valuation date for
the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Notes with maturities matching the relevant expected term of the award.

NOTE

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT
PLANS

Multiemployer
benefit
plans.
  Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,
multiemployer health and welfare and defined benefit pension plans.  Of these plans, the Company considers the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension
Plan (the “Pension Plan”), under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas for and on behalf of Culinary
Workers Union Local No. 226 and Bartenders Union Local No. 165, to be individually significant. The risk of participating in the Pension Plan differs from single-
employer plans in the following aspects:

a)
b)
c)

d)

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;
If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers;
If an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the
underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability;
If the Pension Plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal
liability payments, employers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference.

Pursuant  to  its  collective  bargaining  agreements  referenced  above,  the  Company  also  contributes  to  UNITE  HERE  Health  (the  “Health  Fund”),  which

provides healthcare benefits to its active and retired members. The Company’s participation in the Pension Plan is outlined in the table below.

The trustees of the Pension Plan have elected to apply the extended amortization  and the special ten year asset smoothing rules under the Pension
Relief Act of 2010.
The Company is party to ten collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to the Pension Plan.  The agreements between CityCenter
Hotel Casino, LLC, Bellagio, Mandalay Corp., MGM Grand Hotel, LLC and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas are the most significant
because more than half of the Company’s employee participants in the Pension Plan are covered by those four agreements.

During 2014 an  amendment  to  the  collective  bargaining  agreements  to  temporarily  divert  contributions  from  the  Pension  Plan  to  the  Health  Fund  was  in
effect. As a result contributions to the Pension Plan decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased in 2015 compared to 2014 as the amendment ended in June of
2014. Hours worked in 2015 increased approximately 1% compared to 2014. Bellagio, Aria, Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas were listed in the Pension
Plan’ s Forms 5500 as providing more than 5% of the total contributions for the plan years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. At the date the financial statements
were issued, Form 5500 was not available for the plan year ending in 2015. No surcharges were impose d on the Company’s contributions to any of the plans.

Self-insurance.
  The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability for health
care  claims  filed  and  estimates  of  claims  incurred  but  not  reported  was  $22  million  and  $20  million  at  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  respectively.  The  workers
compensation  liability  for  claims  filed  and  estimates  of  claims  incurred  but  not  reported  was  $43  million  and  $48  million  as  of  December  31,  2015  and  2014,
respectively. Both liabilities are included in “Other accrued liabilities.”

Retirement
savings
plans.
  The Company has retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the IRC for eligible employees.  The plans allow employees
to defer, within prescribed limits, up to 75% of their income on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis through contributions to the plans. The Company matches 50% of the
first 6% of eligible employee deferrals up to a specified annual maximum dollar amount. The Company recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of $16 million,
$17 million and $13 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion
of their salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the deferred balances, as a deferred tax savings. All employee deferrals
vest immediately. The Company does not contribute to the plan.

The  Company  also  maintains  nonqualified  supplemental  executive  retirement  plans  (“SERP”)  for  certain  key  employees.  Until  September  2008,  the
Company made quarterly contributions intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year average annual
salary, up to a maximum of 65%. The Company has indefinitely suspended these contributions. Employees do not make contributions under these plans. A portion of
the  Company  contributions  and  investment  earnings  thereon  vest  after  three  years  of  SERP participation  and  the  remaining  portion  vests  after  both  five  years  of
SERP participation and 10 years of continuous service.

MGM
China.
MGM China contributes to a retirement plan as part of an employee benefits package for eligible employees.  The Company recorded charges

related to contributions in the retirement plan of $7 million, $5 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment.  Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic
characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting
structure.   The Company’s principal  operating  activities  occur  in two geographic  regions: the United States and Macau S.A.R.  The Company has aggregated  its
operations  into  two  reportable  segments  based  on  the  similar  characteristics  of  the  operating  segments  within  the  regions  in  which  they  operate:  wholly  owned
domestic resorts and MGM China. The Company’s operations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, MGM Hospitality, and certain other corporate and
management  operations have not been identified  as separate  reportable  segments; therefore,  these operations  are included in corporate  and other in the following
segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

The Company’s management utilizes Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments. Adjusted Property EBITDA is a
measure  defined  as  Adjusted  EBITDA  before  corporate  expense  and  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  the  Omnibus  Plan,  which  are  not  allocated  to  the
reportable  segments  or  each  operating  segment,  as  applicable.  MGM  China  recognizes  stock  compensation  expense  related  to  the  MGM  China  Plan  which  is
included  in  the  calculation  of  Adjusted  EBITDA  for  MGM  China.  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  a  measure  defined  as  earnings  before  interest  and  other  non-operating
income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net.

during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total loss per share amounts for the year. T he following sections list
certain items affecting comparability of quarterly and year-to-date results and related per share amounts. Additional information related to these items is included
elsewhere in the notes to the accompanying financial statements.

2015 certain items affecting comparability are as follows:

·

·

First
Quarter.
The Company recorded an $80 million ($0.09 and $0.10 per share in the quarter and full year of 2015, respectively) gain for its share of

Capital Contribution”), except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the amounts to be contributed shall be payable by the Members in proportion to
their respective Profit Interests or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement; provided, however , that prior to the Effective Date but after March 26, 2009,

drawn. Draws on the Letters of Credit were made in the following order:

(i) the first $135 million from the DW L/C;

(ii) the next $224 million from the MGM L/C; and

Section 3.5 Failure to Make a Capital Contribution . If a Member fails to make any required Capital Contribution as set forth herein from and after the
Effective Date (the “Delinquent Member”), then such Delinquent Member shall be subject to th e provisions of Article 13. In addition, the Member that did not fail
to  make  any  required  Capital  Contribution  as  set  forth  herein  (the  “Non-Delinquent  Member”)  may  exercise,  on  notice  to  the  Delinquent  Member,  one  of  the
following remedies:

default, with the following results:

(a) the Non-Delinquent Member (the “Lending Member”) may advance the portion of the Delinquent Member’s Capital Contribution that is in

(i) The sum advanced shall constitute  a loan from the Lending Member to the Delinquent Member (each, a “Member  Loan”) and a
Capital Contribution of that sum to the Company by the Delinquent Member and shall be treated as such by the Parties for U.S. federal, state and local income tax
purposes;

written demand by the Lending Member to the Delinquent Member;

(ii) The unpaid principal balance of the Member Loan and all accrued unpaid interest shall be due and payable on the tenth day after

the advance is deemed made until the date that the Member Loan, together with all accrued interest, is repaid to the Lending Member;

(iii) The unpaid balance of the Member Loan shall bear interest at the Default Interest Rate, compounded monthly, from the day that

(iv) All amounts distributable by the Company to the Delinquent Member shall (A) be paid to the Lending Member until the Member
Loan  and  all  accrued  interest  have  been  paid  in  full;  (B)  constitute  a  distribution  to  the  Delinquent  Member  followed  by  a  repayment  of  the  Member  Loan  and
accrued interest from the Delinquent Member to the Lending Member; and (C) be treated as such by the Parties for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes;

(v) In addition to the other rights and remedies granted to it under this Agreement, the Lending Member has the right to take any action
available  at  law  or  in  equity,  at  the  cost  and  expense  of  the  Delinquent  Member,  to  obtain  payment  from  the  Delinquent  Member  of  the  unpaid  balance  of  the
Member Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest; and

(vi) The Delinquent Member grants to the Company, and to each Lending Member with respect to any Member Loans made to that
Delinquent Member, as security, equally and ratably for the payment of all Capital Contributions that the Delinquent Member has agreed to make and the payment of
all Member Loans and interest accrued made by Lending Members to that Delinquent Member, a security interest in its assets under the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State of Nevada. On any default in the payment of a required Capital Contribution or in the payment of a Member Loan to a Lending Member or interest
accrued, the Company or the Lending Member, as applicable, is entitled to all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the
State of Nevada with respect to the security interest granted. Each Delinquent Member hereby authorizes the Company and each Lending Member, as applicable, to
prepare and file financing statements and other instruments that the Managing Member or the Lending Member, as applicable, may deem necessary to effectuate and
carry out the preceding provisions of this Section 3.5(a).

(b)  the  Non-Delinquent  Member  may  contribute  the  portion  of  the  Delinquent  Member’s  Capital  Contribution  that  is  in  default,  with  the
following results: Immediately following the contribution by the Non-Delinquent Member of a portion or all of the Delinquent Member’s Capital Contribution, the
Profit  Interest  of  the  Non-Delinquent  Member  in  the  Company  shall  be  increased  and  the  Profit  Interest  of  the  Delinquent  Member  in  the  Company  shall  be
decreased, with the result that such change in Profit Interest shall be permanent, and the Delinquent Member shall not have the option, other than pursuant to this
Section  3.5(b),  to  restore  its  initial  Profit  Interest  by  making  a  curative  Capital  Contribution  at  a  later  time.  The  resulting  Profit  Interest  of  the  Non-Delinquent
Member shall be the number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a percentage point) determined in accordance with the following formula:
(A) determine the Profit Interest of the Non-Delinquent Member immediately prior to the corresponding Additional Capital Contribution and (B) add the Individual
Base Profit Interest Addition corresponding to such Member with respect to such Additional Capital Contribution and (C) add the Individual Adjusted Profit Interest
Addition corresponding to such Member with respect to such Additional Capital Contribution. The resulting Profit Interest of the Delinquent Member shall be the
number of percentage points (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a percentage point) determined in accordance with the following formula: (A) determine the
Profit Interest of such Delinquent Member immediately prior to the corresponding Additional Capital Contribution, (B) subtract the Individual Base Profit Interest
Subtraction corresponding to such Member with respect to such Additional Capital Contribution and (C) subtract the Individual Adjusted Profit Interest Subtraction
corresponding to such Member with respect to such Additional Capital Contribution. The “Profit Interest” of each of MGM and IW as of the Effective Date is 50%.
The Company shall not issue Units to any Member solely to reflect any increase in any Member’s Profit Interest, and a Member’s Interest shall not be deemed to
increase or decrease solely as a result of an increase or decrease in the Member’s Profit Interest.

13 -

For the purposes of this Section 3.5(b), (1) “Base Profit Interest” shall mean, with respect to a Member, the percentage equivalent of a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the aggregate Capital Contributions made to the Company by such Member pursuant to this Agreement, and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate Capital Contributions made to the Company by all the Members pursuant to this Agreement, (2) “Individual Adjusted Profit Interest Addition” shall mean
the  product  of  (i)  0.5  and  (ii)  the  difference  between  (A)  the  Base  Profit  Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  after  the  corresponding  Additional  Capital
Contribution  and  (B)  the  Base  Profit  Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  prior  to  such  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  (3)  “Individual  Base  Profit  Interest
Addition” shall mean the difference between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately after such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) the Base
Profit  Interest  of  such  Member  immediately  prior  to  such  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  (4)  “Individual  Adjusted  Profit  Interest  Subtraction”  shall  mean  the
product of (i) 0.5 and (ii) the difference between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately prior to such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) the
Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately after such Additional Capital Contribution, and (5) “Individual Base Profit Interest Subtraction” shall mean the
difference between (A) the Base Profit Interest of such Member immediately prior to such Additional Capital Contribution and (B) the Base Profit Interest of such
Member immediately after such Additional Capital Contribution.

By way of illustration, assume that (A) the Base Profit Interest and the Profit Interest of each Member is fifty percent (50%), in each case, immediately prior
to a Additional  Capital Contribution;  (B) each of the Parties  have  made a prior Capital Contribution  of $3,000,000,000; (C) the Members approve  an Additional
Capital  Contribution  pursuant  to  Section  3.3  hereof  in  the  amount  of  $500,000,000,  and  (D)  IW  contributes  only  $150,000,000  (versus  $250,000,000).  If  MGM
contributes the $100,000,000 shortfall by IW in addition to its own $250,000,000 pro
rata
share of the Capital Contribution, the resulting Profit Interest of MGM
following such contribution would be 52.31%, determined as follows:

Base Profit Interest of MGM after the Additional Capital Contribution:

[$3,000,000,000 plus $350,000,000] divided by [$6,500,000,000] = 51.54%

Base Profit Interest of MGM prior to the Additional Capital Contribution: 50%

Individual Adjusted Profit Interest Addition of MGM as a result of the Additional Capital Contribution:

(51.54%-50%) x 0.5 = 0.77%

Individual Base Profit Interest Addition of MGM as a result of the Additional Capital Contribution:

(51.54%-50%) = 1.54%

Profit Interest of MGM after the Additional Capital Contribution:

50% + 1.54% + 0.77% = 52.31%.

Accordingly, the resulting Profit Interest of MGM would be 52.31%.

Assume  that,  following  such  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  each  of  the  Members  approve  a  second  Additional  Capital  Contribution  pursuant  to
Section 3.3 in the amount of $100,000,000, and IW fails to contribute any of such second Additional Capital Contribution. If MGM contributes the
$50,000,000  shortfall  by  IW  in  addition  to  its  own  $50,000,000  pro
rata
 share  of  the  second  Additional  Capital  Contribution,  the  resulting  Profit
Interest of MGM following such contribution would be 53.41%, determined as follows:

Base  Profit  Interest  of  MGM  after  the  second  Additional  Capital  Contribution:  [$3,000,000,000  plus $350,000,000 plus $100,000,000] divided by
[$6,600,000,000] = 52.27%

Base  Profit  Interest  of  MGM  immediately  prior  to  the  second  Additional  Capital  Contribution:  [$3,000,000,000  plus  $350,000,000]  divided  by
[$6,500,000,000] = 51.54%

Individual Adjusted Profit Interest Addition of MGM as a result of the second Additional Capital Contribution:

(52.27%-51.54%) x 0.5 = 0.37%

-
14 -

Individual Base Profit Interest Addition of MGM as a result of the second Additional Capital Contribution:

(52.27%-51.54%) = 0.73%

Profit Interest of MGM immediately prior to the second Additional Capital Contribution:

52.31%.

Profit Interest of MGM after the second Additional Capital Contribution: 52.31% + 0.73% + 0.37% = 53.41%.

Section 3.6 Additional Remedies for Failure to Make an Additional Capital Contribution . In addition to the remedies provided under Section 3.5, the
Company  may,  on  notice  to  a  Delinquent  Member,  take  such  action,  at  the  cost  and  expense  of  the  Delinquent  Member,  to  obtain  payment  by  the  Delinquent
Member of the portion of the Delinquent Member’s Additional Capital Contribution that is in default, together with interest on that amount at the Default Interest
Rate from the date that the Additional Capital Contribution was due until the date that it is made, provided , however , that in the event that a Member fails to make
its  Additional  Capital  Contribution  within  ten  (10)  Business  Days  following  the  receipt  of  written  notice  from  the  other  Member  that  the  Additional  Capital
Contribution  is  due,  then  such  Delinquent  Member  shall  also  be  required  to  pay  the  other  Member  an  “inconvenience  fee”  equal  to  ten  percent  (10%)  of  any
Additional Capital Contribution shortfall. The Delinquent Member’s obligation to make Additional Capital Contributions or repay any Member Loan to a Lending
Member shall be recourse to such Delinquent Member (except to the extent and after such time that the Non-Delinquent Member elects to make a contribution of any
portion of the Delinquent Member’s Additional Capital Contribution). The Delinquent Member shall have direct liability for the Delinquent Member’s obligation to
make Capital Contributions or repay any loan to a Lending Member. Payment of interest and the inconvenience fee shall not be treated as Capital Contributions and
shall not increase the Capital Account of the paying Member.

Section 3.7 Capital Accounts .

(a)  There  shall  be  maintained  for  each  Member  a  separate  capital  account  (“Capital  Account”)  which  shall  be  governed  and  maintained
throughout  the  existence  of  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Regulations  Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the
foregoing, a Member’s Capital Account shall be increased by (A) the amount of money contributed by such Member to the Company, (B) the Gross Asset Value of
any property contributed by such Member to the Company (net of liabilities securing such contributed property that the Company is considered to assume or take
subject to pursuant to Code Section 752), (C) the amount of any Profits allocated to such Member and any items in the nature of income or gain which are specially
allocated to such Member hereunder, and (D) the amount of any Company liabilities assumed by such Member or which are secured by any property distributed to

by the Company (net of liabilities securing such distributed property that such Member is considered to assume or take subject to under Code Section 752), (Y) the
amount of any Losses allocated to such Member and any items in the nature of expenses or losses which are specially allocated to such Member hereunder, and (Z)
the amount of any liabilities of such Member assumed by the Company or which are secured by any property contributed by such Member to the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 3.7(a) above, the principal amount of a promissory note which is not readily traded on an established securities
market and which is contributed to the Company by the maker of the note (or a Person related to the maker of the note within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( c
))  shall  not  be  included  in  the  Capital  Account  of  any  Person  until  the  Company  makes  a  taxable  disposition  of  the  note  or  until  (and  to  the
extent) principal payments are made on the note, all in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( d

comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. In the event that at any time during
the existence of the Company the Tax Matters Partner, with the advice of legal counsel or accountants, shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner in
which  the  Capital  Accounts,  or  any  debits  or  credits  thereto,  are  computed  in  order  to  comply  with  such  Regulations,  the  Tax  Matters  Partner  may  make  such
modification.

Section 3.8 Return of Capital . Except as specifically provided herein, no Member may withdraw capital from the Company. To the extent any cash
that  any  Member  is  entitled  to  receive  pursuant  to  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  would  constitute  a  return  of  capital,  each  of  the  Members  consents  to  the
withdrawal of such capital. If any capital is, or is to be, returned to a Member, the Member shall not have the right to receive property other than cash, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. No interest shall be payable on the Capital Contributions made by the Members to the Company. The Members
hereby agree that any payment received by MGM or its Affiliate pursuant to an Additional Agreement shall not be deemed a withdrawal of capital by, or a return of
capital to, MGM or its Affiliates.

Section 3.9 Gross Asset Value .

(a) “ Gross Asset Value ” means, with respect to any asset, the asset’s adjusted basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as follows:

the Members by unanimous approval;

(ii) The Gross Asset Value of all Company assets shall be adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values, as Approved by
the  Board  of  Directors,  as  of  the  following  times:  (i)  the  acquisition  of  additional  Profit  Interests  or  Units  in  the  Company  by  any  new  or  existing  Member  in
exchange for more than a de
minimis
Capital Contribution; (ii) the distribution by the Company to a Member of more than a de
minimis

Section 4.1 Intentionally Omitted .

Section 4.2 Licensing .

(a) Cooperation .  Each  Member  shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  prepare,  file  and  process  applications  to  obtain  all  necessary
Gaming registrations, licenses, findings of suitability and approvals from Gaming Authorities that are required for the Company and its Subsidiaries to operate the
Project. Further, each Member shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the members of such Members to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare, file and process applications to obtain all necessary Gaming registrations, licenses, findings of suitability and approvals from Gaming Authorities that are
required  in  connection  with  the  ownership  of  an  interest  in  the  Company  and  to  obtain  as  soon  as  practicable  all  consents  necessary  to  permit  the  Company  to
consummate  its  purposes  as  set  forth  in  Section  1.4  hereof  without  breaching  or  violating  any  applicable  Gaming  Law.  Each  Member  shall,  and  shall  cause  its
Affiliates to, (i) reasonably cooperate with any investigation by any Gaming Authority having jurisdiction over any Member or any Affiliate of any Member, and use
its best efforts to promptly comply with any directives of any such Gaming Authority, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Transferee of any
portion of its Units likewise to so cooperate and comply. Each Member agrees that it shall not intentionally take any action or omit to take any action that would
have  the  effect  of  adversely  affecting  any  Gaming  registration,  license,  approval,  finding  of  suitability  or  permit  held  by  any  Member  or  Affiliate  thereof.  The
Members  and  their  Affiliates  shall  fully  cooperate  in  connection  with  any  review  of  this  Agreement  by  any  Gaming  Authority.  Each  Member  shall  cooperate
reasonably and shall (i) furnish upon request to each other such further information, (ii) execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (iii) do such
other  acts  and  things,  as  may  be  reasonably  requested  by  the  other  Member  or  the  Managing  Member  in  obtaining  the  licenses  and  consents  referred  to  in  this
Section 4.2. Each Member acknowledges that monetary damages alone would not be adequate compensation for a breach of this Section 4.2 and the Members agree
that  a  non-breaching  Member  shall  be  entitled  to  seek  a  decree  or  order  from  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  for  specific  performance  to  restrain  a  breach  or
threatened breach of this Section 4.2 or to require compliance by a Member with this Section 4.2.

In the event that either Member shall intentionally obstruct the process for the Gaming Approvals in a manner that results in an unreasonable delay in

receiving such Gaming Approvals, then:

(i)  If  IW  shall  be  the  party  so  obstructing  and  continuing  to  obstruct  ten  (10)  Business  Days  after  IW’s  receipt  of  written  notice
specifying such obstruction from MGM, then, at the election of MGM, either (A) MGM may elect to purchase all rights and title to all of the Units owned directly or
indirectly by IW and its Affiliates at the lesser of (1) the Conditional Transfer Price and (2) the amount of the Unreturned Investment for IW, and IW will Transfer
and  sell  such  Units  to  MGM, or  (B)  MGM may  obtain  an  injunction  to  exercise  specific  performance  rights  requiring  IW’s  cooperation  with  the  process  for  the
Gaming Approvals.

(ii) If MGM shall be the party so obstructing and continuing to obstruct ten (10) Business Days after MGM’s receipt of written notice
specifying such obstruction from IW, then, at the election of IW, either (A) MGM shall purchase all rights and title to all of the Units owned directly or indirectly by
IW and its Affiliates at the greater of (1) the Conditional Transfer Price and (2) the amount of the Unreturned Investment for IW, and IW will Transfer and sell such
Units  to  MGM,  or  (B)  IW  may  obtain  an  injunction  to  exercise  specific  performance  rights  requiring  MGM’s  cooperation  with  the  process  for  the  Gaming
Approvals.

In the event that either Member elects to have MGM purchase all rights and title to all of the Units of IW, then the payment of the applicable purchase price shall be
in cash by wire transfer of federal funds and the Transfer of Units shall take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days following the date such Member
makes an election to have MGM purchase the Units (the “Cash Purchase Procedure”).

(b) Delayed Gaming Approval . The Members agree that, in the event that the Managing Member, based on its reasonable judgment, including
its consultation with Approved Counsel, believes that the IW Gaming Approvals will likely not be granted or issued until some time after the anticipated Casino
Opening  Date,  the  Company  and  the  Managing  Member  or  its  Affiliate  will  enter  into  one  or  more  lease  agreements  (the  “Lease  Agreements”)  prior  to  the
anticipated Casino Opening Date, which Lease Agreements, while in effect, would replace the corresponding provisions in the Operations Management Agreements
for all Gaming Components, and pursuant to which MGM or its Affiliate will lease all such Gaming Components from the Company and operate and manage such
Gaming Components. The terms of such Lease Agreement shall be Approved by the Board of Directors and shall provide for such payment terms to the Company to
reflect  substantially  the  identical  economic  benefits  that  the  Company  would  have  realized  from  such  Gaming  Components  had  the  Operations  Management
Agreements been in effect. The Lease Agreements shall terminate five (5) Business Days after the IW Gaming Approvals have been duly issued. For the purposes of
this  Section  4.2,  "IW  Gaming  Approvals"  shall  mean  all  Gaming  Approvals  necessary  for  IW  to  obtain  in  order  for  the  Company  to  own  or  operate,  directly  or
through a Subsidiary, any Gaming Component, for IW to hold any ownership or other interest in the Company, or for MGM or its Affiliates to be associated with IW
or its Affiliates in connection with the Project or the Company.

(c) Rejection of Gaming Approval .

(i) At any time prior to the date on which IW receives the IW Gaming Approvals, in the event that MGM or its Affiliates are prohibited

Approvals shall be deemed to have been rejected, and “Casino Opening Date” shall mean the date on which the Cesar Pelli-designed resort casino opens for business
to the public.

Approved Counsel or from the applicable Gaming Authorities that the Gaming Components may continue to be operated pursuant to the Lease Agreements (or any
other  arrangements  to  permit  the  operating  of  the  Gaming  Components)  and  (B)  MGM  or  its  Affiliates  are  not  prohibited  from  being  associated  with  IW  or  its
Affiliates  in  connection  with  the  Project  or  the  Company,  then  IW  and  MGM  shall  remain  Members  of  the  Company  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  so  long  as  the
previous clauses (A) and (B) continue to be true.

(2) If, due to IW’s continuing  ownership of the Company, (A) the Company obtains  an opinion or guidance  from Approved
Counsel or from the applicable Gaming Authorities that the Gaming Components may not continue to be operated pursuant to the Lease Agreements (or any other
arrangements to permit the operating of the Gaming Components) and (B) MGM or its Affiliates are prohibited from being associated with IW or its Affiliates in
connection  with  the  Project  or  the  Company,  then  MGM  may  elect  to  purchase  all  rights  and  title  to  all  of  the  Units  owned  directly  or  indirectly  by  IW  and  its
Affiliates at the amount of the Unreturned Investment for IW, and IW will transfer and sell such Units to MGM. Such purchase shall be consummated in accordance

(d) Remedies  Not  Exclusive  .  Availability  of  any  other  remedy  to  the  Members  under  this  Agreement,  including,  but  not  limited  to  such

Section 4.3 Ancillary Agreements .

(a) The Company and MGM or an Affiliate of MGM have negotiated the terms and conditions of the current Ancillary Agreements and shall
negotiate the terms and conditions of any Ancillary Agreements entered into at a future date in good faith. The cost to the Company under an Ancillary Agreement
identified in Exhibit B attached hereto shall be provided for in the Construction Budget or an Annual Budget. In the event that the capital expenditures or operating
costs related to one or more Ancillary Agreements described in Exhibit B attached hereto are in excess of the amount set forth in the Construction Budget or Annual
Budget, in each case, as Approved by the Board of Directors, MGM or MGM Parent solely shall be responsible for payment of all such excess costs related to the
Ancillary Agreements, which excess payments shall not constitute Capital Contributions to the Company, but rather are treated as paid outside the Company in its
individual capacity and not as (or on behalf) of a Member.

(b)  In  the  event  any  Ancillary  Agreement  is  not  described  on  Exhibit  B  attached  hereto,  the  improvements  and/or  services  and  benefits
required  for  the  Company  to  have  the  benefits  thereunder  shall  be  provided  by  MGM  or  MGM  Parent  to  the  Company,  and  MGM’s  only  fee  shall  be  a

Section 4.7 Income Tax on Residential Units .

(a) With respect to the first “True Proceeds”, as defined below, received by the Company from closings of the sales or contracts of sale of any
residential  units  in  the  Project  Components,  IW’s  maximum  income  tax  liability,  as  determined  by  IW,  for  federal,  state,  and  foreign  income  tax  purposes
(collectively  the “IW Tax Liability”)  with respect  to any gain allocated  by the Company to IW with respect  to sales of residential  units, in each case,  within the
Project Components shall be limited to $10 million. MGM shall make a Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the IW Tax
Liability over $10 million (the “MGM Additional Contribution”). The Company will distribute the MGM Additional Contribution to IW immediately  upon IW’s
request.  The  amount  of any  MGM Additional  Contribution  shall  be determined  by MGM, subject  to  review  by IW,  on a  quarterly  basis  with such  amount  to  be
funded in cash by MGM no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. “True Proceeds” shall mean the amount equal to $2.673 billion less Actual Pre-
Closing Residential Proceeds.

residential units in the Project Components, each of the Members shall be responsible for its respective tax liability.

(b) With respect to Net Residential Proceeds received by the Company in excess of the first True Proceeds from closings of the sales of any

(c) The Capital Accounts of the Members with respect to the MGM Additional Contribution shall be adjusted such that each of MGM and
IW’s percentage of total capital of the Company immediately before the MGM Additional Contribution equals each such Member’s percentage of total capital of the
Company  immediately  after  the  MGM  Additional  Contribution  and  the  distribution  of  such  amount  by  the  Company  to  IW  (assuming  for  this  purpose  that  such
amount is immediately distributed by the Company to IW). For example, if immediately before a MGM Additional Contribution the total capital of the Company
was $5.4 billion and MGM and IW each shared in 50% of such total capital or $2.7 billion each, upon a $0.1 billion MGM Additional Contribution to the Company,
IW’s and MGM’s Capital Account balance immediately after the MGM Additional Contribution would be $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Subsequently,
the distribution of the MGM Additional Contribution in the amount of $0.1 billion to IW will reduce IW’s Capital Account balance to $2.6 billion, and therefore
allow IW’s and MGM’s Capital Account balance to be in the proper ratio of 50% each. In no event will this adjustment affect IW’s or MGM’s respective Profit
Interest.

as possible with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Company income, gain, loss, or deduction pursuant to this Section 5.5 so

), or is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Regulations Sections 1.704-
2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5); and

-
20 -

(ii) Debit to such Capital Account the items described in clauses (4), (5) and (6) of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( d
) of the Regulations.

The  foregoing  definition  of  Adjusted  Capital  Account  Balance  is  intended  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(  d

preceding sentence, then such Losses shall be allocated to the other Members (to the extent the other Members are not limited in respect of the allocation of Losses

Losses  shall  be  allocated  among  the  Members  in  accordance  with  their  Profit  Interests  as  determined  under  Regulations  Section  1.704-1(b)(3).  Any  Losses
reallocated under this Section shall be taken into account in computing subsequent allocations of income and losses pursuant to this Article 5, so that the net amount
of any item so allocated and the income and losses allocated to each Member pursuant to this Article 5, to the extent possible, shall be equal to the net amount that
would have been allocated to each such Member pursuant to this Article 5 as if no reallocation of Losses had occurred under this Section 5.6(b).

Section  5.7  Section  704(c)  Tax  Allocations  .  In  accordance  with  Code  Section  704(c)  and  the  Regulations  thereunder,  income,  gain,  loss,  and

accordance with the definition of Gross Asset Value) using the “traditional method” pursuant to the Regulations Section 1.704-3(b). If the Gross Asset Value of any
Company asset is adjusted pursuant to Section 3.9(b) hereof, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such asset will take account
of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as under Code Section
704(c)  and  the  Regulations  thereunder  using  the  “traditional  method”  pursuant  to  the  Regulations  Section  1.704-3(b).  The  Tax  Matters  Partner  will  make  any
elections or other decisions relating to such allocations in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to

provisions of this Agreement, Profits and Losses with respect to such Units so Transferred shall be allocated between the transferor and Transferee of such Units on
the  basis  of  the  computation  method  which  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Company,  provided  such  method  is  in  conformity  with  the  methods  prescribed  by  Code
Section 706 and Regulations Section 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii).

Section 5.9 Regulations Interpretation . For purposes of this Agreement, the Regulations Sections referred to herein shall be read and interpreted by

substituting the term “Company” for the term “Partnership,” and by substituting the term “Member” for the term “Partner”.

Section 6.4 hereof during such Fiscal Year were a tax distribution in respect of such Fiscal Year. Any distribution pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to
have  been  made  in  anticipation  of,  and  shall  reduce  in  a  like  amount,  the  respective  distributions  of  the  Members  otherwise  to  be  made  pursuant  to  Section  6.4
hereof.

Person, subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in Section 11.3 hereof and to compliance with the terms of the right of first offer set forth in Section 11.6
hereof and the Tag-Along Rights set forth in Section 11.8 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 11.3 hereof, a Member may at any time Transfer

(a) The transferor and Transferee execute and deliver to the Company such documents and instruments of conveyance as may be necessary or
appropriate in the opinion of counsel to the Company to effect such Transfer and the Transferee executes and delivers to the Company a joinder to this Agreement in

(iv) In the case of a Transfer to a Material Competitor, the non- Transferring Member must consent to such Transfer.

(v) All approvals of any Gaming Authority required to effect a Transfer must be obtained prior to such Transfer.

Section 11.4 Prohibited Transfers .

(a) Any purported Transfer of Units that is not made in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 11.1, Section 11.2, and Section
11.6 hereof shall be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever. In the case of a Transfer or attempted Transfer of Units other than pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Section 11.1, Section 11.2, and Section 11.6 hereof, the Party engaging or attempting to engage in such Transfer is obligated to indemnify, defend and

immediately from the Board of Director and with no further action, (y) act as or appoint a Managing Member, or (z) have a Representative appointed by such Passive
Member  not  vote  on  any  matters  other  than  those  specifically  provided  in  the  Sections  9.3(a)(v),  9.3(a)(vii),  9.3(a)(xii),  9.3(a)(xx),  9.3(a)(xxi),  and  9.3(a)(xxii)
hereof.

(c) Any purported Transfer of Units that is not made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Article 11 shall be null and void and
of no force or effect whatsoever. In the case of a Transfer or attempted Transfer of Units other than pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article 11, the Party
engaging or attempting to engage in such Transfer is obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and the other Member for, from and against all
cost, liability and damage that the Company or such indemnified Member may incur (including incremental tax liabilities, attorneys’ fees and expenses) as a result of
such attempted Transfer and efforts to enforce the indemnity granted hereby.

Section 11.5 Distributions and Allocations in Respect of Transferred Units . If any Units are Transferred during any Fiscal Year in compliance with
the provisions of this Article 11, Profits and Losses, each item thereof and all other items attributable to the Transferred Units for such Fiscal Year will be divided
and allocated between the transferor and the Transferee by taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code Section 706(d),
using any convention permitted by law and selected by the Managing Member. All distributions on or before the date of such Transfer will be made to the transferor
and all distributions thereafter will be made to the Transferee. Any Transfer of a Member’s Unit to a transferor shall be deemed a transfer of such Member’s Interest
and Profit Interest represented by such Unit in relation to the total number of Units owned by such Member immediately prior to such Transfer. Solely for purposes
of making such allocations and distributions, the Company will recognize such Transfer not later than the end of the calendar month during which the Company is
given notice of the Transfer, provided that, if the Company is given notice of a Transfer at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Transfer, the Company will
recognize the Transfer as of the date of the Transfer, and provided further that if the Company does not receive a notice stating the date such Units were transferred
and  such  other  information  as  the  Managing  Member  may  reasonably  require  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  end  of  the  Fiscal  Year  during  which  the  Transfer
occurs, then all such items will be allocated, and all distributions will be made, to the Person who, according to the books and records of the Company, was the
owner  of  the  Units  on  the  last  day  of  such  Fiscal  Year.  Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Managing  Member  will  incur  any  liability  for  making  allocations  and
distributions  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Section  11.5,  whether  or  not  the  Managing  Member  or  the  Company  have  knowledge  of  any  Transfer  of
ownership of any Units.

Section 11.6 Right of First Offer .

(a) Notice . A Member desiring to Transfer Units (other than pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof) (a “Disposing Member”) shall first provide to
the other Members and the Company prior written notice of the Member’s intention to make a Transfer of Units (the “Disposition Notice”), which shall set forth the
number of Units proposed to be Transferred (the “Offered Units”).

(b) Option to the Non-Disposing Member . Upon receipt of the Disposition Notice, the other Member (the “Non-Disposing Member”) has the
right, exercisable within 30 days after receipt of the Disposition Notice (the “Offer Period”), to offer to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Offered Units by
giving written notice to the Disposing Member (the “Offer Notice”) and stating the terms (including the cash purchase price per Unit) on which the Non-Disposing
Member irrevocably offers to purchase all of the Offered Units. The Disposing Member may elect to accept the offer stated in the Offer Notice by giving written
notice (the “Acceptance Notice”) to the Disposing Member within 30 days after receipt of the Offer Notice.

The delivery of the Acceptance Notice shall result in a binding contract between the Disposing Member and the Non-Disposing Member at the price stated in
the  Offer  Notice.  Within  thirty  (30)  days  following  the  receipt  of  the  Acceptance  Notice  or,  if  later,  the  receipt  of  any  required  approvals  from  any  Gaming
Authority, the Disposing Member and the Non-Disposing Member shall complete the sale and purchase of the Units.

(c) Sale  to  a  Third  Party  .  In  the  event  that  the  Disposing  Member  does  not  accept  the  offer  set  forth  in  the  Offer  Notice  (or  if  the  Non-
Disposing Member does not deliver an Offer Notice within the time period contemplated by Section 11.6(b) hereof), the Disposing Member shall have the right to
sell the Units to a third party at a price that is not less than the price set forth in the Offer Notice and other terms and conditions that are not less favorable than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Notice (or, if no Offer Notice was delivered pursuant to Section 11.6(b) hereof, at any price and terms and conditions);
provided, however , that the consummation and closing of such sale must occur within one hundred eighty (180) days after expiration of the Offer Period, provided,
further that such 180-day period may be extended to allow for obtaining any necessary Gaming and regulatory approvals as long as the Disposing Member and the
proposed Transferee of the Disposing Member’s Units are using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approvals. If such sale of the Units is not closed
within such 180-day period, or if the Disposing Member wishes to enter into a contract to sell the Units on terms less than the price set forth in the Offer Notice or on
terms and conditions less favorable than set forth in the Offer Notice, then any subsequent sale of the Units by the Disposing Member may be effected only after
again complying with the conditions of this Section 11.6.

apply to all of the Units held by the Member (versus only the Offered Units ), and (B) th e burden is on the Member with respect to whom there is a Transfer to
construct a transaction in which the Units are separately priced in order to determine whether the requirements of Sections 11.6 hereof and this Section 11.7 have
been met.

Section 11.8 Tag-Along Rights .

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Member (“Selling Member”) may Transfer any or all of its Units to a
Person other than to a Permitted Transferee unless the other Member has the right to sell, in the same transaction, its Units to such Person, on a pro rata basis based
on each Member’s Profit Interest, for a purchase price determined in the identical manner, after giving effect to any adjustments made pursuant to Section 3.5(b)
hereof to the Profit Interest corresponding to such Member’s Units, to the Profit Interest attach, as the purchase price of the Selling Member’s Units shall have been
determined (and subject to identical method of payment and other terms).

(b) As soon as practicable after the Selling Member decides or proposes to sell any or all of its Units, but at least ninety (90) days before the
proposed  date  of  a  sale  of  the  Selling  Member’s  Units,  the  Selling  Member  shall  give  a  written  notice  (the  “Tag-Along  Notice”)  to  the  other  Member  at  each
Member’s  address  as  shown  on  the  Company’s  records.  The  Tag-Along  Notice  shall  describe  in  detail  the  proposed  sale,  including  the  proposed  price  or
consideration to be paid, the name and address of the proposed Transferee, and if the Selling Member is proposing to sell less than all of its Units, the proportion of
their total Units that they intend to sell. The non- Selling Member (“Tagging Member”) shall have the right to sell to the proposed Transferee the same proportion,
based on such Member’s Profit Interest, of such Member’s Units on the terms, subject to adjustments in the price based on any adjustments to each Member’s Profit
Interest previously made pursuant to this Section 3.5(b) hereof, set forth in the Tag-Along Notice. Other than as set forth herein, the terms of the Tag-Along Notice
shall not be more burdensome to the Tagging Member than the terms applicable to the Selling Member in the purchase transaction with the Transferee.

In October 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop a
resort and casino on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”).  The land concession contract became effective when the Macau
government published the agreement in the Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  Under the terms of the land concession
contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to build and open the development by January 2018.

Construction of MGM Cotai commenced in 2013 and it is anticipated to open at the end of the first quarter of 2017. China State Construction Engineering
Corporation serves as the sole general contractor for the project.  MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500
gaming  tables  and  up  to  1,500  slots,  and  featuring  approximately  1,500  hotel  rooms.    The  actual  number  of  gaming  tables  allocated  to  MGM  Cotai  will  be
determined by the Macau government prior to opening,

3

and such allocation may be less than the 500 gaming table capacity. The total estimated project budget is $3.0 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in
consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs.

DESCRIPTION
OF
REGULATION
AND
LICENSING

Exhibit
99.2

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject to

extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located.  These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the
responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations.  Violations of laws in one
jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

In addition to gaming regulations, our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the countries and states in which we
operate.  These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters,
employment and immigration, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, land use, marketing and advertising, timeshare, lending, privacy,
telemarketing, regulations applicable under the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the various reporting and anti-money
laundering regulations.  Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.  Any
material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and
operating results.

Nevada
Government
Regulation

The ownership and operation of our casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the “Nevada Act”), and various local regulations.  Our gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada
Gaming Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”), and various county and city licensing agencies
(the “local authorities”).  The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the local authorities are collectively referred to as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

The laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with,

among other things:

·

·

·

·

·

·

the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices;

the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal
affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;

providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and

providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

Any change in the laws, regulations, and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations.

Each of our subsidiaries that currently operate casinos in Nevada (collectively, the “Nevada casino licensees”) is required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming

Authorities.  Each gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable.  MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, New York-New York Hotel &
Casino, LLC, Bellagio, LLC, MGM Resorts Manufacturing Corp., and Aria Resort & Casino, LLC are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors of gaming
devices (collectively, the “Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees”).  Certain of our subsidiaries have also been licensed or found suitable as shareholders,
members, or general partners, as relevant, of the Nevada casino licensees and of the Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees.  The Nevada casino licensees,
Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees, and the foregoing subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Nevada licensed subsidiaries.”

We, along with Mandalay Resort Group, are required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as publicly traded corporations (collectively, the “Nevada

registered corporations”) and Mirage Resorts, Incorporated is required to be registered as an intermediary company and, as such, each of us is required periodically
to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require.  No person
may become a stockholder or member of, or

receive any percentage of profits from, the Nevada licensed subsidiaries without first registering with (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses and
approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities .   Additionally, the local authorities have taken the position that they have the authority to approve all persons
owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming licensee .   The Nevada registered corporations, Mirage Resorts, Incorporated and the
Nevada licensed subsidiaries have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits, and licenses required in order to
engage in gaming activities in Nevada.

The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, the Nevada registered
corporations or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming
licensee.  Officers, directors, and certain key employees of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be
required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  Officers, directors, and key employees of the Nevada registered corporations who are actively and
directly involved in the gaming activities of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming
Authorities.  The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable.  A finding of
suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation.  The
applicant for licensing or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs
of the investigation.  Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a
finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the
Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries, such Nevada registered corporations or Nevada licensed subsidiaries, as applicable, would have
to sever all relationships with that person.  In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Nevada registered corporations or the Nevada licensed subsidiaries
to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not
subject to judicial review in Nevada.

The Nevada registered corporations and the Nevada casino licensees are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada

Commission.  Substantially all of the Nevada registered corporations’ and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries’ material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similar
financing transactions must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission.

If the Nevada Commission determined that we or a Nevada licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend, or revoke, subject to

compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures, our gaming licenses and those of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries.  In addition, the Nevada registered
corporations and the Nevada licensed subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the
discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the gaming establishments and, under certain
circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the gaming establishments) could be forfeited to the
State of Nevada.  Limitation, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming license
would) materially adversely affect our gaming operations.

Any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or

her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be
inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.  The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in
conducting any such investigation.

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission.  The

Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability
within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing.  Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as
defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a
waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor that has obtained
a waiver may, in certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.

An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course of
business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors, any
change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies, or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission finds
to be inconsistent with holding our

2

voting securities for investment purposes only .   Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only
include:

·

·

·

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders;

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change
in its management, policies, or operations; and

such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial

information including a list of beneficial owners.  The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the

Chairman of the Nevada Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with investigation of
its application, may be found unsuitable.  The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner.  Any
stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed
by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense.  We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a
stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or a Nevada licensed subsidiary, we or any of the Nevada licensed subsidiaries:

·

·

·

·

pays that person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;

allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;

pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including if necessary, the immediate purchase
of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of the Nevada registered corporations to file an application, be

investigated, and be found suitable to hold the debt security.  If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to
the Nevada Act, the registered corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it:

·

·

·

·

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever;

recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or similar transaction.

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time.  If any securities are held in

trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities.  A failure to
make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable.  We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the
beneficial owner.  The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Nevada registered corporations’ stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that such
securities are subject to the Nevada Act.  However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on the Nevada registered corporations.

The Nevada registered corporations may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or

the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those
purposes or for similar purposes.  An approval, if given, does not

3

constitute a finding, recommendation, or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the
investment merits of the securities .   Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

On July 24, 2014, the Nevada Commission granted the Nevada registered corporations prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years,

subject to certain conditions.

Changes in control of the Nevada registered corporations through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or
any act or conduct by a person whereby he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.  Entities seeking to acquire
control of a registered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control
of the registered corporation.  The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material
relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities, and corporate defensive tactics

affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate
gaming.  The Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s
gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to:

·

·

·

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the
current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.  The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of
recapitalization proposed by a registered corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the registered corporation’s stockholders for
the purpose of acquiring control of that corporation.

License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the local
authorities.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly, or annually and are based upon either:

·

·

·

a percentage of the gross revenues received;

the number of gaming devices operated; or

the number of table games operated.

The tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%.  A live entertainment tax is also paid on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of live

entertainment are provided.  The Nevada manufacturer and distributor licensees also pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.

Because we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in

the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of our participation in such foreign gaming.  The revolving fund is subject to
increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the
Nevada Act.  We would be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if we:

·

·

knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

4

·

·

·

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects
or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

employ, contract with, or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on
the ground of personal unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

The sale of alcoholic beverages by the Nevada licensed subsidiaries is subject to licensing, control, and regulation by the applicable local authorities.  All

licenses are revocable and are not transferable.  The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend, or revoke any such license, and any such
disciplinary action could (and revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon our operations.

Michigan
Government
Regulation
and
Taxation

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act (the “Michigan Act”) subjects the owners and operators of casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensing

and regulatory requirements.  The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such local
ordinances regulating casino gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.  We are subject to the Michigan Act through our
ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (the “licensed subsidiary”) which operates MGM Grand Detroit.  Our ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit,
LLC is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.

The Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “Michigan Board”) and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than three

applicants who have entered into development agreements with the City of Detroit.  The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct background
investigations and determine the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated
companies and persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company.  Institutional investors holding less
than certain specified amounts of our debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act since we are a publicly
traded corporation, and provided that the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting our affairs.  Any
person who supplies goods or services to the licensed subsidiary which are directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and any person who
supplies other goods or services to the licensed subsidiary on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from the Michigan Board.  In addition,
any individual employed by the licensed subsidiary or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gaming operation or are performed
in a restricted area or a gaming area of the licensed subsidiary must obtain an occupational license from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license.  The applicant

must establish its suitability as to integrity, moral character and reputation, business probity, financial ability and experience, responsibility, and other criteria
deemed appropriate by the Michigan Board.  A casino license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determination
that the licensee no longer meets the requirements for licensure.

The Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict the licensed subsidiary’s casino license.  The licensed subsidiary is also subject to
fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules.  In the event that the licensed subsidiary’s license is revoked or suspended for
more than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is required to preserve the assets to ensure that they
shall continue to be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the Michigan Board, to sell or otherwise transfer the assets to another person or
entity who meets the requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain approvals and consultations.

The Michigan Board has adopted administrative rules to implement the terms of the Michigan Act.  Among other things, the rules impose more detailed

substantive and procedural requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations.

Included are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the Michigan

Board, internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership
interests in licensed casinos.  The rules also establish numerous

5

Michigan Board procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary and other hearings, and similar matters .   The rules have the force of law and are binding on the
Michigan Board as well as on applicants for or holders of casino licenses.

Under rules of the Michigan Board, a person or company which intends to acquire shares representing more than a 5% equity interest in a publicly traded

company which is the holding company of a Michigan casino licensee must obtain approval of the acquisition from the Michigan Board.  Subsequent to the
acquisition, the person or company acquiring the shares must be determined by the Michigan Board to be “suitable” and “qualified” to own the shares.  In addition, if
the acquisition is by a company, “key persons” in the company (generally the officers, directors, managerial employees, and significant owners) must also be
determined to be “suitable” and “qualified.” “Institutional investors” (as that term is defined in the Michigan Act) may generally obtain a waiver from these
requirements if the institutional investor has less than 15% ownership interest in the publicly traded company.  Upon attaining equity ownership of 5% or more, or
filing Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC, the Michigan Board must be notified by the investor.  Unless otherwise ordered by the Michigan Board, institutional
investors acquiring less than 10% equity ownership in the publicly traded company are entitled to an exemption from the approval requirements, but are required to
file an institutional waiver application with the Michigan Board.  Institutional investors acquiring 10% or more equity ownership must apply for an institutional
waiver, supplying certain information delineated in Rule 504(3).  Pursuant to Rule 504(4), institutional investors acquiring more than 15% equity ownership must
apply to the Michigan Board for approval of the acquisition within 45 days after it occurs.  The institutional investor and its key persons may be subject to suitability
and qualification determinations.

The term “institutional investor” includes financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, etc.  The shares held by the institutional
investor must be held for investment purposes only.  The following activities are deemed consistent with holding the shares for investment purposes:  voting by
proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted on by the holders of the voting securities; serving as a member of a committee of creditors or security
holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring; nominating a candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt
restructuring; accepting appointment or election as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the
conclusion of the member’s term; making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for information purposes and
not to cause a change in its management, policies, or operations; and other activities that the board determines to be consistent with the investment intent.

The Michigan Liquor Control Commission licenses, controls and regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages by the licensed subsidiary pursuant to the Michigan

Liquor Control Code of 1998.  The Michigan Act also requires that the licensed subsidiary sell in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Code.

The Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and

Compliance.”  The ordinance authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which
has been approved and certified by the City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties.  The development agreement among the City of
Detroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in
effect.  Under the ordinance, the licensed subsidiary is required to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding its compliance
with the development agreement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply.  The ordinance requires the
Mayor of Detroit to monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and to
notify the City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of
such action to the Michigan Board within five business days along with Detroit’s request that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s casino license.  If a
development agreement is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit.

The administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit the licensed subsidiary or us from entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization or

financial viability of MGM Grand Detroit without prior approval from the Michigan Board.  On October 14, 2003, the Michigan Board authorized the licensed
subsidiary to borrow under our credit facilities for the purpose of financing the development of its permanent casino and any future expansion of, or maintenance
capital expenditures for, the permanent casino, and to secure such borrowings with liens upon substantially all of its assets.  In the same order, the Michigan Board
authorized MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.  to pledge its equity interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to secure such borrowings.  Enforcement of a security interest in such
equity interest is limited by the Michigan Act and the rules of the Michigan Board.  Specifically, acquisitions resulting in an interest of more than one percent of an
entity, other than a publicly traded corporation, holding a casino license are subject to the approval of the Michigan Board, and persons acquiring such interests must
be found suitable by the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act effectively provides for a wagering tax equal to 19% of adjusted gross receipts from gaming operations conducted at a casino.  Proceeds of

the wagering tax are shared between the State of Michigan and the City of Detroit.  In addition to

6

the wagering tax, the Michigan Act establishes an annual municipal service fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of adjusted gross receipts to be paid to
Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment, as adjusted annually based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount of
approximately $8.3 million to be paid to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement and other casino-related costs .   These payments are in addition to the taxes,
fees and assessments customarily paid by business entities situated in Detroit .   The licensed subsidiary is also obligated to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to
Detroit, to be increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in any calendar year in which adjusted gross receipts exceed $400 million.

Mississippi
Government
Regulation

We conduct our Mississippi gaming operations through two indirect subsidiaries, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., which owns and operates Beau Rivage in Biloxi,

Mississippi, and MGM Resorts Mississippi, Inc., which owns and operates the Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi (collectively, the “casino
licensees”).  The ownership and operation of casino facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and
regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue.

The Mississippi Gaming Control Act (the “Mississippi Act”) legalized casino gaming in Mississippi.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations

in furtherance of the Mississippi Act.  The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to:

·

·

·

·

·

·

prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;

maintain effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding
of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission;

prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;

provide a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and

ensure that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents.

The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or the
Mississippi Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have a
material adverse effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if the
voters in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county.  As of December 31, 2015, gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the
state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties.  Prior to Hurricane Katrina,
Mississippi law required that gaming vessels be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the
waters of the State of Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, changes to the law
became effective which allowed gaming facilities to be constructed on land in the three Gulf Coast counties, provided that no portion of the gaming facilities is
located more than 800 feet from the mean high water line of the Mississippi Sound or designated bays on the Sound.  The 800-foot limit does not apply to non-
gaming facilities.  The law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored dockside vessels or in land-based facilities on a 24-hour basis and does not
restrict the percentage of space which may be utilized for gaming.  There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi.

The casino licensees are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Gaming licenses require the periodic payment
of fees and taxes and are not transferable.  Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter.  The current
licenses of the casino licensees are effective through June 22, 2018.

We are registered by the Mississippi Gaming Commission under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of the casino licensees.  As a
registered publicly traded corporation, we are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodically
submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information which the Mississippi Gaming
Commission may require.  If we are unable to satisfy

7

the registration requirements of the Mississippi Act, we and our casino licensees cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi .   The casino licensees are
also required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of
Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby .   With certain exceptions, no person may become a stockholder of or receive any percentage of
profits from the casino licensees without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Certain of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We believe that we have
applied for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional
persons to file applications for findings of suitability.  In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found
suitable, in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation.  A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personal
and financial information followed by a thorough investigation.  There can be no assurance that a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be found
suitable by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that it
deems reasonable.  Findings of suitability must be periodically renewed.

Changes in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding

of suitability, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the
power to require us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate
applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities.

Employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to

issue a work permit to a person convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed various
misdemeanors or knowingly violated the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause.

At any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to investigate and require a finding of suitability of any of our record or beneficial
stockholders, regardless of the percentage of ownership.  Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report the
acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable.  Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more
than 10% of our voting securities, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission.  An applicant for finding of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of a

registered public or private company’s voting securities.  However, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutional
investors to own beneficially up to 15% and, under certain circumstances, up to 19%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding of
suitability.  Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a
waiver of a finding of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in certain circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of a
registered or licensed company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment purposes only.  An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting
securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for
the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered or licensed company, any change in
the registered or licensed company’s corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public or private company or any of its gaming
affiliates, or any other action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or licensed company’s voting securities
for investment purposes only.

Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

·

·

·

·

voting, directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such voting
securities;

serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in connection with a debt restructuring;

nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring;

accepting appointment or election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a
debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s term;

8

·

·

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change
in management, policies or operations; and

such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of

beneficial owners.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered
public company’s equity interests for any cause it deems reasonable.

We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any of our debt or other securities.  In
addition, under the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders of our debt securities to file applications, investigate
the holders, and require the holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities.

Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found

suitable, the Mississippi Gaming Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt
instrument exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question.  Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of
suitability must pay all investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming

Commission may be found unsuitable.  Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the time
that the Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor.  After receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holder
of our debt securities or to have any other relationship with us, we will be subject to disciplinary action if we:

·

·

·

·

·

pay the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or other distribution whatsoever;

recognize the exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person;

pay the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances;

make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediate
purchase of the securities for cash at a fair market value.

The casino licensees must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity securities and we must maintain in Mississippi a

current list of our stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by us.  The ledger and stockholder
lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time.  If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the
record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  A failure to make that disclosure may be
grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable.  We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

The Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that the
securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  On May 28, 2009, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
granted us a waiver of this legend requirement.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our
securities at any time.

Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by the casino licensees must be reported to or approved by the Mississippi

Gaming Commission.  The licensed subsidiaries may not make a public offering of their securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities with the prior
approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire
or extend obligations incurred for those purposes.  The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of

9

the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering .   Effective June 23, 2015 , the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver
of the prior approval requirement for our securities offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions .   The waiver may be rescinded for good cause
without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Under the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the casino licensees may not guarantee a security issued by us pursuant to a public offering, or

pledge their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by us, without the prior approval of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission.  Similarly, we may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of the casino licensees, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interests
foreclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by
us and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by us are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The waiver of
the prior approval requirement for our securities offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission effective June 23, 2015 includes a waiver of the prior
approval requirement for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of the casino licensees, subject to certain conditions.

We cannot change our control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without the

prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and
other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval
process relating to the transaction.

The Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate
defensive tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be
injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming.  The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse
effects of these business practices upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming
operators and their affiliates, preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form, and promote a neutral environment for the orderly
governance of corporate affairs.

We may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before we may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess

of the current market price of its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before we may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by
management.  The regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if we adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by our Board of
Directors opposing a tender offer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of us.

Neither we nor the casino licensees may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while we, the casino licensees and/or persons found suitable to be associated

with the gaming license of the casino licensees conduct gaming operations outside of Mississippi without approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.  The
Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it have access to information concerning our, and our affiliates’, out-of-state gaming operations.  We believe that
we have applied for all necessary waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for the conduct of our active or planned gaming
operations outside of Mississippi.

If the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that the casino licensees violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit,

condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary.  In addition, we, the casino licensees and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for
each separate violation.  A violation under any of our other operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of the casino licensees’ gaming
license.

Because of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities.  Limitation, conditioning or

suspension of the casino licensees’ gaming license or our registration as a publicly traded holding company, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and the
revocation of any gaming license or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations.

The casino licensees must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to

the county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations.  Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable
either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the number
of table games operated by the casino.

The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gross revenues,” generally defined as cash receipts less cash payouts to customers as
winnings, and generally equals 8% of gross revenue.  These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid.  The
gross revenue fee imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in which

10

casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi and equals approximately 4% of gross revenue.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s plan

include a 500-car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casino
cost.  Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities.  Beau
Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in compliance with this requirement.  On January 21, 1999, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this
regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%; however, the regulation grandfathers existing licensees and applies only to
new casino projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would therefore not apply to Beau Rivage and Gold Strike
Tunica.  In any event, Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica would comply with such requirement.  On February 21, 2013, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
adopted further amendments to this regulation to impose additional requirements on new casino projects.  However, the amended regulation grandfathers any
licensee who has been licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission prior to December 31, 2013; therefore, the amendments do not apply to Beau Rivage or Gold
Strike Tunica.

Both the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue license, control and regulate the sale of
alcoholic beverages by the casino licensees.  Beau Rivage and Gold Strike Tunica are in areas designated as special resort areas, which allows casinos located therein
to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis.  The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that our key officers and managers and the casino licensees’ key
officers and managers and all owners of more than 5% of the casino licensees’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial information to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed.  All such licenses are non-transferable.  The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the full
power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions.  Any
disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino’s operations.

Illinois
Government
Regulation

Our 50% joint venture ownership interest in Grand Victoria Riverboat Casino, located in Elgin, Illinois (“Grand Victoria”) is subject to extensive state

regulation under the Illinois Riverboat Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) and the regulations of the Illinois Gaming Board (the “Illinois Board”).

In February 1990, the State of Illinois legalized riverboat gambling.  The Illinois Act authorizes the Illinois Board to issue up to ten riverboat gaming owners’

licenses on any water within the State of Illinois or any water other than Lake Michigan which constitutes a boundary of the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Act
restricts the location of certain of the ten owners’ licenses.  Three of the licenses must be located on the Mississippi River.  One license must be at a location on the
Illinois River south of Marshall County and another license must be located on the Des Plaines River in Will County.  The remaining licenses are not restricted as to
location.  Currently, all ten owner’s licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East St.  Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island, Des Plaines, and two
licenses in Joliet.

The Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations.  It grants the Illinois Board specific powers and

duties, and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing the
system of riverboat gaming.  The Illinois Board has authority over every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming
operations in the State of Illinois.

The Illinois Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an owner’s license issued by the Illinois Board.  Each owner’s license permits the
holder to own up to two riverboats as part of its gaming operation; however, gaming participants are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license.  The number of gaming
participants will be determined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time.  Gaming positions are counted as follows:

·

·

·

positions for electronic gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total number of devices available for play;

craps tables will be counted as having ten gaming positions; and

games utilizing live gaming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions.

Each owner’s license initially runs for a period of three years.  Thereafter, the license must be renewed annually.  The Board may renew an owner’s license for
up to four years.  An owner licensee is eligible for renewal upon payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Board that the licensee continues
to meet all of the requirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois Board’s

11

rules .   The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and was renewed for a four-year period that ends in October 2016 .   An ownership
interest in an owner’s license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior approval of the Illinois Board.

Pursuant to the Illinois Act, the Illinois Board established certain rules to follow in deciding whether to approve direct or indirect ownership or control of an
owner’s license.  The Illinois Board must consider the impact of any economic concentration caused by the ownership or control.  No direct or indirect ownership or
control may be approved which will result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a riverboat gambling operation in Illinois.  The Illinois Act specifies
a number of criteria for the Illinois Board to consider in determining whether the approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will create undue economic
concentration.  The application of such criteria could reduce the number of potential purchasers for the Grand Victoria or our 50% joint venture interest therein.

The Illinois Act does not limit the maximum bet or per patron loss.  Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the holder of the owner’s

license.  Wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency.  No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager and wagers only may be
received from a person present on the riverboat.  With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% or more than 100%.

Illinois imposes a number of taxes on Illinois casinos.  Such taxes are subject to change by the Illinois legislature and have been increased in the past.  The
Illinois legislature also may impose new taxes on Grand Victoria’s activities.  Illinois currently imposes an admission tax of $2.00 per person for an owner licensee
that admitted 1,000,000 persons or fewer in the 2004 calendar year, and $3.00 per person for all other owner licensees (including Grand Victoria).

Additionally, Illinois imposes a wagering tax on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined in the Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation.  The owner licensee is

required, on a daily basis, to wire the wagering tax payment to the Illinois Board.  Currently, the wagering tax is:

·

·

·

·

·

·

·

15.0% of adjusted gross receipts up to and including $25.0 million;

22.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $25.0 million but not exceeding $50.0 million;

27.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $50.0 million but not exceeding $75.0 million;

32.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $75.0 million but not exceeding $100.0 million;

37.5% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $100.0 million but not exceeding $150.0 million;

45.0% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $150.0 million but not exceeding $200.0 million; and

50.0% of adjusted gross receipts in excess of $200.0 million.

A holder of any gaming license in Illinois is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act

by the licensee or the licensee’s agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of
Illinois, or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois.  The Illinois Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as the
Illinois Board may determine and, in compliance with applicable Illinois law regarding administrative procedures, may suspend an owner’s license, without notice or
hearing, upon a determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat’s operation.  The suspension may remain in
effect until the Illinois Board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owner’s license upon a determination that the owner has
not made satisfactory progress toward abating the hazard.

If the Illinois Board has suspended, revoked or refused to renew an owner’s license or if a riverboat gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarily

surrendering its owner’s license, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver.  The circuit
court has sole jurisdiction over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment of a receiver.  The Illinois Board specifies the specific powers, duties and limitations
of the receiver.

12

The Illinois Board requires that each “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated and
approved by the Illinois Board .   The Illinois Board determines which positions, individuals or Business Entities are required to be approved by the Board as Key
Persons .   Once approved, such Key Person status must be maintained .   Key Persons include:

·

·

·

·

any Business Entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trust
holding such ownership interest or voting rights;

the directors of the licensee or applicant and its chief executive officer, president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents;

a Gaming Operations Manager or any other business entity or individual who has influence and/or control over the conduct of gaming or the Riverboat
Gaming Operation; and

all other individuals or Business Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Board
determines hold a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Board for
the specified licensee or applicant.

Each owner licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order of

the Illinois Board.  Based upon findings from an investigation into the character, reputation, experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of a
Key Person, the Illinois Board may enter an order upon the licensee or require the economic disassociation of the Key Person.

Applicants for and holders of an owner’s license are required to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval for changes in the following:  (i) Key Persons; (ii) type of

entity; (iii) equity and debt capitalization of the entity; (iv) investors and/or debt holders; (v) source of funds; (vi) applicant’s economic development plan;
(vii) riverboat capacity or significant design change; (viii) gaming positions; (ix) anticipated economic impact; or (x) agreements, oral or written, relating to the
acquisition or disposition of property (real or personal) of a value greater than $1 million.  Illinois regulations provide that a holder of an owner’s license may make
distributions to its stockholders only to the extent that such distributions do not impair the financial viability of the owner.

The Illinois Board requires each holder of an owner’s license to obtain the Illinois Board’s approval prior to issuing a guaranty of any

indebtedness.  Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries with a direct interest in Grand Victoria intend to petition the Illinois Board to allow those subsidiaries to issue
subsidiary guaranties of any indebtedness that we incur in the future to the extent such guaranties are required by our lenders.  Although we and those subsidiaries
believe the Illinois Board will continue to approve our petitions and allow such guaranties of our future indebtedness, there can be no assurance that the Illinois
Board will continue to grant the necessary approvals.

The Illinois Board requires that each “institutional investor,” as that term is defined by Illinois Board, that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively
acquires, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall,
within no less than ten days after acquiring such securities, notify the Illinois Board of such ownership and shall, upon request, provide such additional information
as may be required by the Illinois Board.  An institutional investor that, individually or jointly with others, cumulatively acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more
of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall file an “Institutional Investor Disclosure Form,”
provided by the Illinois Board, within 45 days after cumulatively acquiring such level of ownership interest, unless such requirement is waived by the Illinois
Board.  Based upon the current position of the Illinois Board, ownership interest in a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation is calculated based on the
publicly-traded parent corporation’s ownership in the licensee.  Accordingly, an institutional investor that owns 5% of any class of our voting securities should only
be considered a 2.5% owner for the basis of the regulations of the Illinois Board based on our 50% ownership in Grand Victoria.  Additionally, we must notify the
Illinois Board as soon as possible after we become aware that we are involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor.

The Illinois Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public and

the gaming industry.  Also, the Illinois Board may, from time to time, amend or change its rules.

On January 1, 2008, Illinois’ statewide public smoking ban became effective.  Smoking is now illegal in Illinois’ casinos, bars, restaurants and other public

establishments.  This may continue to negatively impact the gaming industry in Illinois.

From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the Illinois legislature that, if enacted, would affect the taxation, regulation, operation or other

aspects of the gaming industry.  The Illinois legislature regularly considers proposals that would expand

13

gaming opportunities in Illinois .   Some of this legislation, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry .   No assurance can be given whether such or
similar legislation will be enacted.

The Illinois legislature continues to discuss the possibility of gaming expansion.  This expansion could include several new casinos (including one in Chicago),

increased gaming positions in existing casinos, as well as gaming positions at Illinois racetracks.  If gaming expansion occurs, Grand Victoria’s operating results
could be adversely impacted by the increased competition.

On July 13, 2009, Illinois enacted the Video Gaming Act, which legalizes the use of up to five video gaming terminals in most bars, restaurants, fraternal
organizations and veterans’ organizations holding valid Illinois liquor licenses, as well as at qualifying truck stops.  The Illinois Board adopted a set of Regulations
and continues to release new or emergency Regulations, as necessary, to implement and regulate the Video Gaming Act.  Effective October 9, 2012, video gaming in
Illinois became operational.  The video gaming terminals in licensed establishments allow patrons to play games such as video poker, line up and blackjack.   In
December 2015, over ,200 licensed establishments were operating nearly 22,000 video gaming terminals.  Grand Victoria’s revenues may be adversely impacted by
the availability of video gaming terminals in non-casino establishments proximately located to its customer base.

Macau
S.A.R.

Laws
and
Regulations

MGM Grand Paradise is regulated as a gaming operator under applicable Macau law and our ownership interest in MGM Grand Paradise is subject to

continuing regulatory scrutiny.  We are required to be approved by the Macau government (gaming authorities) to own an interest in a gaming operator.  Authorized
gaming operators must pay periodic fees and taxes, and gaming rights are not transferable, unless approved by the Macau government.  MGM Grand Paradise must
periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macau gaming authorities and furnish any other information that the Macau gaming authorities
may require.  No person may acquire any rights over the shares or assets of MGM Grand Paradise without first obtaining the approval of the Macau gaming
authorities.  The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of MGM Grand Paradise or other rights relating to such
shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons or entities other than the original owners, would require the
approval of the Macau government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macau gaming authorities.  The stock of MGM Grand Paradise and
its casinos, assets and equipment shall not be subject to any liens or encumbrances, except under authorization by the Macau government.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract requires approval of the Macau government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any of
the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that is
equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM Grand Paradise.  Under the subconcession contract, this approval requirement does not apply to securities
that are listed and tradable on a stock market.  Since MGM Grand Paradise’s securities are not listed and tradable on a stock market this approval requirement applies
to transfers of MGM Grand Paradise’s shares.  In addition, this contract requires that the Macau government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or
the grant of voting rights or other stockholders’ rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in MGM Grand
Paradise, including us, provided that such shares or rights are indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of the share capital in MGM
Grand Paradise.  This notice requirement will not apply, however, to securities listed and tradable on a stock exchange.

MGM Grand Paradise is in no case allowed to delegate the management of gaming operations to a management company, and is in no case allowed to enter
into a management contract by which its managing powers are or might be assumed by a third party.  Any act or contract by which MGM Grand Paradise assigns,
transfers, alienates or creates liens or encumbrances on gaming operations to or in favor of a third party is prohibited, unless previously approved by the Macau
government.

The Macau gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, MGM Grand Paradise to
determine whether MGM Grand Paradise’s suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by that individual.  MGM Grand Paradise shareholders with 5% or more
of the share capital and directors must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, and
accept the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macau government.  MGM Grand Paradise is required to immediately notify the
Macau government should MGM Grand Paradise become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% or
more of the share capital, or any director or key employee.  Changes in approved corporate positions must be reported to the Macau gaming authorities.  The Macau
gaming authorities have jurisdiction to deny an application for a finding of suitability.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macau gaming authorities may be found unsuitable.  Any

stockholder subject to a suitability process who is found unsuitable must transfer their shares to a third party within a term set by the Macau government.  If such
transfer is not consummated, MGM Grand Paradise must acquire those shares.  If any officer, director or key employee is found unsuitable, MGM Grand Paradise
must sever all relationships with that

14

person .   In case of failure to act in accordance thereof, MGM Grand Paradise would become subject to administrative sanctions and penalties.

The Macau government must give their prior approval to changes in control of MGM Grand Paradise through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset
acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control.  Entities seeking to acquire control of a
registered corporation must satisfy the Macau government concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control.  The Macau gaming authorities may
also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control,
to be considered suitable as part of the approval process of the transaction.

The Macau gaming authorities also have the power to supervise gaming operators in order to assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and

their affiliates.

The subconcession contract requires the Macau gaming authorities’ prior approval of any recapitalization plan, any increase of the capital stock by public
subscription, any issue of preferential shares or any creation, issue or transformation of types or series of shares representative of MGM Grand Paradise capital stock,
as well as any change in the constituent documents (i.e., articles of association) of MGM Grand Paradise.  The Chief Executive of Macau could also require MGM
Grand Paradise to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary.

MGM Macau was constructed and is operated under MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract.  This subconcession excludes the following gaming
activities:  mutual bets, gaming activities provided to the public, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships or
planes.  MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession is exclusively governed by Macau law.  MGM Grand Paradise is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
Macau in case of any potential dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.

MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession contract expires on March 31, 2020.  Unless the subconcession is extended, on that date, all casino operations and

related equipment in MGM Macau will automatically be transferred to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise and MGM Resorts
International will cease to generate any revenues from these operations.  Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession by
giving MGM Grand Paradise at least one year prior notice and by paying fair compensation or indemnity.

The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption.

The Macau government also has the right to unilaterally terminate, without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, the subconcession at any time upon the

occurrence of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the
subconcession contract.  If the default is curable, the Macau gaming authorities are required to give MGM Grand Paradise prior notice to cure the default, though no
specific cure period for that purpose is provided.

The subconcession contract contains various general covenants and obligations and other provisions, the compliance with which is subjective.  MGM Grand

Paradise has the following obligations under the subconcession contract:

·

·

·

·

ensure the proper operation and conduct of casino games;

employ people with appropriate qualifications;

operate and conduct casino games of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities; and

safeguard and ensure Macau’s interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas.

The subconcession contract requires MGM Grand Paradise Limited to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance which are in place.

MGM Grand Paradise Limited is also subject to certain reporting requirements to the Macau gaming authorities.

Under the subconcession, MGM Grand Paradise Limited is obligated to pay to the Macau S.A.R.  an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable
portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated.  The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas
(approximately $3.9 million, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2015).  The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively
for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000

15

patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine, including slot machines (approximately $3 8 , 7 00 , $1 9 ,
4 00 and $12 9 , respectively, based on exchange rates at December 31, 2015 ), subject to a minimum of forty five million patacas (approximately $5. 8  million,
based on exchange rates at December 31, 2015 ) .   MGM Grand Paradise Limited also has to pay a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenues and
applicable withholding taxes .   It must also contribute 1.6% and 2.4% (a portion of which must be used for promotion of tourism in Macau) of its gross gaming
revenue to a public foundation designated by the Macau S.A.R . government and to the Macau S.A.R, respectively, as special levy.

Currently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue.  However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for
credit losses.  As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it has to
pay taxes on its winnings from these customers even though it was unable to collect the related receivables.

MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use a 10.67 acre parcel of land for MGM Macau (the “MGM Macau Land

Contract”).  The land concession will expire on April 6, 2031 and is renewable.

The MGM Macau Land Contract requires MGM Grand Paradise to pay a premium which was paid in full before the opening of MGM Macau.  In addition,
MGM Grand Paradise is also obligated to pay rent annually for the term of the MGM Macau Land Contract.  The rent amount may be revised every five years by the
Macau government, according to the provisions of the Macau Land law.

In addition, MGM Grand Paradise has received a concession from the Macau government to use an approximately 18 acre site in Cotai Macau and develop a
second resort and casino (the “Cotai Land Contract”).   The land concession contract became effective on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years.  The
total land premium payable to the Macau government for the land concession contract is $161 million and is composed of a down payment and eight additional semi-
annual payments.  As of December 31, 2015, MGM China had paid $130 million of the contract premium.  In January 2016, MGM China paid the fourth semi-
annual payment of $15 million under the land concession contract.  Including interest on the four remaining semi-annual payments, MGM China has $99 million
remaining payable for the land concession contract.  Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to complete the development
of the land by January 2018.

MGM Grand Paradise received an exemption from Macau’s corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for a period

of five-years starting at January 1, 2007.  In October 2011, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of this exemption for an additional five years.  The
exemption runs through December 31, 2016.

Maryland
Government
Regulation

The Maryland State Lottery Video Lottery Terminal Law (“Maryland VLT Law”) subjects the owners and operators of video lottery facilities to extensive state
licensing and regulatory requirements.  We are subject to the Maryland VLT Law and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in
MGM National Harbor, LLC, which is expected to operate a video lottery facility in Prince George’s County, Maryland, which facility is currently scheduled for
completion in the fourth quarter of 2016 (the “National Harbor Project”).

Under the Maryland VLT Law, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (“Maryland Commission”), in conjunction with the Maryland Lottery

and Gaming Control Agency (“Maryland Agency”), maintains authority to regulate the operation of video lottery terminals and tables games within the State of
Maryland, and to issue video lottery operation licenses to qualified applicants.  The Maryland Video Lottery Facility Location Commission (“Maryland Location
Commission”) has the authority to award up to six video lottery operation licenses within the State of Maryland and is responsible for evaluating competing
proposals and awarding the video lottery operation licenses to applicants based on business and market, economic development and location siting factors.  The
Maryland Location Commission cannot award a video lottery operation license to an applicant until the Maryland Commission determines that the applicant is
qualified.  On October 10, 2013, the Maryland Commission determined that MGM National Harbor, LLC and all applicable principals were qualified, and on
December 23, 2013, the Maryland Location Commission awarded the video lottery operation license in Prince George’s County, Maryland to MGM National
Harbor, LLC.  MGM National Harbor, LLC was awarded the sixth and final video lottery operation license in Maryland.

Once a video lottery operation license is awarded, the Maryland Commission may issue the license if the, as developed, video lottery facility is consistent in all
material respects with that proposed by the applicant to the Maryland Location Commission, meets applicable state and local requirements, for example, zoning, land
use, and transportation approvals or permits, and the applicant continues to meet qualification and other regulatory requirements.

16

Once the video lottery operation license is issued, the initial license term of 15 years will commence .   The initial license fee is based on the number of video
lottery terminals proposed within the video lottery facility .   As 3,600 video lottery terminals were proposed for the National Harbor Project, our initial license fee
was $21 million, and the Maryland Location Commission determined that the National Harbor Project may have up to 3,600 terminals .   Within 1 year of the end of
the initial 15–year license term, a video lottery operation licensee may reapply for a license that has a license term of 10 years and a license fee to be established by
statute.

Under the Maryland VLT Law, video lottery terminals each must have an average payout percentage of at least 87%.  Video lottery facilities are permitted to

operate 24 hours a day, and patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  While alcohol may be offered in the video lottery facility, it may not be offered free of
charge.  The Maryland VLT Law and regulations also impose various restrictions on check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other transactions within
the video lottery facility.

The Maryland Commission has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for a video lottery operation
license, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, directors, officers, key management employees, principals, partners, and other persons or entities holding a five
percent or greater interest in the applicant, are qualified under the Maryland VLT Law.

The Maryland VLT Law provides that institutional investors may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements, and an Institutional Investor Waiver
Application may be submitted for entities holding an interest in an applicant or licensee that are considered institutional investors.  The term “institutional investor”
generally includes insurance companies, banks and financial institutions, investment companies, trusts and advisors, pension funds, etc.  The Maryland
Commission’s decision concerning whether to grant a waiver is discretionary, and based on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the institutional
investor’s securities, whether the investor is substantially involved in the video lottery operations of the licensee, and the investor’s gaming licensure history in other
jurisdictions.

After a video lottery operation license is awarded and/or issued, the Maryland Commission has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the

licensee and its officers, directors, and other designated persons.  The Maryland Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or restrict a video lottery
operation license, and may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  The licensee’s participation in video lottery and table game operations is
expressly deemed a revocable privilege under the Maryland VLT Law, conditioned on the proper and continued qualification of the licensee and the licensee meeting
reporting requirements and continuing to provide any assistance and information necessary to the Maryland regulators.  Each licensee has an affirmative
responsibility to provide an annual update of applicable licensing information to the Maryland Commission.  Among other things, the Maryland Commission is also
responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations into the operation of video lottery terminals and table games, and
reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct unannounced inspections of the video lottery facility premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.

The regulations promulgated to implement the Maryland VLT Law impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to video lottery licensing

and ongoing operations.  The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning:  licensing investigations and hearings; marketing controls and
standards; internal control standards related to accounting, finance and statistics, audits, record retention, complimentaries, surveillance, security, cage and customer
transactions, promotions, and other gaming related controls; facility design standards; table games surveillance; gaming floor plans; the transportation and testing of
video lottery terminals and table games equipment; the registration of video lottery terminals and table games; voluntary and mandatory patron exclusion;
responsible gaming; and junket enterprises and representatives.  Applicants and licensees must also meet requirements concerning minority business participation,
provide health insurance and retirement benefits for employees, and give preference to hiring employees located within ten miles of the video lottery facility.

Generally, a video lottery operation license may not be transferred, assigned or pledged as collateral without approval from the Maryland

Commission.  Specifically, a licensee cannot sell or transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interests in the licensee unless the Maryland Commission is
notified and determines that the buyer or transferee meets all applicable qualification and regulatory requirements.  If the licensee fails to meet these requirements,
the applicable license will be automatically revoked ninety days after the transfer or sale.  Entities and individuals are also prohibited from owning an interest in
more than one video lottery facility, and any application to the Maryland Location Commission to apply for an additional license must include a plan for divesting
the applicable interest in the initial license.  Applicants seeking investors in an entity applying for a video lottery operation license must make serious, good-faith
efforts to solicit and interview a reasonable number of minority investors before a license will be awarded by the Maryland Location Commission, and following the
award, must again make serious, good-faith efforts to interview minority investors in any future attempts to raise venture capital or attract new investors to the entity
awarded the license.

The Maryland Commission retains the authority to recommend or propose changes to the Maryland VLT Law, and may amend or change regulations

concerning the Maryland VLT Law, which, if enacted, could adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Maryland.

New
Jersey
Government
Regulation

Our ownership of 50% of Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey subjects us to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “NJ Act”) and various other statutes and regulations.  The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (“NJ
Commission”) and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (“NJ Division” and, together with the NJ Commission, the “NJ Gaming Authorities”) are, to
varying degrees, empowered to regulate a wide spectrum of gaming and non-gaming related activities and to approve the form of ownership and financial structure
of not only a casino licensee, but also its holding and intermediary companies and entity qualifiers.

The NJ Commission issues casino licenses and casino key employee licenses and the NJ Division issues all other types of licenses, including permits to conduct

intrastate Internet gaming and registrations and licenses to persons who provide goods or services to a casino.  The NJ Division also is responsible for investigating
all license applications and for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the requirements of the NJ Act.

On June 24, 2010, the NJ Commission renewed Borgata’s casino license effective July 1, 2010 for a term which became indefinite by operation of

law.  However, no later than five years after the issuance of a casino license, and approximately every five years thereafter, the casino licensee and its qualifying
entities and individuals must submit information to the NJ Gaming Authorities to demonstrate their continuing qualification.  In addition, the NJ Commission may
reopen the license hearing at any time, and the NJ Commission must do so at the request of the NJ Division.  In September 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries
were found qualified as holding companies of Borgata, the trust holding our interest in Borgata was dissolved, and all of the trust property assets, including $83
million of cash, were transferred to us.

Pursuant to the NJ Act and applicable precedent, no entity may hold a casino license unless each officer, director, person who directly or indirectly holds any

beneficial interest or ownership of the securities of the licensee, each person who in the opinion of the Director of the NJ Division has the ability to control or elect a
majority of the board of directors of the licensee (other than a banking or other licensed lending institution acting in the ordinary course of business) and each of its
holding, intermediary or subsidiary companies, obtains and maintains qualification approval from the NJ Gaming Authorities.

Persons holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding or intermediary company are presumed to have the ability to control the company or elect one

or more of its directors and will, unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or the qualification requirement is waived, be required to
individually qualify.  Equity securities are defined in the NJ Act as any voting stock or any other security having a direct or indirect participation in the profits of the
issuer.  Notwithstanding either the presumption of control for holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a holding company or the requirement that a casino
licensee establish and maintain the qualification of certain holders of debt securities, the NJ Act provides for a waiver of qualification for passive “institutional
investors,” as defined by the NJ Act under certain circumstances.

Casino licensees are also required to establish and maintain the qualifications of any financial backer, investor, mortgagee, bondholder, or holder of indentures,

notes or other evidences of indebtedness, either in effect or proposed which bears any relation to the casino operation or casino hotel premises who holds 25% or
more of such financial instruments or other evidences of indebtedness; provided, however, in circumstances of default, persons holding 10% of such financial
instruments or evidences of indebtedness shall be required to establish and maintain their qualifications.  Persons who hold less than these thresholds may be
required to establish and maintain their qualifications in the discretion of the Director of the NJ Division.  Banks and licensed lending institutions, however, are
exempt from any qualification requirements if they are acting in the ordinary course of business.

The NJ Act imposes certain restrictions upon the issuance, ownership and transfer of securities of a casino licensee and its holding and intermediary companies and
defines the term “security” to include instruments which evidence a direct or indirect beneficial ownership or creditor interest, including stock (common and
preferred) mortgages, debentures, security agreements, notes, warrants, options and rights.  If the NJ Commission finds that a holder of such securities is not
qualified under the NJ Act, it has the right to take any remedial action deemed appropriate including the right to force divestiture by such disqualified holder of such
securities.  In the event that certain disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, the NJ Commission has the power to revoke or suspend the casino
license or licenses related to the company which issued the securities.  It is unlawful for a disqualified holder (i) to exercise, directly or through any trustee or
nominee, any right conferred by such securities or (ii) to receive any dividends or interest upon such securities or any remuneration, in any form, from its affiliated
casino licensee for services rendered or otherwise.

The NJ Act requires our certificate of incorporation to provide that our securities are held subject to the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified by

the NJ Commission pursuant to the NJ Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in the company.  Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that a
holder of our securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is

18

found disqualified under the NJ Act .   In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we may redeem the stock of any holder found to be disqualified.

The ability of a lender to foreclose on pledged assets, including gaming equipment, is subject to compliance with the NJ Act.  Generally, no person is permitted

to hold an ownership interest in or manage a casino or own any gaming assets, including gaming devices, without being licensed.  Consequently, any lender who
desires to enforce a security interest must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either be found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain
interim casino authorization (“ICA”) prior to obtaining any ownership interest.  Similarly, any prospective purchaser of an ownership interest in a casino or of
gaming assets must file the necessary applications for licensure, be investigated, and either found qualified by the NJ Commission or obtain ICA prior to obtaining
any ownership interest or gaming assets.

Massachusetts
Government
Regulation

The Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act (“Massachusetts Act”) subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing and

regulatory requirements.  We are subject to the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated to implement it through our ownership interest in Blue Tarp
reDevelopment, LLC (“Blue Tarp”), which is expected to operate a gaming establishment in Springfield, Massachusetts, which establishment is currently scheduled
for completion and opening in 2017.

Under the Massachusetts Act, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (“Massachusetts Commission”) is responsible for issuing licenses under the

Massachusetts Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons.  The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau
(“IEB”), which is a Bureau within the Massachusetts Commission, is responsible for conducting administrative investigations of applicants and licensees, and for
generally enforcing the Massachusetts Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  In order to enforce the law, the IEB coordinates with the Massachusetts State
Police, Attorney General and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission in order to perform its duties.  The Massachusetts Act also establishes a Gaming
Enforcement Division within the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office responsible for investigating and prosecuting criminal violations of the Massachusetts
Act.  The Massachusetts Commission has the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slot
machines only), within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants.

On December 23, 2013, the Massachusetts Commission determined that Blue Tarp and all applicable principal individuals and entities were qualified, and on
November 6, 2014, the Massachusetts Commission awarded the sole Category 1 license in Region B of Massachusetts to Blue Tarp, effective November 7, 2014.

While a Category 1 license has been awarded to Blue Tarp, Blue Tarp may not conduct gaming activities until an operations certificate has been issued by the

Massachusetts Commission, which will be issued upon compliance with applicable provisions of the Massachusetts Act and regulations promulgated thereunder,
receipt of all required permits and approvals, compliance with the conditions of Blue Tarp’s Category 1 license, and Blue Tarp continuing to meet applicable
licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements.  Under the Massachusetts Act, a Category 1 gaming licensee who fails to commence
operations within one year from the opening date approved by the Massachusetts Commission is subject to the suspension or revocation of its license and, if the
Commission determines that the gaming licensee acted in bad faith in its application, be assessed a fine of $50,000,000 or less.  Under Blue Tarp’s Host Community
Agreement with the City of Springfield, Blue Tarp’s failure to commence operations by February 7, 2018 subjects Blue Tarp to potential liquidated damages in the
amount of $64,393.28 per calendar day. An amendment to the Host Community Agreement negotiated with the City of Springfield to extend this date is pending
before the Springfield City Council.

The initial license term is 15 years, which will commence upon the Massachusetts Commission’s approval of the commencement of the operation of the gaming

establishment.  The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85,000,000, as determined by the Massachusetts Commission and authorized by the Massachusetts
Act, which amount Blue Tarp has paid.  All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licensees are also subject to additional annual fees under the Massachusetts
Act.  Category 1 licensees must generally make on-going annual capital expenditures to their gaming establishments in a minimum aggregate amount equal to 3.5
percent of the net gaming revenues derived from the establishment.

Under the Massachusetts Act, gaming establishments may be open 24 hours a day, patrons must be 21 years of age to wager.  Gaming beverage licenses may be
granted by the Massachusetts Commission for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the gaming establishment except between the hours of 2 a.m.  and 8
a.m..  The Massachusetts Act and regulations also describe procedures for, and restrictions on, check cashing, debit and credit card usage, ATMs, and other
transactions within the gaming establishment.  Certain regulations related to these transactions and other casino internal controls are currently in draft form, and
subject to further review, revision and final approval.

19

The Massachusetts Commission, in particular the IEB, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations and to determine whether applicants for

Category 1 and Category 2 licenses, affiliated holding or intermediary companies, subsidiaries, directors, managers, officers, financiers and debt holders, associates,
key gaming executives and employees, other gaming related employees, and other persons or entities holding a five percent or greater direct or indirect interest in the
applicant, are qualified under the Massachusetts Act (with certain exemptions for institutional investors in the discretion of the Massachusetts Commission) .

After a Category 1 license is awarded, the Massachusetts Commission and IEB have responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee

and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons.  The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category
1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations.  All licenses issued under
the Massachusetts Act are expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee’s fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, and the licensee’s continuing qualification and suitability.  Among other things, the Massachusetts Commission is also responsible for the
collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and
may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee’s records and equipment.

The regulations promulgated to implement the Massachusetts Act impose detailed substantive and procedural requirements related to licensing and on-going

operations.  The regulations include, but are not limited to, provisions concerning: licensing and registration of employees; accounting procedures and internal
controls; surveillance and security requirements; gaming equipment, devices and systems, and device registration and testing; self-exclusion; on-going reporting
requirements related to construction, approvals and operations; temporary licensure; marketing and affirmative marketing plans; notification requirements related to
new or changes in shareholders, executives, and other qualifiers; notification and/or approval of certain material events and transactions; complimentary services; on-
going capital expenditures; political contributions; credit issuance and customer transactions; auditing and record retention; facility design and gaming floor plans;
slot machine possession and transportation; table game rules and procedures; employee credentials; vendors and junkets; and count room and cage procedures.

Generally, interests in a gaming establishment and Category 1 licenses may not be transferred without notification to and approval of the Massachusetts
Commission.  The sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of any security issued by a corporation which holds a gaming license is conditional and will
be ineffective if disapproved by the Massachusetts Commission.  Category 1 licensees may also not change their business governing structure without the
notification and approval of the Massachusetts Commission, and may not operate, invest in or own, in whole or in part, another gaming licensee’s license or gaming
establishment.

The Massachusetts Commission retains the authority to promulgate, amend or repeal regulations concerning the Massachusetts Act, which, if enacted, could

adversely affect the gaming industry and our ability to operate in Massachusetts.  Further, certain regulations are currently in draft form, and subject to further
review, revision and final approval.

NDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’
REPORT

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CityCenter Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, members’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s
Responsibility
for
the
Consolidated
Financial
Statements

Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’
Responsibility

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk  assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  control  relevant  to  the  Company’s  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  significant  accounting  estimates  made  by management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated
financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CityCenter Holdings,
LLC and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2015, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ORGANIZATION

CITYCENTER
HOLDINGS,
LLC
NOTES
TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Organization.
CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the “Company”) is a Delaware limited liability company formed on November 2, 2007. The Company was formed
to acquire, own, develop and operate the CityCenter development (“CityCenter”) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company is a joint venture which is 50%-owned by a
wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts International (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “MGM Resorts”), a Delaware corporation, and 50%-owned by
Infinity World Development Corp (“Infinity World”), which is wholly owned by Dubai World, a Dubai United Arab Emirates government decree entity (each, a
“Member”). The governing document for the Company is the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement dated December 22, 2015 (the
“LLC Agreement”).

Under the LLC Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of six representatives (subject to intermittent vacancies) – three selected by
each Member – and has exclusive power and authority for the overall management of the Company. Compensation for Board of Directors’ duties is borne by the
Members. The Company has no employees and has entered into several agreements with MGM Resorts to provide for the development and day-to-day management
of CityCenter and the Company. See Note 14 for further discussion of such agreements.

Nature
of
Business.
CityCenter is a mixed-use development on the Las Vegas Strip located between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo resorts, both owned by

MGM Resorts. CityCenter consists of the following components:

·

·

Aria  Resort  &  Casino,  a  4,004-room  casino  resort  featuring  an  approximately  140,000  square-foot  casino,  an  approximately  1,800-seat  showroom,
approximately 300,000 square feet of conference and convention space, and numerous world-class restaurants, nightclubs and bars, and pool and spa
amenities;

The Vdara Hotel and Spa, a luxury condominium-hotel with 1,495 units;

· Mandarin  Oriental,  Las  Vegas,  a  392-room  non-gaming  boutique  hotel  managed  by  luxury  hotelier  Mandarin  Oriental  Hotel  Group,  as  well  as  225

luxury residential units (all 225 units were sold and closed as of December 31, 2015);

·

·

The Veer Towers, 669 units in two towers consisting entirely of luxury residential condominium units (668 units sold and closed as of December 31,
2015); and

The Shops at Crystals (“Crystals”) with approximately 355,000 of currently leasable square feet of retail shops, dining, and entertainment venues.

Substantially all of the operations of CityCenter commenced in December 2009, and closing of sales of residential condominium units began in early 2010.

See Note 11 for discussion of the demolition of the Harmon Hotel & Spa (“Harmon”).

NOTE
2
—
BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
AND
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis
of
presentation.
 The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company  does  not  have  a
variable interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.

Management’s
use
of
estimates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
value
measurements.
Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting for and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, residential
real-estate, residential mortgage notes and intangible assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices
in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

5

When assessing fair value of its residential real estate, the Company estimates fair value less costs to sell utilizing Level 3 inputs, including a discounted cash

flow analysis based on management’s current expectations of future cash flows. See Note 4 for further discussion.

The  Company  valued  its  residential  mortgage  notes  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  based  on  Level  3  inputs,  including  contractual  cash  flows  and
discount rates based on market indicators. The Company sold its residential mortgage note portfolio in 2013. See “Residential mortgage notes” below for further
discussion.

Cash
and
cash
equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the

date of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted
cash.
As of December 31, 2014, restricted cash included $58 million in condo proceeds contractually restricted to use for payment on construction
related liens, which were subsequently used to fund amounts due to Perini Building Company (“Perini”) pursuant to the settlement agreements, and $85 million of
restricted  cash related to insurance proceeds received in connection with certain settlement  agreements,  discussed in Note 11. Under the terms of the agreements
applicable to CityCenter, such proceeds were being held in a segregated account and were payable by the Company to MGM Resorts. During 2015 such restrictions
were removed in accordance with these agreements.  See Notes 11 and 13 for further discussion.

Accounts
receivable
and
credit
risk.
 The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  of
December  31,  2015,  approximately  73%  of  the  Company’s  casino  receivables  were  due  from  customers  residing  in  foreign  countries.  Business  or  economic
conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on a specific
review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31,
2015, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed.

Inventories.
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost

is determined primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.

Residential
real
estate.
Residential real estate represents capitalized costs of residential inventory, which consists of completed condominium units available
for  sale  less  impairments  previously  recognized.  Costs  include  land,  direct  and  indirect  construction  and  development  costs,  and  capitalized  property  taxes  and
interest. See Note 4 for further discussion of residential real estate.

As  part  of  an  increase  in  the  Company’s  construction  accrual  during  2013,  the  Company  recognized  an  increased  cost  of  its  residential  inventory  of  $20
million,  $14  million  of  which  was  recorded  to  “Property  transactions,  net”  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2013,  representing  additional  costs  associated  with
previously sold residential units.

Residential  operating  expenses  include  cost  of  real  estate  sold,  holding  costs,  selling  costs,  indirect  selling  costs  and  valuation  allowances  for  residential
mortgage notes receivable. Costs associated with residential sales were deferred during construction, except for indirect selling costs and general and administrative
expense, which were expensed as incurred.

Property
and
equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment
are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life
are charged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements
Land improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Equipment

20 to 40 years
10 to 20 years
3 to 20 years
3 to 20 years

Project costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts)
unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. Final costs of the initial project were determined in connection
with settlement of Perini litigation in December 2014 as discussed in Note 11. The Company recorded non-operating expense related to the Perini settlement of $8
million and $37 million for statutory

6

interest on estimated amounts payable in 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Company accrued $139 million payable to Perini related to the
settlement agreement.

In December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and convention
space.  The  Company  expects  the  majority  of  the  assets  related  to  the  Zarkana  theatre  will  be  disposed  in  April  2016  with  construction  of  the  conference  and
convention  space  to  begin  in  May  2016.    As  a  result,  the  Company  has  shortened  the  useful  life  of  the  assets  related  to  the  Zarkana  theatre  and  recognized  $20
million in accelerated depreciation expense associated with such assets in 2015. Accelerated depreciation expense of $20 million will be recognized each month until
the theatre’s disposition in April 2016.

Impairment
of
long-lived
assets.
The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to be
held and used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the
carrying amount of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the
carrying amount, then impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model.

Intangible
assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The

Company performs its annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. See Note 6 for further discussion.

Debt
issuance
costs
. The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalized
costs are amortized straight-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” (“ASU 2015-03”), in 2015 on a retrospective basis as further
discussed in the “Recently issued accounting standards” section. Accordingly, a reclassification has been made to the prior year financial statements to reclassify $13
million from Deposits and other assets, net, to Long-term debt, net as of December 31, 2014.

Revenue
recognition
and
promotional
allowances.
 Casino  revenue  is  the  aggregate  net  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses,  with  liabilities
recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’ possession (“casino outstanding chip
liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and goods are provided. Advance
deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the customer.

Gaming  revenues  are  recognized  net  of  certain  sales  incentives,  including  discounts  and  points  earned  in  point-loyalty  programs.  The  retail  value  of
accommodations,  food  and  beverage,  and  other  services  furnished  to  guests  without  charge  is  included  in  gross  revenue  and  then  deducted  as  promotional
allowances. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Real
estate
sales
–
revenue
recognition.
Revenue for residential sales is deferred until closing occurs, which is when title, possession and other attributes of
ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the Company is not obligated to perform activities after the sale. Additionally, the buyer’s initial and continuing
investment must be adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay and the buyer’s receivable cannot be subject to future subordination.

Leases
where
the
Company
is
a
lessor.
 The  majority  of  the  Company’s  revenue  from  leasing  activities  relates  to  Crystals.  Minimum  rental  revenue,  if
applicable to the lease, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Revenue from contingent rent is recognized as earned. The Company
provides  construction  allowances  to  certain  tenants.  Construction  allowances  are  recorded  as  fixed  assets  if  the  Company  has  determined  it  is  the  owner  of  such
improvements for accounting purposes; improvements related specifically to the current tenant are depreciated over the shorter of the asset life or lease term.  Where
the Company has determined it is not the owner of such improvements, the construction allowances are amortized over the life of the related lease as a reduction of
revenue.

Loyalty
programs.
Aria participates in the MGM Resorts’ “M life” loyalty program. Customers may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming
play  which  can  be  redeemed  at  restaurants,  box  offices  or  the  M  life  front  desk  at  participating  properties.  Points  may  also  be  redeemed  for  free  slot  play  on
participating machines. The Company records a liability based on the points earned multiplied by the redemption value, less an estimate for points not expected to be
redeemed, and records a corresponding reduction in casino revenue. Customers also earn Express Comps based on their gaming play which can be redeemed for
complimentary  goods  and  services,  including  hotel  rooms,  food  and  beverage,  and  entertainment.  The  Company  records  a  liability  for  the  estimated  costs  of
providing goods and services for Express Comps based on the Express Comps earned multiplied by a cost margin, less an estimate for Express Comps not expected
to be redeemed and records a corresponding expense in the casino department.

Preopening
and
start-up
expenses.
Costs incurred for one-time activities during the start-up phase of operations are accounted for as preopening and start-
up  costs.  Preopening  and  start-up  costs,  including  organizational  costs,  are  expensed  as  incurred.  No  preopening  expenses  were  incurred  for  the  periods  ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014. During 2013, costs classified as preopening and start-up expense represent costs associated with the opening of a new wedding chapel.

Advertising.
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense is included in preopening and start-up
expenses  when  related  to  the  preopening  and  start-up  period  and  in  general  and  administrative  expense  when  related  to  ongoing  operations  or  residential  selling
expenses. Advertising expense was $20 million for the each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Property
transactions,
net.
The Company classifies transactions related to long-lived assets – such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and

gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets – within “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 9 for details.

Residential
mortgage
notes.
Certain buyers of CityCenter’s residential units participated in the Company’s seller financing program, whereby the Company
provided  first  mortgage  financing.  All  mortgage  notes  were  classified  as  held  for  sale  and  reported  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value,  determined  based  on
management’s  assessment  of  the  market  terms  of  the  portfolio  and  its  collectability.  The  evaluation  of  collectability  was  based  on  several  factors  including  past
payment history, duration of the loan, creditworthiness, loan-to-value ratios, underlying collateral, and present economic conditions. The entire residential mortgage
note receivable portfolio was sold in April 2013.

Income
taxes.
 The  Company  is  treated  as  a  partnership  for  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Therefore,  federal  income  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of  the

Members. As a result, no provision for income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive
income
(loss).
Net income (loss) equals comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented.
Dividends.
In April 2015, the Company adopted an annual distribution policy and declared and paid a special dividend of $400 million. Under the annual

distribution policy, the Company will distribute up to 35% of excess cash flow, subject to the approval of the Company’s board of directors.

Recently
issued
accounting
standards.
On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” (“ASU
2016-02”), which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases
as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding
lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize
a straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements
and footnote disclosures.

In  August  2015,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No.  2015-14,  “Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers  (Topic  606):  Deferral  of  the
Effective Date,” which defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers,” (“ASU 2014-09”) to the
fiscal  year,  and interim  periods  within  the year,  beginning  on or  after  December  15, 2017. FASB ASU 2014-09 outlines  a  new, single  comprehensive  model  for
entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. Additionally, the new model will
require  revenue  recognition  to  depict  the  transfer  of  promised  goods  or  services  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  a  company  expects  to
receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements and footnote disclosures.

8

In  July  2015,  the  FASB issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  No. 2015-11,  “Simplifying  the  Measurement  of  Inventory,”  (“ASU 2015-11”),  effective  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out  (FIFO) or average  cost method to be measured  “at the lower of cost and net realizable  value,” thereby simplifying  the current  guidance  under which an
entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures). ASU No. 2015-11 will not apply
to inventories that are measured by using either the LIFO method or the retail inventory method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of
ASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

During 2015, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying  value  of  the  associated  debt  liability,  consistent  with  the  presentation  of  a  debt  discount.  The  amortization  of  such  costs  will  continue  to  be  reported  as
interest  expense.  In addition,  in accordance  with Accounting Standards  Update No. 2015-15, “Presentation  and Subsequent Measurement  of Debt Issuance  Costs
Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements: Amendments to SEC Paragraph Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,” (“ASU 2015-15”),
which  was  adopted  concurrent  with  ASU 2015-03,  the  Company  will  continue  to  present  the  debt  issuance  costs  associated  with  the  Company's  revolving  credit
facilities  as  other  assets  included  within  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  continue  amortizing  those  deferred  costs  over  the  term  of  the  related
facilities.  ASU  2015-03  requires  the  new  guidance  to  be  applied  on  a  retrospective  basis.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2015  and  2014,  the  Company
reclassified $11 million and $13 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Residential real estate was $2 million and $17 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, an additional $7 million
was recorded in property and equipment, net related to a portion of the residential inventory in the rental program. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and  2013,  the  Company  transferred  $7  million,  $43  million,  and  $16  million,  respectively,  of  net  residential  real  estate  assets  from  property  and  equipment,  net
related to a portion of the units that were previously included in the rental program.

The Company is required to carry its residential inventory at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. When assessing impairment of its residential real
estate,  the  Company  estimates  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  utilizing  Level  3  inputs,  including  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  based  on  management’s  current
expectations of future cash flows. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and are highly sensitive to changes in the market and economic conditions.
No impairment charges were recorded against the Company’s residential inventory for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had one unit remaining unsold.

The majority of the Company’s intangible  assets are assets that were contributed by MGM Resorts upon formation  of the Company. Intellectual  property
represents trademarks, domain names, and other intellectual property including the CityCenter,
Aria,
Vdara
and Crystals
tradenames and Aria.com
domain. There is
no contractual or market-based limit to the use of these intangible assets and therefore they have been classified as indefinite-lived.

The  Company  performs  an  annual  review  of  its  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  for  impairment  in  the  fourth  quarter  each  year.  The  asset’s  fair  value  is
compared to its carrying value, and an impairment charge is recorded for any short-fall. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method which discounts
cash flows that would be required to obtain the use of the related intangible asset. Key inputs in the relief-from-royalty analysis include forecasted revenues related
to the intangible asset, market royalty rates, discount rates and terminal year growth rates.

The aircraft time sharing agreement intangible asset relates to an agreement between MGM Resorts and the Company whereby MGM Resorts provides the
Company the use of MGM Resorts’ aircraft in its operations. The Company is charged a rate that is based on Federal Aviation Administration regulations, which
provides for reimbursement for specific costs incurred by MGM Resorts without any profit or mark-up. Accordingly, the fair value of this agreement was recognized
as an intangible asset, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, and will be fully amortized in 2029.

Senior
secured
credit
facility.
At December 31, 2015, the Company’s senior secured credit facility consisted of a $75 million revolving facility maturing in
October 2018, and a $1.5 billion term loan B facility maturing in October 2020. The term loan B facility requires the Company to make amortization payments of
0.25% of the original principal balance at each quarter end. In June 2014 the Company completed a repricing of the term loan B facility and used available cash to
permanently repay $150 million of the term loan B facility, a portion of which represents the amortization obligation through the remaining term of the facility.

The loans under the term loan B bear interest, in the case of Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and in the case of base rate
loans, at the base rate plus 2.25%. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on the term loan B was 4.25%. Loans under the revolving facility bear interest, in the
case of Eurodollar loans, at LIBOR plus 3.75% or 4.00%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, and in the case of base rate loans, 2.75% or 3.00%, depending
on the Company’s ratings. Additionally, the Company pays an applicable fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on the Company’s credit ratings, for the unused portion
of the revolving facility. The Company had $63 million of available borrowing capacity under its senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2015.

11

In connection with the closing of the senior secured credit facility in October 2013, the Company redeemed its existing 7.625% senior secured first lien notes
and  10.75%  senior  secured  second  lien  PIK  toggle  notes  at  a  premium  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  indentures  governing  those  notes.  As  a  result  of  the
transaction, the Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term debt of $140 million, primarily consisting of premiums associated with the redemption of the
existing first and second lien notes as well as the write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs. In connection with the October 2013 debt restructuring,
sponsor notes with a carrying value of approximately $738 million were converted to Members’ equity. As a result of these transactions, the senior secured credit
facility is CityCenter’s only remaining long-term debt.

The  senior  secured  credit  facility  is  a  general  senior  obligation  of  the  Company  and  ranks  equally  with  the  Company’s  other  existing  and  future  senior
obligations,  is  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  on  a  senior  secured  basis  by  the  restricted  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  and  is  secured  by  a  first-priority
perfected lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets and the assets of its subsidiaries.

The  senior  secured  credit  facility  contains  covenants  that,  among  other  things,  restrict  the  Company’s  ability  to  (i)  incur  additional  indebtedness  or  liens,
(ii) pay dividends or make distributions on its equity interests or repurchase its equity interests, (iii) make certain investments, (iv) enter into certain burdensome
agreements limiting the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to it, (v) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, and
(vi) enter into certain transactions with its equity holders and affiliates. In addition, the senior secured credit facility includes certain financial covenants that require
the Company to maintain a quarterly minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0:1.0 and a maximum quarterly leverage ratio for the trailing four quarters of: 6.75:1.00
for  December  31,  2015;  6.00:1.00  for  March  31,  2016  through  December  31,  2016;  and  5.50:1.00  for  March  31,  2017  and  thereafter.    The  Company  was  in
compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2015.

Pursuant to the senior secured credit facility, the Company is required to make permanent repayments of principal based on an annual calculation of excess
cash flow, as defined in the agreements. The percentage of excess cash flow required to be repaid is based on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the fiscal
year, with 50% required to be repaid if the leverage ratio is greater than 5.0:1.0 as of the measurement date, 25% if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0:1.0
and  greater  than  4.0:1.0,  and  no  payment  of  excess  cash  flow  is  required  if  the  leverage  ratio  is  less  than  or  equal  to  4.0:1.0.  As  of  December  31,  2015,  the
Company’s excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior secured credit agreement for 2015 was $43 million. During 2015 the Company paid
$38 million related to its 2015 excess cash flow obligation and recorded $5 million in current portion of long-term debt related to its remaining obligation. As of
December 31, 2014, the Company’s excess cash flow required to be paid in accordance with the senior secured credit agreement for 2014 was included in the $150
million principal repayments. As a result, the Company did not record a current portion of long-term debt related to a 2014 obligation of excess cash flow repayment.

Fair
value
of
long-term
debt.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.50 billion

and $1.61 billion, respectively, and was determined using estimates based on trading prices of similar liabilities, a Level 2 input.

Maturities
of
long-term
debt.
As of December 31, 2015, maturities of the Company’s long-term debt were as follows:

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The Company determines its segments based on the nature of the products and services provided. There are six operating segments: Aria, Vdara, Mandarin
Oriental hotel, Crystals, Mandarin Oriental residential and Veer residential. Mandarin Oriental has both a hotel and a residential operating segment. The Company
has aggregated residential operations into one reportable segment (“Residential”) given the similar economic characteristics and business of selling and leasing high-
rise condominiums. All other operating segments are reported separately. The Company’s operating segments do not include the ongoing activity associated with
closing out its construction costs and certain corporate administrative costs.

The Company analyzes the results of its operating segments’ operations based on Adjusted EBITDA, which it defines as earnings before interest and other
non-operating  income  (expense),  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization,  preopening  and  start-up  expenses,  and  property  transactions,  net.  The  Company  believes
Adjusted EBITDA is 1) a widely used measure of operating performance in the hospitality and gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of hospitality
and gaming companies.

While  items  excluded  from  Adjusted  EBITDA  may  be  recurring  in  nature  and  should  not  be  disregarded  in  evaluating  the  Company’s  or  its  segments’
earnings  performance,  it  is  useful  to  exclude  such  items  when  analyzing  current  results  and  trends  compared  to  other  periods  because  these  items  can  vary
significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, the Company believes
excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, write-downs and impairments includes normal
recurring  disposals  and  gains  and  losses  on  sales  of  assets  related  to  specific  assets  within  CityCenter,  but  also  includes  impairment  charges  which  may  not  be
comparable period over period.

COMMITMENTS
AND
CONTINGENCIES

Construction
litigation.
In March 2010, Perini, general contractor for CityCenter, filed a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, State
of Nevada, against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts which was the original party to the Perini construction agreement)
and certain direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Perini asserted, among other things, that CityCenter was substantially completed, but the defendants failed
to pay Perini approximately $490 million allegedly due and owing under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and materials expended on CityCenter.

In April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case which joined as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential condominium units (the
“Condo  Owner  Defendants”),  added  a  count  for  foreclosure  of  Perini's  recorded  master  mechanic’s  lien  against  the  CityCenter  property  in  the  amount  of
approximately $491 million, and asserted the priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the Company, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Company’s
lenders in the CityCenter property.  In November 2012, Perini filed a second amended complaint which, among other things, added claims against the CityCenter
defendants of breach of contract (alleging that CityCenter’s Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) failed to provide adequate project insurance for Perini
with broad coverages and high limits), and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (alleging improper administration by the Company
of  the  OCIP  and  Builders  Risk  insurance  programs).  Prior  to  the  Final  Settlement,  as  defined  below,  the  Company  settled  the  claims  of  219  first-tier  Perini
subcontractors (including the claims of any lower-tier subcontractors that might have claims through those first-tier subcontractors). As a result of these settlement
agreements  and  the  prior  settlement  agreements  between  Perini  and  the  Company,  most  but  not  all  of  the  components  of  Perini’s  non-Harmon-related  lien  claim
against the Company were resolved. On February 24, 2014, Perini filed a revised lien for $174 million as the amount claimed by Perini and the remaining Harmon-
related subcontractors.

During 2013, the Company reached a settlement agreement with certain professional service providers against whom it had asserted claims in this litigation
for errors or omissions with respect to the CityCenter project, and relevant insurers.  This settlement was approved by the court and the Company received proceeds
of $38 million in 2014 related to both the Harmon and other components of the CityCenter project.

In 2014, the Company reached a settlement with builder’s risk insurers of a claim relating to damage alleged at the Harmon and received proceeds of $55

million.

In December 2014, the Perini matter was  concluded through a global settlement among the Company, MGM Resorts, Perini, the remaining subcontractors,
including those implicated in the Harmon work (and their affiliates), and relevant insurers, which followed the previously disclosed settlement agreements and an
extra-judicial  program  for  settlement  of  certain  project  subcontractor  claims.  This  global  settlement  concluded  all  outstanding  claims  in  the  case  (the  “Final
Settlement”). The effectiveness of the global settlement was made contingent upon the Company’s execution of certain indemnity and release agreements (which
were executed  in January  2015) and the Company’s procurement  of replacement  general  liability  insurance  covering construction  of the CityCenter development
(which was obtained in January 2015).

The Final Settlement, together with previous settlement agreements relating to the non-Harmon related lien claims,  resolved all of Perini’s and the remaining
subcontractors’ lien claims against the Company and MGM Resorts, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, MGM Resorts International Design (formerly known as
MGM MIRAGE Design Group), and the Condo Owner Defendants. However, the Company expressly  reserved  any claims  for latent  or hidden defects  as to any
portion of CityCenter’s original construction (other than the Harmon) not known to the Company at the time of the agreement.  The Company and MGM Resorts
entered into the Final Settlement solely as a compromise and settlement and not in any way as an admission of liability or fault.

The key terms of the Final Settlement included:

With  respect  to  its  non-Harmon  lien  claims,  Perini  waived  a  specific  portion  of  its  lien  claim  against  the  Company,  which  combined  with  the  prior  non-
Harmon agreement and accrued interest resulted in a total payment to Perini of $153 million, approximately $14 million of which was paid in December 2014. The
total payment to Perini was funded by MGM Resorts under their completion guarantee and included the application of approximately $58 million of condominium
proceeds that were previously held in escrow by the Company to fund construction lien claims upon final resolution of the Perini litigation.

The  Company’s recovery  for  its  Harmon  construction  defect  claims,  when added  to the  Harmon-related  proceeds  from  prior  insurance  settlements  of  $85
million, resulted in gross cash settlement proceeds to the Company of approximately $191 million (of which approximately $18 million was paid by MGM Resorts
to CityCenter under the completion guarantee in February 2015).

15

In conjunction with the Final Settlement, MGM Resorts and an insurer participating in the OCIP resolved their arbitration dispute concerning such insurers
claim for payments it made under the OCIP general liability coverage for contractor costs incurred in the Harmon litigation, premium adjustments and certain other
costs and expenses. MGM Resorts settled this dispute for $38 million, and funded the majority of such amounts under the completion guarantee in January 2015.

Harmon.
As discussed above, a global settlement was reached in the Perini litigation in December 2014, which finally resolved all outstanding liens, claims
and counterclaims between the Company and MGM Resorts on one hand, and Perini, the remaining subcontractors and remaining insurers on the other hand. Among
the  matters  resolved  were  the  Company’s  claims  against  Perini  and  other  contractors  and  subcontractors  with  respect  to  construction  at  the  Harmon.  Pursuant  to
leave  of  court  in  2014,  the  Company  commenced  demolition  of  the  building.  The  Company  has  completed  a  partial  demolition  of  the  building  and  is  currently
evaluating options for further demolition and plans for the future use of the remaining structure. The Company believes the remaining demolition of the Harmon
structure if demolished to the ground level would cost approximately $15 million.

Other
litigation.
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings that relate to construction and development matters and operational matters incidental
to  its  business.  Management  does  not  believe  that  the  outcome  of  such  proceedings  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company’s  consolidated  financial
statements. The Company maintained an OCIP during the construction and development process. Under the OCIP, certain insurance coverages may cover a portion
of the Company’s general liability, workers compensation, and other potential liabilities.

Other
commitments.
The Company entered into an agreement with a service provider for the initial and ongoing leasing of Crystals. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company was required to pay an annual service fee of approximately $2 million in 2011, increasing 3% each year through the initial term of the
agreement, which expires in 2019. In addition to the service fee, the Company will be required to pay approximately $11 million at the termination of the agreement
in 2019, which is being recorded ratably over the contract term. As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $8 million related to such amount within “Other
long-term obligations” in the consolidated balance sheet. Additional fees may be incurred if the service provider exercises its option to renew the agreement in 2019.

Other
guarantees.
The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit
issued by financial institutions. The Company’s available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.
At December 31, 2015, the Company had $12 million in letters of credit outstanding.

Leases
where
the
Company
is
a
lessee.
 The  Company  is  party  to  various  leases  for  real  estate  and  equipment  under  operating  lease  arrangements.  The

Company’s future minimum obligations under non-cancelable leases are immaterial in each of the next five years, and in total.

Leases
where
the
Company
is
a
lessor.
The Company enters into operating leases related to retail, dining and entertainment venues primarily at Crystals. As
of  December  31,  2015,  the  Company  has  62  such  leases  in  place.  Tenants  are  primarily  responsible  for  tenant  improvements,  though  the  Company  provides
construction allowances to certain lessees. Leases include base rent, common area maintenance charges and, in some cases, percentage rent based on the sales of the
lessee.

Expected fixed future minimum lease payments for leases in place as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:

$13 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Residential
leases.
In  October  of  2010,  the  Company  began  a  program  to  lease  a  portion  of  unsold  residential  condominium  units  at  Veer  and  Mandarin
Oriental  with  minimum  lease  terms  of  one  year.  For  the  years  ended  December  31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 revenue  from  the  real  estate  leasing  program  was $0.1
million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, and was recorded within “Residential” revenue.

CONTRIBUTIONS
AND
DISTRIBUTIONS
TO
MEMBERS

In connection with the restated senior credit facility, MGM Resorts entered into a restated completion guarantee (as restated, the “completion guarantee”) that
supported  the  remaining  construction  payables  from  the  construction  of  CityCenter.  The  terms  of  the  completion  guarantee  required  the  Company  to  use  $124
million  of  subsequent  net  residential  sale  proceeds  to  fund  construction  costs,  or  to  reimburse  MGM  Resorts  for  construction  costs  previously  expended.  As  of
December  31, 2014, the Company had received  net residential  proceeds  in excess  of the $124 million  and was holding $58 million  in a condo proceeds  account
representing the remaining proceeds available to fund completion guarantee obligations or be reimbursed to MGM Resorts. The $58 million in condo proceeds was
recorded  within  “Restricted  cash”  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  was  subsequently  used  to  fund  amounts  due  to  Perini  pursuant  to  the
settlement agreements under the Perini lawsuit. See Note 11 for further discussion of the Perini lawsuit. The completion guarantee was terminated in June 2015 and
as of December 31, 2015, MGM Resorts had funded $888 million under the completion guarantee which the Company recorded as equity contributions.

In April 2015, the Company adopted an annual distribution policy and declared and paid a special dividend of $400 million. Under the annual distribution

policy, the Company will distribute up to 35% of excess cash flow, subject to the approval of the Company’s board of directors.
