ITEM 1. BUSINESS

PART I

PG&E Corporation, incorporated in California in 1995, is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public
utility operating in northern and central California. The Utility was incorporated in California in 1905. PG&E Corporation became the holding company of the
Utility and its subsidiaries in 1997. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating revenues, income, and total assets can be found below in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The principal executive offices of PG&E Corporation and the Utility are located at 77 Beale Street, P.O. Box 770000, San Francisco, California 94177. PG&E
Corporation’s telephone number is (415) 973-1000 and the Utility’s telephone number is (415) 973-7000.

At December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility had approximately 24,000 regular employees, approximately 13 of which were employees of PG&E
Corporation. Of the Utility’s regular employees, approximately 14,500 are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the local chapters of three labor
unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Engineers and Scientists of California; and the Service Employees International Union. The
collective bargaining agreements currently in effect will expire on December 31, 2021.

This is a combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for PG&E Corporation and the Utility. Each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is a separate entity, with
distinct creditors and claimants, and is subject to separate laws, rules, and regulations. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements, are available free of charge on both PG&E Corporation's website,
www.pgecorp.com
, and the Utility's website, www.pge.com
, as promptly as practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Additionally, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility routinely provide links to the Utility’s principal regulatory proceedings before the CPUC and the FERC at http://investor.pgecorp.com
,
under the “Regulatory Filings” tab, so that such filings are available to investors upon filing with the relevant agency. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also
routinely post or provide direct links to presentations, documents, and other information that may be of interest to investors at http://investor.pgecorp.com
, under
the “News & Events: Events & Presentations” tab and links to certain documents and information related to the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California
wildfires, and the 2015 Butte fire which may be of interest to investors, at http://investor.pgecorp.com
, under the “Wildfire Updates” tab, in order to publicly
disseminate such information. It is possible that any of these filings or information included therein could be deemed to be material information. The information
contained on this website is not part of this or any other report that PG&E Corporation or the Utility files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility are providing the address to this website solely for the information of investors and do not intend the address to be an active link.

In 2018 and 2017, Northern California experienced major wildfires. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see
Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Item 7. MD&A, and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

This 2018 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risks
that could affect the outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7. MD&A.

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed for Chapter 11 protection. For more information about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings see Item 7.
MD&A and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to the wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. Management
has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns, and their
independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report which states certain conditions exist which raise
substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. For more information about these
matters, see Item 7. MD&A and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Regulatory Environment

The Utility's business is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels. At the state level, the Utility is regulated
primarily by the CPUC. At the federal level, the Utility is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC and the NRC. The Utility is also subject to the requirements of
other federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including with respect to safety, the environment, and health. This section and the “Ratemaking Mechanisms”
section below summarize some of the more significant laws, regulations, and regulatory proceedings affecting the Utility.

PG&E Corporation is a “public utility holding company” as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and is subject to regulatory oversight
by the FERC. PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries are exempt from all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 other than the
obligation to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes.

The California Public Utilities Commission

The CPUC is a regulatory agency that regulates privately owned public utilities in California. The CPUC has jurisdiction over the rates and terms and conditions of
service for the Utility's electric and natural gas distribution operations, electric generation, and natural gas transmission and storage services. The CPUC also has
exercised jurisdiction over the Utility's issuances of securities, dispositions of utility assets and facilities, energy purchases on behalf of the Utility's electric and
natural gas retail customers, rates of return, rates of depreciation, oversight of nuclear decommissioning, and aspects of the siting of facilities used in providing
electric and natural gas utility service.

The CPUC enforces state laws and regulations that set forth safety requirements pertaining to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of utility
gas and electric facilities.  The CPUC can impose penalties of up to $50,000 per day, per violation, for violations that occurred after January 1, 2012. (The statutory
maximum penalty for violations that occurred before January 1, 2012 is $20,000 per violation.) The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of
penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number
of persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC also is required to
consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged.

The CPUC has delegated authority to the SED to issue citations and impose penalties for violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports. Under
the current gas and electric citation programs adopted by the CPUC in September 2016, the SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if
it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation
issued. Effective January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty increased to $100,000. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on
less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day. The SED has the discretion to either address each violation in a distinct citation or to
include multiple violations in a single citation regardless of whether the violations occurred in the same incident or are of a similar nature. Penalty payments for
citations issued pursuant to the gas and electric safety citation programs are the responsibility of shareholders of an issuer and must not be recovered in rates or
otherwise directly or indirectly charged to customers.

The California State Legislature also directs the CPUC to implement state laws and policies, such as the laws relating to wildfires and wildfire cost recovery,
increasing renewable energy resources, the development and widespread deployment of distributed generation and self-generation resources, the reduction of GHG
emissions, the establishment of energy storage procurement targets, and the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The CPUC is
responsible for approving funding and administration of state-mandated public purpose programs such as energy efficiency and other customer programs. The
CPUC also conducts audits and reviews of the Utility’s accounting, performance, and compliance with regulatory guidelines.

The CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between the Utility and PG&E Corporation and other affiliates, including financial
conditions that require PG&E Corporation’s Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and
prudent to meet the Utility's obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial
Resources” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California Independent System Operator

The FERC has jurisdiction over the Utility's electric transmission revenue requirements and rates, the licensing of substantially all of the Utility's hydroelectric
generation facilities, and the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC regulates the interconnections of the Utility’s transmission systems with
other electric system and generation facilities, the tariffs and conditions of service of regional transmission organizations and the terms and rates of wholesale
electricity sales. The FERC also is charged with adopting and enforcing mandatory standards governing the reliability of the nation’s electric transmission grid,
including standards to protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The FERC has authority to
impose fines of up to $1 million per day for violations of certain federal statutes and regulations.

The CAISO is the FERC-approved regional transmission organization for the Utility’s service territory. The CAISO controls the operation of the electric
transmission system in California and provides open access transmission service on a non-discriminatory basis. The CAISO also is responsible for planning
transmission system additions, ensuring the maintenance of adequate reserves of generating capacity, and ensuring that the reliability of the transmission system is
maintained.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, including the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo
Canyon and the Utility’s retired nuclear generating unit at Humboldt Bay. (See “Electricity Resources” below.) NRC regulations require extensive monitoring and
review of the safety, radiological, seismic, environmental, and security aspects of these facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to
impose fines or to force a shutdown of a nuclear plant, or both. NRC safety and security requirements have, in the past, necessitated substantial capital
expenditures at Diablo Canyon, and substantial capital expenditures could be required in the future. (For more information about Diablo Canyon, see “Regulatory
Matters - Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 7. MD&A and Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)

Third-party monitor

On April 12, 2017, the Utility retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense as part of its compliance with the sentencing terms of the Utility’s January 27,
2017 federal criminal conviction, which sentenced the Utility to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor
for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years.  The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes
reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations and maintains effective ethics, compliance, and safety related incentive
programs on a Utility-wide basis. (For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors and "U.S. District Court Matters and Probation" in Item 3. Legal Proceedings
and in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Other Regulators

The CEC is the state's primary energy policy and planning agency. The CEC is responsible for licensing all thermal power plants over 50 MW within California.
The CEC also is responsible for forecasts of future energy needs used by the CPUC in determining the adequacy of the utilities' electricity procurement plans and
for adopting building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.

The CARB is the state agency responsible for setting and monitoring GHG and other emission limits. The CARB is also responsible for adopting and enforcing
regulations to implement state law requirements to gradually reduce GHG emissions in California. (See “Environmental Regulation - Air Quality and Climate
Change” below.)

In addition, the Utility obtains permits, authorizations, and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of the Utility's generation facilities,
electricity transmission lines, natural gas transportation pipelines, and gas compressor station facilities. The Utility also periodically obtains permits,
authorizations, and licenses in connection with distribution of electricity and natural gas that grant the Utility rights to occupy and/or use public property for the
operation of the Utility's business and to conduct certain related operations. The Utility has franchise agreements with approximately 300 cities and counties that
permit the Utility to install, operate, and maintain the Utility's electric and natural gas facilities in the public streets and highways. In exchange for the right to use
public streets and highways, the Utility pays annual fees to the cities and counties. In most cases, the Utility’s franchise agreements are for an indeterminate term,
with no expiration date. (For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

10

Ratemaking Mechanisms

The Utility’s rates for electric and natural gas utility services are set at levels that are intended to allow the Utility to recover its costs of providing service and a
return on invested capital (“cost-of-service ratemaking”). Before setting rates, the CPUC and the FERC conduct proceedings to determine the annual amount that
the Utility will be authorized to collect from its customers (“revenue requirements”). The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to
enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administration and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation, tax,
and financing expenses). In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to “pass-through” to customers
(referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A), including its costs to procure electricity, natural gas and nuclear fuel,
to administer public purpose and customer programs, and to decommission its nuclear facilities.

The Utility’s rate of return on electric transmission assets is determined in the FERC TO proceedings. Similarly, the authorized rate of return on all other Utility
assets is set in the CPUC’s cost of capital proceeding. Other than its electric transmission and certain gas transmission and storage revenues, the Utility’s base
revenues are “decoupled” from its sales volume. Regulatory balancing accounts, or revenue adjustment mechanisms, are designed to allow the Utility to fully
collect its authorized base revenue requirements. As a result, the Utility’s base revenues are not impacted by fluctuations in sales resulting from, for example,
weather or economic conditions. The Utility’s earnings primarily depend on its ability to manage its base operating and capital costs (referred to as “Utility
Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Item 7. MD&A) within its authorized base revenue requirements.

Due to the seasonal nature of the Utility’s business and rate design, customer electric bills are generally higher during summer months (May - October) because of
higher demand, driven by air conditioning loads.  Customer bills related to gas service generally increase during the winter months (November - March) to account
for the gas peak due to heating.

From time to time, the CPUC may use incentive ratemaking mechanisms that provide the Utility an opportunity to earn some additional revenues. For example, the
Utility has earned incentives for the successful implementation of energy efficiency programs.

See “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC proceedings.

Base Revenues

General
Rate
Cases

The GRC is the primary proceeding in which the CPUC determines the amount of base revenue requirements that the Utility is authorized to collect from
customers to recover the Utility’s anticipated costs, including return on rate base, related to its electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and Utility-owned
electric generation operations. The CPUC generally conducts a GRC every three or four years. The CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first
year (or “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC
period (known as “attrition years”). Attrition year rate adjustments are generally provided for cost increases related to increases in invested capital and inflation.
Parties in the Utility's GRC include the PAO and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as a myriad of other
intervenors who represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests. (For more information about the Utility’s GRC, see
“Regulatory Matters 2017 General Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters 2020 General Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Natural
Gas
Transmission
and
Storage
Rate
Cases

The CPUC determines the Utility’s authorized revenue requirements and rates for its natural gas transmission and storage services in the GT&S rate case.  The
CPUC generally conducts a GT&S rate case every three or four years.  Similar to the GRC, the CPUC approves the annual revenue requirements for the first year
(or “test year”) of the GT&S rate case period and typically determines annual increases in revenue requirements for attrition years of the GT&S rate case period.
 Parties in the Utility's GT&S rate case include the PAO and TURN, who generally represent the overall interests of residential customers, as well as other
intervenors who represent other business, community, customer, environmental, and union interests. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - 2015 Gas
Transmission and Storage Rate Case” and “Regulatory Matters - 2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” in Item 7. MD&A.)

11

Cost
of
Capital
Proceedings

The CPUC periodically conducts a cost of capital proceeding to authorize the Utility's capital structure and rates of return for its electric generation, electric and
natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base. The CPUC has authorized the Utility’s capital structure through 2019, consisting of
52% common equity, 47% long-term debt, and 1% preferred stock. The CPUC also set the authorized ROE through 2017 at 10.40% and 10.25% beginning on
January 1, 2018 and reset the cost of debt to 4.89%. The CPUC previously adopted an adjustment mechanism to allow the Utility’s capital structure and ROE to be
adjusted if the utility bond index changes by certain thresholds on an annual basis. The Utility expects to submit its next cost of capital application to the CPUC on
or about April 22, 2019.

Electricity
Transmission
Owner
Rate
Cases

The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case. The Utility has historically filed a TO rate case every year. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the
requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before the FERC has issued a final decision. In 2018, the Utility filed a proposed formula rate at FERC, which
would be updated annually according to the formula. These FERC-approved rates are included by the CPUC in the Utility's retail electric rates and by the CAISO
in its Transmission Access Charges to wholesale customers. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters -Transmission Owner Rate Cases” in Item 7.
MD&A.) The Utility also recovers a portion of its revenue requirements for its wholesale electric transmission costs through charges collected under specific
contracts with wholesale transmission customers that the Utility entered into before the CAISO began its operations. These wholesale customers are charged
individualized rates based on the terms of their contracts.

Memorandum
Account
Costs

Periodically, costs arise which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or
extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize
recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred. These accounts, which include the CEMA,
WEMA, and FHPMA, among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire
prevention-related costs. While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through a
GRC. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account”, “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Expense Memorandum
Account”, and “Regulatory Matters - Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Revenues to Recover Energy Procurement and Other Pass-Through Costs

Electricity
Procurement
Costs

California investor-owned electric utilities are responsible for procuring electrical capacity required to meet bundled customer demand, plus applicable reserve
margins, that are not satisfied from their own generation facilities and existing electric contracts. The utilities are responsible for scheduling and bidding electric
generation resources, including certain electricity procured from third parties into the wholesale market, to meet customer demand according to which resources
are the least expensive (i.e., using the principles of “least-cost dispatch”). In addition, the utilities are required to obtain CPUC approval of their BCPPs based on
long-term demand forecasts. In October 2015, the CPUC approved the Utility’s most recent BCPP. It was revised since its initial approval and will remain in effect
as revised until superseded by a subsequent CPUC-approved plan. On February 8, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s filing that suspended certain elements of
its current BCPP as a result of its financial condition, effective as of January 16, 2019.  Additionally, on January 25, 2019, the Utility filed with the CPUC an
update to its BCPP to further refine how it manages certain elements of its procurement activity and provide detail of its sales framework.  The updated BCPP
would be effective upon CPUC approval.

California law allows electric utilities to recover the costs incurred in compliance with their CPUC-approved BCPPs without further after-the-fact reasonableness
review by the CPUC. The CPUC may disallow costs associated with electricity purchases if the costs were not incurred in compliance with the CPUC-approved
plan or if the CPUC determines that the utility failed to follow the principles of least-cost dispatch. Additionally, the CPUC may disallow the cost of replacement
power procured due to unplanned outages at Utility-owned generation facilities.

12

The Utility recovers its electric procurement costs annually primarily through the energy resource recovery account. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.) Each year, the CPUC reviews the Utility’s forecasted procurement costs related to power purchase agreements, derivative
instruments, GHG emissions costs, and generation fuel expense, and approves a forecasted revenue requirement. The CPUC may adjust the Utility’s retail electric
rates more frequently if the forecasted aggregate over-collections or under-collections in the energy resource recovery account exceed 5% of its prior year electric
procurement and Utility-owned generation revenues. The CPUC performs an annual compliance review of the transactions recorded in the energy resource
recovery account.

The CPUC has approved various power purchase agreements that the Utility has entered into with third parties in accordance with the Utility’s CPUC-approved
procurement plan, to meet mandatory renewable energy targets, and to comply with resource adequacy requirements. (For more information, see “Electric Utility
Operations - Electricity Resources” below as well as Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Natural
Gas
Procurement,
Storage,
and
Transportation
Costs

The Utility recovers the cost of gas used in generation facilities as a cost of electricity that is recovered annually through retail electric rates.

The Utility sets the natural gas procurement rate for small commercial and residential customers (referred to as “core” customers) monthly, based on the forecasted
costs of natural gas, core pipeline capacity and storage costs. The Utility recovers the cost of gas purchased on behalf of core customers as well as the cost of
derivative instruments for its core gas portfolio, through its retail gas rates, subject to limits as set forth in its core procurement incentive mechanism described
below. The Utility reflects the difference between actual natural gas purchase costs and forecasted natural gas purchase costs in several natural gas balancing
accounts, with under-collections and over-collections taken into account in subsequent monthly rate changes.

The core procurement incentive mechanism protects the Utility against after-the-fact reasonableness reviews of its gas procurement costs for its core gas portfolio.
Under the core procurement incentive mechanism, the Utility’s natural gas purchase costs for a fixed 12-month period are compared to an aggregate market-based
benchmark based on a weighted average of published monthly and daily natural gas price indices at the points where the Utility typically purchases natural gas.
Costs that fall within a tolerance band, which is 99% to 102% of the commodity benchmark, are considered reasonable and are fully recovered in customers’ rates.
One-half of the costs above 102% of the benchmark are recoverable in customers’ rates, and the Utility's customers receive in their rates 80% of any savings
resulting from the Utility’s cost of natural gas that is less than 99% of the benchmark. The Utility retains the remaining amount of these savings as incentive
revenues, subject to a cap equal to 1.5% of total natural gas commodity costs. While this mechanism remains in place, changes in the price of natural gas,
consistent with the market-based benchmark, are not expected to materially impact net income.

The Utility incurs transportation costs under various agreements with interstate and Canadian third-party transportation service providers. These providers transport
natural gas from the points at which the Utility takes delivery of natural gas (typically in Canada, the U.S. Rocky Mountains, and the southwestern United States)
to the points at which the Utility's natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements are governed by FERC-approved tariffs that detail rates, rules, and
terms of service for the provision of natural gas transportation services to the Utility on interstate and Canadian pipelines. The FERC approves the United States
tariffs that shippers, including the Utility, pay for pipeline service, and the applicable Canadian tariffs are approved by the National Energy Board, a Canadian
regulatory agency. The transportation costs the Utility incurs under these agreements are recovered through CPUC-approved rates as core natural gas procurement
costs or as a cost of electricity.

13

Costs
Associated
with
Public
Purpose
and
Customer
Programs

The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover the costs of various public purpose and other customer programs through the collection of rates from most Utility
customers.  These programs relate to energy efficiency, demand response, distributed generation, energy research and development, and other matters.
 Additionally, the CPUC has authorized the Utility to provide discounted rates for specified types of customers, such as for low-income customers under the
California Alternate Rates for Energy (“CARE”) program, which is paid for by the Utility’s other customers.

Nuclear
Decommissioning
Costs

The Utility's nuclear power facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and the retired facility at Humboldt Bay. Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe
removal of nuclear facilities from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the
property for unrestricted use. Nuclear decommissioning costs are generally collected in advance through rates and are held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be
used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. The Utility files an application with the CPUC every three years requesting approval of the Utility’s
updated estimated decommissioning costs and any rate change necessary to fully fund the nuclear decommissioning trusts to the levels needed to decommission the
Utility’s nuclear plants.

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units by 2024 and 2025. The CPUC:

•

•

•

•

•

•

deferred consideration of replacement resources to the CPUC’s Integrated Resource Planning proceeding;

authorized rate recovery for up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retention program;

authorized rate recovery for an employee retraining program of $11.3 million requested by the Utility;

rejected rate recovery of the proposed $85 million for the community impacts mitigation program on the grounds that rate recovery for such a program
requires legislative authorization;

authorized rate recovery of $18.6 million of the total Diablo Canyon license renewal cost of $53 million and rate recovery of canceled project costs equal
to 100% of direct costs incurred prior to June 30, 2016, and 25% of direct costs incurred after June 30, 2016, based on a provision of the settlement
agreement among the Utility, the Joint Parties, and certain other parties that the Utility filed with the CPUC in May 2017; and

approved the amortization of the book value for Diablo Canyon consistent with the Diablo Canyon closure schedule.

On March 7, 2018, the Utility submitted a request to the NRC to withdraw its Diablo Canyon license renewal application. On April 16, 2018, the NRC granted the
Utility’s request to withdraw its license renewal application.

On November 29, 2018, in response to SB 1090, the CPUC issued its decision addressing the key remaining goals of the Diablo Canyon joint proposal agreement,
including:

•

•

•

approving the community impact mitigation settlement of $85 million, originally proposed in the joint settlement agreement;

deferring implementation to its Integrated Resource Planning to ensure that there is no increase in GHG emissions as a result of the Diablo Canyon
retirement; and

approving full funding of the $352.1 million Diablo Canyon employee retention program, originally proposed in the joint settlement agreement.

On February 8, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility's request to implement SB 1090, effective as of January 1, 2019, which includes full funding for the
community impact mitigation program and employee retention program.

For costs related to Asset Retirement Obligations see "Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation" in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
item 8.

Electric Utility Operations

The Utility generates electricity and provides electric transmission and distribution services throughout its service territory in northern and central California to
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers. The Utility provides “bundled” services (i.e., electricity, transmission and distribution services) to
customers in its service territory. Customers also can obtain electricity from alternative providers such as municipalities or CCAs, as well as from self-generation
resources, such as rooftop solar installations. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Electricity Resources

The Utility is required to maintain capacity adequate to meet its customers’ demand for electricity (“load”), including peak demand and planning and operating
reserves, deliverable to the locations and at times as may be necessary to provide reliable electric service. The Utility is required to dispatch, or schedule all of the
electric resources within its portfolio using least-cost dispatch .

The following table shows the percentage of the Utility’s total deliveries of electricity to customers in 2018 represented by each major electric resource, and further
discussed below.

Renewable
Energy
Resources

California law established an RPS that requires load-serving entities, such as the Utility, to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they deliver to their
customers. In October 2015, the California Governor signed SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015 into law. SB 350 became effective
January 1, 2016, and increases the amount of renewable energy that must be delivered by most load-serving entities, including the Utility, to their customers from
33% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2017-2020 compliance period, to 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of the 2028- 2030
compliance period, and in each three-year compliance period thereafter, unless changed by legislative action. SB 350 provides compliance flexibility and waiver
mechanisms, including increased flexibility to apply excess renewable energy procurement in one compliance period to future compliance periods. In September
2018, the California Governor signed SB 100 into law, increasing from 50% to 60% of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030;
and established state policy that 100 percent of all retail electricity sales must come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. The Utility may incur
additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the new renewable energy targets, which the Utility expects will continue to be recoverable from customers as
“pass-through” costs. The Utility also may be subject to penalties for failure to meet the higher targets. The CPUC is required to open a new rulemaking
proceeding to adopt regulations to implement the higher renewable targets.

Renewable generation resources, for purposes of the RPS requirements, include bioenergy such as biogas and biomass, certain hydroelectric facilities (30 MW or
less), wind, solar, and geothermal energy. During 2018 , 38.9% of the Utility’s energy deliveries were from renewable energy sources, exceeding the annual RPS
target of 28% . Approximately 36% of the renewable energy delivered to the Utility’s customers was purchased from non-QF third parties. Additional renewable
resources were provided by QFs ( 0.5% ), the Utility’s small hydroelectric facilities ( 1.5% ), and the Utility’s solar facilities ( 0.6% ).

The total 2018 renewable deliveries shown above were comprised of the following:

As required by California law, the CPUC established a multi-year energy storage procurement framework, including energy storage procurement targets to be
achieved by each load-serving entity under the CPUC jurisdiction, including the Utility. Under the adopted energy storage procurement framework, the Utility is
required to procure 580 MW of qualifying storage capacity by the end of 2021, with all energy storage projects required to be operational by the end of 2024.

The CPUC also adopted biennial interim storage targets for the Utility, beginning in 2014 and ending in 2020. Under the adopted framework, the Utility is required
to submit biennial energy storage procurement plans to describe its strategy to meet its interim and total energy storage targets.

As of November 2018, the Utility had met and exceeded its 2018 interim storage targets and had approximately 35 MW remaining to procure to meet the total
storage targets established by the CPUC. This outcome may change in the future if projects under contract are terminated or if projects that have been approved by
the CPUC are rejected on rehearing.

In 2018, the CPUC approved two proposals for the Utility to own incremental battery storage facilities to be constructed by a third party. The Llagas Energy
Storage Project is a 20 MW project scheduled to come online in 2021. The Moss Landing Project is a 182.5 MW project scheduled to come online by the end of
2020. In addition, the Utility currently owns or operates three battery storage facilities, each less than 10 MW.

(1) The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant consists of two nuclear power reactor units, Units 1 and 2. The NRC operating licenses expire in 2024 and 2025, respectively. On January 11, 2018,
the CPUC approved the Utility’s application to retire Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025. (See “Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in. Item 7. MD&A and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.)
(2) The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 105 generating units at 66 powerhouses. All of the Utility’s powerhouses are licensed by the FERC (except for two small powerhouses not

subject to FERC licensing requirements), with license terms between 30 and 50 years.

(3) The Utility’s large photovoltaic facilities are Cantua solar station (20 MW), Five Points solar station (15 MW), Gates solar station (20 MW), Giffen solar station (10 MW), Guernsey solar
station (20 MW), Huron solar station (20 MW ), Stroud solar station (20 MW), West Gates solar station (10 MW), and Westside solar station (15 MW). All of these facilities are located in
Fresno County, except for Guernsey solar station, which is located in Kings County.

Generation
Resources

Third
Parties

The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase power and electric capacity, including agreements for renewable energy resources, in accordance with
its CPUC-approved procurement plan. (See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” above.) For more information regarding the Utility’s power purchase agreements, see Note
14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Electricity Transmission

At December 31, 2018 , the Utility owned approximately 18,000 circuit miles of interconnected transmission lines operating at voltages ranging from 60 kV to 500
kV. The Utility also operated 84 electric transmission substations with a capacity of approximately 65,000 MVA. The Utility’s electric transmission system is
interconnected with electric power systems in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which includes many western states, Alberta and British Columbia,
and parts of Mexico.

Decisions about expansions and maintenance of the transmission system can be influenced by decisions of the Utility's regulators and the CAISO.

Electricity Distribution

The Utility's electric distribution network consists of approximately 107,000 circuit miles of distribution lines (of which approximately 20% are underground and
approximately 80% are overhead), 50 transmission switching substations, and 769 distribution substations, with a capacity of approximately 32,000 MVA. The
Utility’s distribution network interconnects with its transmission system, primarily at switching and distribution substations, where equipment reduces the high-
voltage transmission voltages to lower voltages, ranging from 44 kV to 2.4 kV, suitable for distribution to the Utility’s customers.

17

These distribution substations serve as the central hubs for the Utility’s electric distribution network. Emanating from each substation are primary and secondary
distribution lines connected to local transformers and switching equipment that link distribution lines and provide delivery to end-users. In some cases, the Utility
sells electricity from its distribution facilities to entities, such as municipal and other utilities, that resell the electricity. The Utility operates electric distribution
control center facilities in Concord, Rocklin, and Fresno, California; these control centers form a key part of the Utility’s efforts to create a smarter, more resilient
grid.

Electricity Operating Statistics

The following table shows certain of the Utility’s operating statistics from 2016 to 2018 for electricity sold or delivered, including the classification of revenues by

Natural Gas Utility Operations

The Utility provides natural gas transportation services to “core” customers (i.e., small commercial and residential customers) and to “non-core” customers (i.e.,
industrial, large commercial, and natural gas-fired electric generation facilities) that are connected to the Utility’s gas system in its service territory.  Core
customers can purchase natural gas procurement service (i.e. ,
natural gas supply) from either the Utility or non-utility third-party gas procurement service
providers (referred to as "core transport agents").  When core customers purchase gas supply from a core transport agent, the Utility continues to provide gas
delivery, metering and billing services to customers.  When the Utility provides both transportation and procurement services, the Utility refers to the combined
service as “bundled” natural gas service.  Currently, more than 97% of core customers, representing approximately 80% of the annual core market demand, receive
bundled natural gas service from the Utility.

18

The Utility generally does not provide procurement service to non-core customers, who must purchase their gas supplies from third-party suppliers, unless the
customer is a natural gas-fired generation facility that the Utility has a power purchase agreement with that includes its generation fuel expense. The Utility offers
backbone gas transmission, gas delivery (local transmission and distribution), and gas storage services as separate and distinct services to its non-core customers.
Access to the Utility's backbone gas transmission system is available for all natural gas marketers and shippers, as well as non-core customers.  The Utility also
delivers gas to off-system customers (i.e., outside of the Utility’s service territory) and to third-party natural gas storage customers.

Natural Gas Supplies

The Utility can receive natural gas from all the major natural gas basins in western North America, including basins in western Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and
the southwestern United States. The Utility can also receive natural gas from fields in California. The Utility purchases natural gas to serve its core customers
directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States. The contract lengths and natural gas sources of the Utility’s portfolio of natural gas
purchase contracts have varied generally based on market conditions. During 2018 , the Utility purchased approximately 287,000 MMcf of natural gas (net of the
sale of excess supply of gas). Substantially all of this natural gas was purchased under contracts with a term of one year or less. The Utility’s largest individual
supplier represented approximately 15% of the total natural gas volume the Utility purchased during 2018 .

Natural Gas System Assets

The Utility owns and operates an integrated natural gas transmission, storage, and distribution system that includes most of northern and central California. At
December 31, 2018 , the Utility’s natural gas system consisted of approximately 43,100 miles of distribution pipelines, over 6,400 miles of backbone and local
transmission pipelines, and various storage facilities. The Utility owns and operates eight natural gas compressor stations on its backbone transmission system and
one small station on its local transmission system that are used to move gas through the Utility’s pipelines. The Utility’s backbone transmission system, composed
primarily of Lines 300, 400, and 401, is used to transport gas from the Utility’s interconnection with interstate pipelines, other local distribution companies, and
California gas fields to the Utility’s local transmission and distribution systems.

The Utility has firm transportation agreements for delivery of natural gas from western Canada to the United States-Canada border with TransCanada NOVA Gas
Transmission, Ltd. interconnecting downstream with TransCanada Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., B.C. System. The Foothills system interconnects at the border to the
pipeline system owned by Gas Transmission Northwest, LLC, which provides natural gas transportation services to a point of interconnection with the Utility’s
natural gas transportation system on the Oregon-California border near Malin, Oregon. The Utility also has firm transportation agreements with Ruby Pipeline,
LLC to transport natural gas from the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas transportation system in the area of Malin,
Oregon, at the California border. Similarly, the Utility has firm transportation agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC and El Paso Natural Gas
Company to transport natural gas from supply points in the Southwestern United States to interconnection points with the Utility's natural gas transportation system
in the area of California near Topock, Arizona. The Utility also has a transportation agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company to transport gas from
the U.S. Rocky Mountains to the interconnection point with the Utility’s natural gas system in the area of Daggett, California. (For more information regarding the
Utility’s natural gas transportation agreements, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

19

The Utility owns and operates three underground natural gas storage fields and has a 25% interest in a fourth storage field, all of which are connected to the
Utility’s transmission system.  The Utility owns and operates compressors and other facilities at these storage fields that are used to inject gas into the fields for
storage and later withdrawal.  In addition, four independent storage operators are interconnected to the Utility's northern California transmission system. Changes
to gas storage safety requirements by DOGGR have led the Utility to develop and propose in its 2019 GT&S rate case application a natural gas storage strategy
which includes the discontinuation (through closure or sale) of operations at two gas storage fields. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7.
MD&A.)

In 2018 , the Utility continued upgrading transmission pipeline to allow for the use of in-line inspection tools and continued its work on the final NTSB
recommendation from its San Bruno investigation to hydrostatically test all high consequence pipeline mileage. The Utility currently plans to complete this NTSB
recommendation by 2022 for remaining short pipeline segments that include tie-in pieces, fittings or smaller diameter off-takes from the larger transmission
pipelines.

Natural Gas Operating Statistics

The following table shows the Utility's operating statistics from 2016 through 2018 (excluding subsidiaries) for natural gas, including the classification of revenues
by type of service. No single customer of the Utility accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues for bundled gas sales in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 .

Competition

Competition in the Electricity Industry

California law allows qualifying non-residential electric customers of investor-owned electric utilities to purchase electricity from energy service providers rather
than from the utilities up to certain annual and overall GWh limits that have been specified for each utility. This arrangement is known as “direct access.” In
addition, California law permits cities, counties, and certain other public agencies that have qualified to become a CCA to generate and/or purchase electricity for
their local residents and businesses. By law, a CCA can procure electricity for all of its residents and businesses that do not affirmatively elect to continue to
receive electricity generated or procured by a utility. In 2018 the California legislature passed a bill to expand the statewide DA cap by 4,000 GWh, and directed
the CPUC to consider whether DA should be further expanded. The CPUC is required to issue an order implementing the expansion by June 1, 2019.

The Utility continues to provide transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services to direct access customers, although these customers can choose to obtain
metering and billing services from their energy service provider. The CCA customers continue to obtain transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services
from the Utility. In addition to collecting charges for transmission, distribution, metering, and billing services that it provides, the Utility is able to collect charges
intended to recover the generation-related costs that the Utility incurred on behalf of direct access and CCA customers while they were the Utility’s customers. The
Utility remains the electricity provider of last resort for these customers.

The Utility is also impacted by the increasing viability of distributed generation and energy storage. The levels of self-generation of electricity by customers
(primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits at the full retail rate, are increasing,
putting upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, utilize time of use rates, and are required to
pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. Significantly
higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers. The CPUC has
indicated that it intends to commence a new proceeding to revisit its rules related to NEM customers in 2019.

Further, in some circumstances, governmental entities such as cities and irrigation districts, which have authority under the state constitution or state statute to
provide retail electric service, may seek to acquire the Utility’s distribution facilities, generally through eminent domain. These same entities may, and sometimes
do, construct duplicate distribution facilities to serve existing or new Utility customers.

The effect of such types of retail competition generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased by customers from the Utility.

The Utility also competes for the opportunity to develop and construct certain types of electric transmission facilities within, or interconnected to, its service
territory through a competitive bidding process managed by the CAISO.

(For risks in connection with increasing competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

Competition in the Natural Gas Industry

The Utility competes with other natural gas pipeline companies for customers transporting natural gas into the southern California market on the basis of
transportation rates, access to competitively priced supplies of natural gas, and the quality and reliability of transportation services. The Utility also competes for
storage services with other third-party storage providers, primarily in northern California.

21

Environmental Regulation

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and
health of the Utility's personnel and the public. These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of activities, including the remediation of hazardous and
radioactive substances; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting and reduction of CO 2 and other GHG emissions; the transportation,
handling, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel; and the environmental impacts of land use, including endangered species and habitat protection. The penalties
for violation of these laws and requirements can be severe and may include significant fines, damages, and criminal or civil sanctions. These laws and requirements
also may require the Utility, under certain circumstances, to interrupt or curtail operations. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors.) Generally, the Utility recovers most of the
costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the Utility's rates, subject to reasonableness review. Environmental costs associated with the clean-
up of most sites that contain hazardous substances are subject to a ratemaking mechanism described in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

Hazardous Waste Compliance and Remediation

The Utility's facilities are subject to various regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended. The Utility is also subject to the regulations adopted
by other federal agencies responsible for implementing federal environmental laws. The Utility also must comply with environmental laws and regulations adopted
by the State of California and various state and local agencies. These federal and state laws impose strict liability for the release of a hazardous substance on the (1)
owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, (2) on companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances, and (3) in
some cases, their corporate successors. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, these persons (known as “potentially
responsible parties”) may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, monitoring and paying for the harm caused to natural
resources, and paying for the costs of health studies.

The Utility has a comprehensive program in place to comply with these federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Under federal and California laws, the Utility
may be responsible for remediation of hazardous substances even if it did not deposit those substances on the site. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen
by the California DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies. The Utility has incurred
significant environmental remediation liabilities associated with former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, sites where natural gas
compressor stations are located, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous substances. Groundwater at the Utility’s
Hinkley and Topock natural gas compressor stations contains hexavalent chromium as a result of the Utility’s past operating practices. The Utility is responsible
for remediating this groundwater contamination and for abating the effects of the contamination on the environment.

For more information about environmental remediation liabilities, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Air Quality and Climate Change

The Utility's electric generation plants, natural gas pipeline operations, vehicle fleet, and fuel storage tanks are subject to numerous air pollution control laws,
including the federal Clean Air Act, as well as state and local statutes. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, those contributing to the
formation of ground-level ozone, CO 2 , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), mono-nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter, and other GHG emissions.

Federal
Regulation

At the federal level, the EPA is charged with implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air Act. Although there have been several legislative attempts to
address climate change through imposition of nationwide regulatory limits on GHG emissions, comprehensive federal legislation has not yet been enacted. In the
absence of federal legislative action, the EPA has used its existing authority under the Clean Air Act to address GHG emissions.

The federal administration of President Donald Trump has led to significant uncertainty with regard to what further actions may occur regarding climate change at
the federal level. In light of the policy reversal at the federal level, the State of California has indicated that it intends to continue and enhance its leadership on
climate change nationally and globally.

22

State
Regulation

California’s AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, provides for the gradual reduction of state-wide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The
CARB has approved various regulations to achieve the 2020 target, including GHG emissions reporting and a state-wide, comprehensive cap-and-trade program
that sets gradually declining limits (or “caps”) on the amount of GHGs that may be emitted by major GHG emission sources within different sectors of the
economy.

The cap-and-trade program’s first compliance period, which began on January 1, 2013, applied to the electric generation and large industrial sectors. The next
compliance period, which began on January 1, 2015, expanded to include the natural gas and transportation sectors, effectively covering all the economy’s major
sectors until 2020. The Utility’s compliance obligation as a natural gas supplier applies to the GHG emissions attributable to the combustion of natural gas
delivered to the Utility’s customers other than natural gas delivery customers that are separately regulated as covered entities and have their own compliance
obligation. During each year of the program, the CARB issues emission allowances (i.e., the rights to emit GHGs) equal to the amount of GHG emissions allowed
for that year. Emitters can obtain allowances from the CARB at quarterly auctions or from third parties or exchanges. Emitters may also satisfy a portion of their
compliance obligation through the purchase of offset credits; e.g., credits for GHG reductions achieved by third parties (such as landowners, livestock owners, and
farmers) that occur outside of the emitters’ facilities through CARB-qualified offset projects such as reforestation or biomass projects.

SB 32 (2016) requires that CARB ensures a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In 2017, AB 398 extended the cap-and-trade
program to 2030. The Utility expects all costs and revenues associated with the GHG cap-and-trade program to be passed through to customers. The California
RPS program that requires the utilities to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy delivered to their customers is also expected to help reduce GHG
emissions in California. In September 2018, SB 100 was signed into law and accelerates the state’s 50% RPS target to December 31, 2026, increases the RPS
target to 60% by December 31, 2030, and further amends the RPS statute to set a policy of meeting 100% of retail sales from eligible renewables and zero-carbon
resources by December 31, 2045.

Climate
Change
Resilience
Strategies

During 2018 , the Utility continued its programs to mitigate the impact of the Utility’s operations (including customer energy usage) on the environment and to
plan for the actions that it will need to take to increase its resilience in light of the impacts of climate change on the Utility’s operations. The Utility regularly
reviews the most relevant scientific literature on climate change such as rising sea levels, major storm events, increasing temperatures and heatwaves, wildfires,
drought and land subsidence, to help the Utility identify and evaluate climate change-related risks and develop the necessary resilience strategies. The Utility
maintains emergency response plans and procedures to address a range of near-term risks, including wildfires, extreme storms, and heat waves and uses its risk-
assessment process to prioritize infrastructure investments for longer-term risks associated with climate change. The Utility also engages with leaders from
business, government, academia, and non-profit organizations to share information and plan for the future.

The Utility is working to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change. In 2017, the Utility filed its first RAMP submittal with the CPUC,
which examined Utility safety risks. The Climate Resilience RAMP model indicated potential additional Utility safety consequences due to climate change,
including in the near term. The Utility is conducting foundational work to help anticipate and plan for evolving conditions in terms of weather and climate-change
related events. This work is guiding efforts to design a Utility-wide climate change risk integration strategy. This strategy will inform resource planning and
investment, operational decisions, and potential additional programs to identify and pursue mitigations that will incorporate the resilience and safety of the Utility’s
assets, infrastructure, operations, employees, and customers.

With respect to electric operations, climate scientists project that, sometime in the next several decades, climate change will lead to increased electricity demand
due to more extreme, persistent, and frequent hot weather. The Utility believes its strategies to reduce GHG emissions through energy efficiency and demand
response programs, infrastructure improvements, and the use of renewable energy and energy storage are effective strategies for adapting to the expected changes
in demand for electricity. The Utility is making substantial investments to build a more modern and resilient system that can better withstand extreme weather and
related emergencies. Over the long-term, the Utility also faces the risk of higher flooding and inundation potential at coastal and low elevation facilities due to sea
level rise combined with high tides, storm runoff and storm surges. As the state continues to face increased risk of wildfires, the Utility’s activities, including
vegetation management, will continue to play an important role to help reduce the risk of wildfire and its impact on electric and gas facilities.

23

Climate scientists predict that climate change will result in varying temperatures and levels of precipitation in the Utility’s service territory. This could, in turn,
affect the Utility’s hydroelectric generation. To plan for this potential change, the Utility is engaging with state and local stakeholders and is also adopting
strategies such as maintaining higher winter carryover reservoir storage levels, reducing discretionary reservoir water releases, and collaborating on research and
new modeling tools.

With respect to natural gas operations, both safety-related pipeline strength testing and normal pipeline maintenance and operations release the GHG methane into
the atmosphere. The Utility has taken steps to reduce the release of methane by implementing techniques including drafting and cross-compression, which reduce
the pressure and volume of natural gas within pipelines prior to venting.  In addition, the Utility continues to achieve reductions in methane emissions by
implementing improvements in leak detection and repair, upgrades at metering and regulating stations, and maintenance and replacement of other pipeline
materials.

Emissions Data

PG&E Corporation and the Utility track and report their annual environmental performance results across a broad spectrum of areas. The Utility reports its GHG
emissions to the CARB and the EPA on a mandatory basis. On a voluntary basis, the Utility reports a more comprehensive emissions inventory to The Climate
Registry, a non-profit organization. The Utility’s third-party verified voluntary GHG inventory reported to The Climate Registry for 2017, the most recent data
available, totaled about
46 million metric tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, more than three-quarters of which came from customer natural gas use. The following table shows the 2017 GHG
emissions data the Utility reported to the CARB under AB 32. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also publish additional GHG emissions data in their annual
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

(2) Since the Utility purchases a portion of its electricity from the wholesale market, the Utility is not able to track some of its delivered electricity back to a specific generator. Therefore, there is

some unavoidable uncertainty in the Utility’s emissions rate.

Air Emissions Data for Utility-Owned Generation

In addition to GHG emissions data provided above, the table below sets forth information about the air emissions from the Utility’s owned generation facilities.
The Utility’s owned generation (primarily nuclear and hydroelectric facilities) comprised more than one-half of the Utility’s delivered electricity in 2017. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility also publish air emissions data in their annual Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

Water Quality

In 2014, the EPA issued final regulations to implement the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act that require cooling water intake structures at electric
power plants, such as the nuclear generation facilities at Diablo Canyon, to reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts.
Various industry and environmental groups have challenged the federal regulations in proceedings pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
California’s once-through cooling policy discussed below is considered to be at least as stringent as the new federal regulations. Therefore, California’s
implementation process for the state policy will likely continue without any significant change.

At the state level, in 2010, the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other
significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for an
alternative compliance approach for nuclear plants if certain criteria were met. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to
evaluate the feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to
the California Water Board in September 2014. The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as
cooling towers.

On June 20, 2016, the Utility entered into a joint proposal with certain parties to retire Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear power reactor units at the expiration of their
current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025. As a result of the planned retirement, the California Water Board will no longer need to address alternative
compliance measures for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, the Utility paid an annual interim mitigation fee beginning in 2017, which it will continue
to pay until operations cease in 2025.

Additionally, the Utility expects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility, the Central Coast
Board and the California Attorney General’s Office regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through cooling discharge. (For more information, see
“Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant” in Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.)

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE and electric utilities with commercial nuclear power plants were authorized to enter into contracts under
which the DOE would be required to dispose of the utilities’ spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste by January 1998, in exchange for fees paid by the
utilities’ customers. The DOE has been unable to meet its contractual obligation with the Utility to dispose of nuclear waste from the Utility’s two nuclear
generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired nuclear facility at Humboldt Bay. As a result, the Utility constructed interim dry cask storage facilities to store its
spent fuel onsite at Diablo Canyon and at Humboldt Bay until the DOE fulfills its contractual obligation to take possession of the spent fuel. The Utility and other
nuclear power plant owners sued the DOE to recover the costs that they incurred to construct interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel.

In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Utility executed a settlement agreement that provided a claims process by which the Utility submits
annual requests for reimbursement of its ongoing spent fuel storage costs.  The claim for the period June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018, totaled approximately $25
million and is currently under review by the DOE.  Amounts reimbursed by DOE are refunded to customers through rates.  A new settlement agreement, for costs
through 2019 was executed in March 2017. Considerable uncertainty continues to exist regarding when and whether the DOE will meet its contractual obligation to
the Utility and other nuclear power plant owners to dispose of spent fuel.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting
policies described in MD&A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results.  The
following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction
with MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows.

25

Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity

PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with their
bankruptcy cases.

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of the
Chapter 11 Cases, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks,
including but not limited to the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11
Cases;

the ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of
any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it
difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner;

the ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of the
Chapter 11 Cases in general;

risks associated with third-party motions or adversary proceedings in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with business operations, including
additional collateral requirements, or the ability to formulate and implement a plan of reorganization;

increased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;

potential for an increase in general unsecured claims as a result of the rejection of any executory contracts or unexpired leases as permitted under the
Bankruptcy Code;

the ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for ongoing operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter or to fund a
plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, including commitments outlined in the Utility's 2020 GRC and other regulatory proceedings;

the potential for a material decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in transactions, including commodity-related transactions,
with PG&E Corporation or the Utility and a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions;

the potential for a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom the Utility has
commercial relationships or adverse developments in the commercial and financial terms on which such providers engage in such relationships with
PG&E Corporation and the Utility;

risks associated with the potential that the Utility will not be able to comply with the capital structure requirements authorized by the CPUC, to the extent
applicable, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter;

potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating key employees and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees during the
pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and thereafter;

the significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather than
focusing exclusively on business operations; and

the ability to continue as a going concern.

26

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who
have claims or interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s plans. These risks and uncertainties could
materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways that cannot be predicted
and may significantly increase the time PG&E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the
Chapter 11 Cases, it is not possible to predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the
Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s corporate and capital structure.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and
certain parties may object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns. Such approvals may be denied,
conditioned or delayed.

Operating under Chapter 11 may restrict the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.

Under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or
industry conditions. These limitations include, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to:

•

sell assets outside the normal course of business;

• make capital investments outside the normal course of business;

•

•

•

consolidate or merge or sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the normal course of business;

grant liens; and

finance operations, investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities, including the ability to achieve California’s renewable energy
goals.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.

As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and their employees will
likely face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to engage, motivate and retain
key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, through
the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of
services of members of senior management could impair PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to execute their strategies and implement operational
initiatives, which would likely have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial
performance.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.
Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to PG&E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets and
liabilities would be adjusted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition and results
of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historical
financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and
related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

27

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have commenced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan of
reorganization with any of its creditors or other key constituents. The Bankruptcy Code gives PG&E Corporation and the Utility the exclusive right to file a plan of
reorganization for 120 days after the filing and, subject to extension for cause, up to a maximum of 18 months from the Petition Date, and prohibits creditors,
equity security holders and others from proposing a plan of reorganization during this period. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have currently retained the
exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until at least May 29, 2019. If that right is terminated, however, or the exclusivity period is not extended or expires,
there could be a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&E
Corporation and the Utility to reach their stated goals.

Accordingly, no assurance can be provided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether a consensual or other plan of
reorganization can be successfully developed and consummated, what the terms of any reorganization of PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be, and what
effect any such plan or reorganization would have on the capital structure (or any part thereof) of PG&E Corporation and the Utility or on any of their respective
equity, debt and other stakeholders, including as to matters of taxation and recovery or distributions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization.

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization within the exclusivity period, one or more third
parties may propose a competing plan of reorganization. PG&E Corporation and the Utility may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of
reorganization from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court, even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe such plan is in their best interest and the
best interests of their stakeholders. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are successful in obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization following the
expiration of their exclusivity period, the process may be lengthy, costly and disruptive. A contested plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a more
pronounced material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan of
reorganization. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain requisite stakeholder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan of
reorganization.

The uncertainty surrounding a prolonged restructuring would also have other material effects on PG&E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to raise additional capital;

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity;

how PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is viewed by regulators, investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies;

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s enterprise value; and

PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing under
Chapter 11. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/or
treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any
claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and may cast substantial doubt on
PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern.

The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity, including PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependent
upon, among other things: (i) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cash
collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP Credit
Agreement, (ii) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to generate cash
flow from operations, (iv) PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternative
restructuring transaction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund any
plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the
reorganization.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of the DIP Credit
Agreement on January 31, 2019 and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and a portion
of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and
the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP
Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the
Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing,
but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final
hearing, or at all. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and
conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility will face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during the pendency of the Chapter 11
Cases, and will have limited, if any, access to additional financing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cash on hand, cash flow from
operations, distributions received from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund operations
during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry
conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from
operations, distributions received from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available,
offered on acceptable terms.

The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conduct
their business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to comply with the
covenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured
or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring
PG&E Corporation and the Utility to provide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. The
DIP Credit Agreement also contains general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessary
governmental authorities, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement include
restrictions on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans
or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-
petition indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility’s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of
certain customary conditions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

29

As a result of these covenants and restrictions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changing
business, market, and economic conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to pursue new business opportunities and
strategies.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtain
a waiver in the event PG&E Corporation or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP
Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, and cash flows.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain exit financing to, among other things, repay borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement, and
even if they are able to obtain such exit financing, the agreement governing such exit financing may significantly restrict PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financing and operational flexibility. The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on obtaining
financings from a number of potential sources, and there can be no assurance that any such financings or other potential sources can be obtained
expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all.

It is expected that the DIP Credit Agreement will be repaid using, in whole or in part, the proceeds from borrowings under exit financings. PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s ability to obtain such exit financing will depend on, among other things, the timing and outcome of various ongoing matters in the Chapter 11
Cases, their business, operations and financial condition, and market conditions. There can be no assurance that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be able to
obtain such exit financings on reasonable economic terms, or at all. If exit financing cannot be obtained, they may not be able to repay the DIP Credit Agreement at
maturity or emerge from bankruptcy. Any exit financing that PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain may include a number of significant restrictive
or financial covenants which could impair their financial and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoing
capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements.

The ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on proceeds received from a number of potential sources. These
potential sources may include financings in the capital and credit markets, securitization, proceeds of asset sales or other dispositions, and other potential sources.
The ability to execute on any such financings or other potential sources will be subject to a variety of factors, many of which will be beyond the control of PG&E
Corporation and the Utility, and may require consent or other action of federal and state regulators (including the FERC and the CPUC), the state legislature and
executive branch, the Bankruptcy Court, other governmental entities, and other potential sources of third-party financing. There can be no assurance that any such
financings or other potential sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue
as a going concern. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 2018
and 2017.  Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's abilities to continue as going concerns. In
addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not included any financial
statement adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that PG&E Corporation and the Utility
will continue as a going concern. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred
in 2018 and 2017. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as
going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report which states certain conditions
exist which raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. In addition, there
is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For further discussion of such uncertainty, see the risk factors above in “Risks Related to
Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity” in this Item 1A. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
these uncertainties. See “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8.

Trading in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.

Trading in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The
ultimate recovery, if any, by holders of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases could differ substantially from any value that may
be implied by the trading prices of such securities at any particular time during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

Risks Related to Wildfires

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses
resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting
from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As detailed below in
Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the
2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires by various plaintiffs, including wildfire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under
multiple theories of liability. These lawsuits generally assert that the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines and
failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.

Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new
lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to such
claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are
determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage,
business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material
adverse effect on PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of
reorganization. (See “The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could
significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows” below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could
be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages under other theories of
liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on
PG&E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization.
Among other things, it is uncertain at this time as to the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current and
future claims that will be settled in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whether
such claims will be allowed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11
Cases.

Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminal
proceeding, and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such actions would not be subject to the automatic stay.

31

As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, based on information made available by the California Department of
Insurance, insurers have received an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the dates noted below related to the 2018
Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims have been submitted and will continue to be
submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The $18.4 billion of insurance claims
described below does not account for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs,
personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages, fines or penalties, or damages for claims related to
the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires that have not manifested yet ("future claims"), each of which could be significant and could materially
affect the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. The scope of all claims related to the 2018
Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law. PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp
fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines
and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than such
amount. As a result, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

Potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of each
fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,
the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,
other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There
are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that
may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility and the treatment of such claims in the Chapter 11 Cases.

For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see “2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires” in Note 13
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in
connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of a number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&E Corporation and the Utility in Sonoma, Napa and San
Francisco Counties’ Superior Courts in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, several of which seek to be certified as class
actions, asserting damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees,
and other damages. Insurance carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires have
filed 48 subrogation complaints in the San Francisco County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence,
inverse condemnation, trespass and nuisance.  The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. Insurance carriers have filed 37 similar
subrogation complaints with respect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have been named
as defendants in securities class action litigation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire.

Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new
lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of
additional lawsuits on account of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases or the Bankruptcy Court could lift the automatic stay with
respect to such pre-petition obligations. Further, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement
actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved through
the Chapter 11 process because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties
and claims involved. The ultimate number and allowed amount of such claims are not presently known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

32

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and
2017 Northern California wildfires, their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, fines
and penalties could be significant and could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows, as well as PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. The Utility has received significant
fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6
billion in connection with natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno explosion”). These penalties
represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of
shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation or the Utility could
likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.

The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the
amount of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurance coverage for wildfire events and securing liability insurance in future years is expected to be
increasingly difficult and expensive, if available at all.

The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s insurance coverage for wildfire events. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have $842 million of insurance coverage for
liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per
occurrence and further retentions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed their
liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019,
comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages
only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was
utilized. In addition, coverage limits within these wildfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed to
be a separate occurrence under the terms of the insurance policies.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to recover the full amount of their insurance. If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full
amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.
Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection
with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance.

In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility’s final liability in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is
known and the Utility could apply for recovery of costs in excess of insurance. While the CPUC has authorized the Utility to track certain wildfire costs in its
WEMA, the Utility will be required to submit a separate request with the CPUC in the future for recovery of those costs.  The Utility may be unable to fully
recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number
of years to collect.

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses, and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp
fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines
and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than such
amount. For further discussion of the potential magnitude of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability, see “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017
Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases” and “PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and
could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California
wildfires” above.

33

Accordingly, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed
their available insurance. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availability
and to face significantly increased insurance costs. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined
through the Chapter 11 process.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount
of third-party liability of the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of
third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2015 Butte fire by various plaintiffs, including individual
plaintiffs, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages. The number of individual
claimants may still increase in the future through the Chapter 11 process.

In connection with the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent, through
the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See “The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are
subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows” below.) In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages
if the Utility were found to have been negligent. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined
through the Chapter 11 process. While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility.

The Utility currently believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. While this amount includes the
Utility’s assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from the
OES. The Utility still does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for that additional claim. A change in
management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of
reorganization. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires
and the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

As of December 31, 2018, the Utility incurred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte
fire in excess of costs currently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA, CEMA and FHPMA accounts.

There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine that
the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. For example, while the CPUC previously approved WEMA tracking
accounts for San Diego Gas & Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company stated it
incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s
prudent manager standard. San Diego Gas & Electric, the Utility, and Southern California Edison filed requests for rehearing of that decision. On July 12, 2018,
the CPUC voted out a decision denying the requests for rehearing. On November 13, 2018, the California Court of Appeal denied San Diego Gas & Electric’s
petition for writ of review, and on January 30, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied San Diego Gas & Electric’s petition for review.

34

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in
the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide
adequate and safe service (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the
issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017
Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018
Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.

On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer
Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC stated
that “consistent with Section 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the
recovery of specific costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims
relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such
costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the
Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and
precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take years to obtain
authorization to securitize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.

On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUC
should (1) promptly set a Customer Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity to
enable PG&E Corporation and the Utility and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capital
needed to resolve claims arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) define
how the Customer Harm Threshold will be applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&E
Corporation and the Utility can raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up to
approximately $3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.

The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner could
have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-
compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-
compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trial
against the Utility in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, among
other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination
after three years. The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the
probation, the Utility has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes
reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive
programs on a Utility-wide basis.

35

In 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing the Utility’s probation, issued various orders related to the Utility’s probation. On November 27, 2018, the court issued an
order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a
series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the terms of its probation. On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the Office of
the California Attorney General advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines would
constitute a crime under California law.” The response of the Utility was submitted on December 31, 2018. On January 3, 2019 and January 4, 2019, the court
issued two new orders requesting further information regarding each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that Cal Fire has attributed to the
Utility’s facilities, and the Utility submitted its responses on January 10, 2019. On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30,
2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believe there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting
requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. In addition, on January 9, 2019, the court issued an order proposing to add new conditions of probation and ordered
the Utility to show cause by January 23, 2019, as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility's response was
submitted on January 23, 2019. On January 30, 2019, the court found that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting
requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. The court issued an order stating that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. For
more information about the Utility’s probation and the court’s orders, see “U.S. District Court Matters and Probation" in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and "U.S.
District Court Matters and Probation” in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic
stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.

The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the
monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, not
recoverable through rates, in the event of modifications to the conditions of its probation.

The Utility’s conviction and the outcome of probation could harm the Utility’s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business
partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcome
of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties
allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with
respect to various aspects of how the Utility’s business is conducted or organized. (See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A.)

The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the
potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
cash flows.

California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability
for attorneys’ fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities’ electric transmission lines. Courts
have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by
the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based
on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation in
lawsuits related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and it is possible that plaintiffs could be successful in
convincing courts to apply this doctrine in these or other litigations. For example, on June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found that
the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal
determination of inverse condemnation liability, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of inverse
condemnation does not apply in the 2015 Butte fire or other litigation against PG&E Corporation or the Utility.

Furthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or
before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to
automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court
decision imposes liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &
Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not
relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas & Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern
California Edison.

36

If PG&E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery decision
from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows of PG&E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017
Northern California wildfires. (See “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially
affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases”, “PG&E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or
enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires” and “PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connection
with the 2015 Butte fire” above.)

Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments.

The Utility’s financial results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC opened
an OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs.
Following SB 901, in applications for cost recovery in connection with the 2017 wildfires, the CPUC is expected to consider the Utility’s financial status and
determine the maximum amount the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service, and ensure
that the costs or expenses that are disallowed for recovery in rates assessed for the wildfires, in the aggregate, do not exceed that amount. The Utility is unable to
predict the timing or outcome of such future determination by the CPUC and its impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

In addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  SB 901
establishes factors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  The Utility is unable to predict the timing
or outcome of the CPUC’s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire mitigation plan implementation, or the
timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities. (See “Regulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Finally, SB 901 established a Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, a
potential state wildfire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The recommendations of the CPUC and the response by the Governor and
legislature to those recommendations could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows. (See “Regulatory Matters - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives” in Item 7. MD&A.)

The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations, PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC’s investigative
enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for
information. The Utility could incur material costs and fines in connection with compliance with penalties from closed investigations or enforcement actions or
in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions.

The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement
proceedings in connection with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII,
safety culture OII, the locate and mark OII, and other matters that the CPUC’s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any
issue it deems appropriate. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases;
however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

37

The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory
penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty is
$100,000, as provided in SB 901. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for
more than one day. While it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be
significant and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liquidity and results of operations. (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1. Business and
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See "Risks Related to Wildfires,"
above.) In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to
allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of, or costs and expenses associate
with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility.

If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial
and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations,
or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for
example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility’s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility’s violations. (See also
“PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-
compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation” above.)

The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws,
regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy
requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety
and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and
environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety
citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility’s ability to
manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner.

As a regulated entity, the Utility’s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient
revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results
could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its
authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility’s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties;
potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility’s
regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility’s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas
services. Further, the increasing amount of Reliability Must Run (“RMR”) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility’s costs of procuring capacity
needed for reliable service to its customers.

In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility’s actual costs to
safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market
circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility’s operations), or
compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag
between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may
disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility.

38

The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a
state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy
efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The
Utility’s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on the
final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand
for the Utility’s electricity and natural gas services.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results depend upon the Utility’s continuing ability to recover “pass-through” costs, including electricity and
natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the
Utility’s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the
Utility’s rates to reflect such events.

The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility’s own generation facilities, electricity
provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market.  The Utility must manage these sources using the
commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of “least cost dispatch” and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-
approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply
with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan.

Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility’s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety
of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower
customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility’s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC’s current approval of the
contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC
reasonableness standard.

The Utility’s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues
to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and
software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices.  The CPUC could prohibit the Utility
from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers.

Further, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through
municipalization of the Utility’s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of
consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See “Competition in the Electricity Industry” in Item 1.) As the number of
bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase
as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable
charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these
costs. In addition, the Utility’s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if
the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to
timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all.

In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-
generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantly
higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers.

39

A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a
viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility’s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility’s ability to recover its generation, transmission,
and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility’s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility’s level of authorized capital
investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to
customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation,
unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Further, changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility’s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE.
Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as “pass-through” costs, a significant and sustained rise in
commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as “pass-through” costs.
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery.

If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of changing
loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology

The Utility’s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affect
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating
system.  (See “Electric Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations” in Item 1. Business above.)  The Utility’s ability to earn its authorized ROE
depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably.  The Utility
undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities.  In addition, the Utility is obligated to
decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025.

The Utility’s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the
Utility’s control, including those that arise from:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause
explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events;

an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating
procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and
uncontained natural gas flow;

the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas
outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;

a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility’s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third
parties;

the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmental
damage, or reputational damage;

the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act;

the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility’s assets are built;

40

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably
should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion);

inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or
extended outages;

operator or other human error;

an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;

construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility’s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or “dig-
ins” that damage the Utility’s underground pipelines;

the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-
based paint from the Utility’s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and

attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war.

The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating
output; damage the Utility’s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers
or others; and cause personal injury or death.  As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to
compensate third parties.  Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility.

Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or
the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor’s work and can be subject to penalties or
other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.  The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other
enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions.

Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under
all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject.  An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or
may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all.

The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility’s ordinary operations.
PG&E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in
future years.  No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility’s insurance coverage.  Uninsured losses and increases in the cost
of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates.  A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

As a result of the potential application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by
insurance companies, the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires,
and the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all.  In addition, the Utility is
unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses.

If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of
any uninsured losses, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

41

The electric power industry is undergoing significant change driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially
affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned
generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy.  The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy
technologies that support California's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers.
California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change.  For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law on
September 10, 2018, increases from 50% to 60%, the percentage of California’s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes a
further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers
and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies.  These developments
will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, and
interconnect DERs.

In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency
programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects).

To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher
penetration of DERs and, consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs,
and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid
operator. The CPUC also authorized development of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combating
climate change. The new programs will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles.

The industry change, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility’s
inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric industry, could materially affect the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows.

A cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility’s operational networks and information technology systems could
have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility’s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication
technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks.
Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense,
Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and
frequency.  The Utility’s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new
technologies and control systems.  Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility’s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees,
significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility’s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the
most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility’s assets or operations or those of third parties.

The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information,
including the Utility’s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their
dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to
provide other services to the Utility or the Utility’s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including
customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California’s electricity market related to grid modernization and
customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility’s systems and information, or experience
security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility’s information technology systems could impact the Utility’s ability to
track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.

42

The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the
Utility’s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility’s operations.  None
of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.  Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the
Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations.  Such
events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy
laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents.  However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will
continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by
insurance or recoverable in rates.

The operation and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to
fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire.

The operation of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as
risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity,
natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could
have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be
required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon facility but
at any other nuclear power plant in the United States.

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about
the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the
actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail,
regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes
in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility’s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before
their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered
investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows.

In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur
costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development
program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility.  In its January 11, 2018
decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $211.3 million and in its November 29, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $352.1 million
as originally requested by the Utility for an employee retention program, but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled
personnel under such program.

The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders.  (See “Regulatory Environment” in Item 1.
Business above.)  If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results could be materially affected.  The Utility
may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC
may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions.  The Utility may incur a material charge if it
ceases operations at Diablo Canyon’s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2018, the Utility’s
unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion.

43

The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at
the end of their useful lives.  (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - "Asset Retirement Obligations" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statement in Item 8.)  The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning
charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit.  If the
Utility’s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

For certain critical technologies, products and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers.  In the event these
suppliers are unable to perform, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers.

The Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services.  Although the Utility has long-term agreements
with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while it
implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers.  As a result, the Utility’s business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be materially affected.  As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (recently acquired by Brookfield Business
Partners L.P.) for its nuclear fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter™ devices and
software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers.  If these suppliers
encounter performance difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems,
the Utility’s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted.

44

Risks Related to Environmental Factors

Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Extreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility's
service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition
events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive
additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events.  In California, over the past
five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult
to manage.  In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility’s service area as a result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations
in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors.
Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices.  The combined effects of extreme
weather and climate change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires than the annual average, including five of
the most devastating wildfires in California's history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of
the Utility's service territory is facing "elevated" or "extreme" fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility's nearly 81,000 distribution overhead
circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in total
than other California IOUs.

Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, rising
sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged
power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&E Corporation
and the Utility.  Any such event could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows.  Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances,
particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility’s
practices and/or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility.

Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the
Utility’s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant.  Scientists project that
climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather.  As a result, the Utility’s hydroelectric generation could change
and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation.  If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to
replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In
addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility’s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets.  The
Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries.  The
Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may
increase.

Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility’s operations than the Utility’s studies suggest and could result in lower
revenues or increased expenses, or both.  If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility’s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change,
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.

45

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s
and the Utility’s financial results.

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage,
remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other
costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to
pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the
Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination,
remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 14 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more
expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or
permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other
sanctions.

The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these
mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The
CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has
authorized the Utility to recover in rates.

Some of the Utility’s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates
or insurance. (See “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility’s costs to
remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to
have, a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated
costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities.

State climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.  Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the
potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain.

The CARB is the state’s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs.  Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB’s Cap-and-
Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will
be reflected in customer bills. CARB’s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas.  These include more aggressive
energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and
replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand.  These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by
CARB’s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications.  CARB also proposes a displacement of
some conventional natural gas with above-market renewable natural gas.  The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas
customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk.

Other Risk Factors

The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility’s business and the Utility
may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal.

The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued
operation of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of
the Utility’s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other
governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and
licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In
addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation
facility.

46

If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment
charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility’s compliance costs.
In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility’s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license
conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility.

In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been
previously required to obtain.

The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with
necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance
and other costs in a timely manner, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially
affected.

Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension
plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also
maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value
of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and
other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on
plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government
regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust
assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or
forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and
postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the
contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be
materially affected.

The Utility’s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements
which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified
personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur.

The Utility’s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to
recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’s
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew
the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented
Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the
reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could
materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

47

The Utility’s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique to
California.

The Utility’s business activities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility’s future performance may be affected by events and economic
factors unique to California or by regional regulation or legislation, for example the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See “The doctrine of inverse
condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from
such litigation and materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows” above.)

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Utility owns or has obtained the right to occupy and/or use real property comprising the Utility's electricity and natural gas distribution facilities, electric
generation facilities, natural gas gathering facilities and generation facilities, and natural gas and electricity transmission facilities, which are described in Item 1.
Business, under “Electric Utility Operations” and “Natural Gas Utility Operations.” The Utility occupies or uses real property that it does not own primarily
through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities. In total, the Utility occupies 11 million
square feet of real property, including 8 million square feet owned by the Utility. The Utility's corporate headquarters comprises approximately 1.7 million square
feet located in several Utility-owned buildings in San Francisco, California.

PG&E Corporation also leases approximately 42,000 square feet of office space from a third party in San Francisco, California. This lease will expire in 2022.

The Utility currently owns approximately 160,000, acres of land, including approximately 131,000 acres of watershed lands. In 2002 the Utility agreed to
implement its LCC to permanently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent protections,
as well as to make approximately 70,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations. The six “beneficial public values” being
preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agricultural
uses; and historic values. The Utility’s goal is to implement all the transactions needed to implement the LCC by the end of 2022, subject to securing all required
regulatory approvals.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In addition to the following proceedings, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of
their business.  For more information regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see Item 7. MD&A, and Notes 13, 14, and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 .

U.S. District Court Matters and Probation

On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San
Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management
regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced the
Utility to a five-year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after
three years, a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.

The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility
has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate
steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide
basis.

48

On November 27, 2018, the court overseeing the Utility’s probation, issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern
District of California (the “USAO”) and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the terms
of its probation, including what requirements of the Utility’s probation “might be implicated were any wildfire started by reckless operation or maintenance of
PG&E power lines” or “might be implicated by any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire by PG&E.” The court also ordered the
Utility to provide “an accurate and complete statement of the role, if any, of PG&E in causing and reporting the recent 2018 Camp fire in Butte County and all
other wildfires in California” since January 2017 (“Question 4 of the November 27 Order”). On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the
Office of the California Attorney General advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines
would constitute a crime under California law.” The responses of the Attorney General were submitted on December 28, 2018, and the responses of the Utility, the
USAO and the third-party monitor were submitted on December 31, 2018.

On January 3, 2019, the court issued a new order requiring that the Utility provide further information regarding the Atlas fire.  the court noted that “[t]his order
postpones the question of the adequacy of PG&E’s response” to Question 4 of the November 27 Order.  On January 4, 2019, the court issued another order
requiring that the Utility provide “with respect to each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that [Cal Fire] has attributed to [the Utility’s]
facilities,” information regarding the wind conditions in the vicinity of each fire’s origin and information about the equipment allegedly involved in each fire’s
ignition.  The responses of the Utility were submitted on January 10, 2019.

On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believe
there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.  In addition, on January 9, 2019,
the court issued an order (the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:

•

•

•

prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-wind
conditions, . . . identify and fix all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]
identify and fix damaged or weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its grid
similar to any condition that contributed to any previous wildfires”,

“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions” and

at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the wind
conditions then prevailing.”

The Utility was ordered to show cause by January 23, 2019 as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed.  The Utility's
response was submitted on January 23, 2019. The court requested that Cal Fire file a public statement, and invited the CPUC to comment, by January 25, 2019.  On
January 30, 2019, the court found that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.
The court issued an order stating that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. Also on January 30, 2019, the court ordered the
Utility to submit to the court on February 6, 2019 the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan that the Utility was required to submit to the CPUC by February 6, 2019 in
accordance with SB 901, and invited interested parties to comment on such plan by February 20, 2019. In addition, on February 14, 2019, the court ordered the
Utility to provide additional information, including on its vegetation clearance requirements. The Utility submitted its response to the court on February 22, 2019.
As of February 24, 2019, to the Utility’s knowledge, no parties have submitted comments to the court on the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan.

49

Order Instituting an Investigation into the Utility’s Safety Culture

On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility
prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards. The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the
Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of
operations, including its record of safety incidents. The SED engaged a consultant to assist in the SED’s investigation and the preparation of a report containing the
SED’s assessment, and subsequently, to report on the implementation by the Utility of the consultant's recommendations.

On May 8, 2017, the CPUC released the consultant’s report, accompanied by a scoping memo and ruling. The scoping memo established a second phase in the OII
in which the CPUC evaluated the safety recommendations of the consultant. Phase two of the proceeding also considered all necessary measures, including, but not
limited to, a potential reduction of the Utility’s return on equity. On November 17, 2017, the CPUC issued a phase two scoping memo and procedural schedule.
The scoping memo directed the Utility to file testimony addressing a number of issues including: adoption of the safety recommendations from the consultant, the
Utility’s implementation process for the safety recommendations of the consultant, the Utility’s Board of Director’s actions and initiatives related to safety culture
and the consultant’s recommendations, the Utility’s corrective action program, and the Utility’s response to certain specified safety incidents that occurred in 2013
through 2015.

The Utility’s testimony was submitted to the CPUC on January 8, 2018 and stated that the Utility agrees with all the recommendations of the consultant and
supports their adoption by the CPUC. Other parties’ responsive testimony was submitted on February 16, 2018, followed by the Utility’s rebuttal testimony on
February 23, 2018.

On November 29, 2018, the CPUC approved the PD in connection with this proceeding. The decision directed the Utility to implement the recommendations set
forth in the May 2017 consultant report no later than July 1, 2019, and to submit quarterly reports on the Utility's implementation status beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2018.

On December 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a Scoping Memo and Ruling (the “Scoping Memo”) setting forth the scope to be addressed in the next phase of its
ongoing investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately directs
resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The Scoping Memo provides that the CPUC “will examine
[PG&E’s] current corporate governance, structure, and operations to determine if the utility is positioned to provide safe electrical and gas service, and will review
alternatives to the current management and operational structures of providing electric and gas service in Northern California.”

In the Scoping Memo, the CPUC alleges that the Utility has had “serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years” and despite
penalties and other remedial measures in connection with these problems, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have failed to develop “a comprehensive enterprise-
wide approach to addressing safety.” The Scoping Memo outlines a number of proposals to address the CPUC’s concerns regarding PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s safety culture, including, but not limited to, (i) replacement of all or part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s existing boards of directors and
corporate management, (ii) separating the Utility’s gas and electric distribution and transmission businesses into separate companies, (iii) reorganizing the Utility
into regional subsidiaries based on regional distinctions, (iv) reconstituting the Utility as a publicly owned utility or utilities, (v) providing for entities other than
the Utility to provide generation services and (vi) conditioning the Utility’s return on equity on safety performance. The Scoping Memo does not propose penalties
and states that this phase “is not a punitive phase.” The Utility submitted its background filing to the CPUC on January 16, 2019 and opening comments were filed
on February 13, 2019. Reply comments are due on February 28, 2019.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether additional fines, penalties, or other ratemaking tools such as a potential reduction of the Utility's
return on equity will be adopted by the CPUC in future phases of this proceeding.

Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant

The Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant employs a “once-through” cooling water system that is regulated under a Clean Water Act permit issued by the Central
Coast Board. This permit allows the Diablo Canyon power plant to discharge the cooling water at a temperature no more than 22 degrees above the temperature of
the ambient receiving water, and requires that the beneficial uses of the water be protected.  The beneficial uses of water in this region include industrial water
supply, marine and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting, and preservation of rare and endangered species.  In January 2000, the Central Coast Board issued a
proposed draft cease and desist order alleging that, although the temperature limit has never been exceeded, the Utility's Diablo Canyon power plant's discharge
was not protective of beneficial uses.

In October 2000, the Utility and the Central Coast Board reached a tentative settlement under which the Central Coast Board agreed to find that the Utility's
discharge of cooling water from the Diablo Canyon power plant protects beneficial uses and that the intake technology reflects the best technology available, as
defined in the federal Clean Water Act.  As part of the tentative settlement, the Utility agreed to take measures to preserve certain acreage north of the plant and to
fund approximately $6 million in environmental projects and future environmental monitoring related to coastal resources.  On March 21, 2003, the Central Coast
Board voted to accept the settlement agreement.  On June 17, 2003, the settlement agreement was executed by the Utility, the Central Coast Board and the
California Attorney General's Office.  A condition to the effectiveness of the settlement agreement was that the Central Coast Board renew Diablo Canyon's
permit.

However, at its July 10, 2003 meeting, the Central Coast Board did not renew the permit and continued the permit renewal hearing indefinitely.  Several Central
Coast Board members indicated that they no longer supported the settlement agreement, and the Central Coast Board requested a team of independent scientists to
develop additional information on possible mitigation measures for Central Coast Board staff.  In 2005, the Central Coast Board reviewed the scientists' draft
report recommending several such mitigation measures, but no action was taken.

In 2010, the California Water Board adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant
measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. The policy also provided for an alternative
compliance approach for nuclear plants if certain criteria were met. As required by the policy, the California Water Board appointed a committee to evaluate the
feasibility and cost of using alternative technologies to achieve compliance at Diablo Canyon. The committee’s consultant submitted its final report to the
California Water Board in September 2014. The report addressed feasibility, costs and timeframes to install alternative technologies at Diablo Canyon, such as
cooling towers.

On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon Unit 1 by 2024 and Unit 2 by 2025. As a result of the planned retirement, the California
Water Board will no longer need to address alternative compliance measures for Diablo Canyon. As required under the policy, starting in 2017, the Utility pays an
annual interim mitigation fee, which it will continue to pay until operations cease in 2025. Additionally, the Utility expects that its decision to retire Diablo Canyon
will affect the terms of a final settlement agreement between the Utility and the Central Coast Board regarding the thermal component of the plant’s once-through
cooling discharge.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the Utility’s financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is the Utility, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The Utility
generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.

The Utility’s base revenue requirements are set by the CPUC in its GRC and GT&S rate case and by the FERC in its TO rate cases based on forecast
costs.  Differences between forecast costs and actual costs can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces
on the cost of labor and materials.  Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level.  Generally,
differences between actual costs and forecast costs affect the Utility’s ability to earn its authorized return (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted
Earnings” in Results of Operations below).  However, for certain operating costs, such as costs associated with pension benefits, the Utility is authorized to track
the difference between actual amounts and forecast amounts and recover or refund the difference through rates (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did
not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).  The Utility also collects revenue requirements to recover certain costs that the CPUC has authorized the
Utility to pass on to customers, such as the costs to procure electricity or natural gas for its customers.  Therefore, although these costs can fluctuate, they generally
do not impact net income (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” in Results of Operations below).   See “Ratemaking
Mechanisms” in Item 1. Business for further discussion.

55

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities.  This
combined MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8.

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation's and the
Utility’s Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088
(DM).

PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As debtors in possession, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are
authorized to continue to operate as ongoing businesses, and may pay all debts and honor all obligations arising in the ordinary course of their businesses after the
Petition Date. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not pay third-party claims or creditors on account of obligations arising before the Petition Date or
engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, third-party actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness owed by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as well as most litigation pending
against PG&E Corporation and the Utility (including the third-party matters described under Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8), are subject to an automatic stay. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court providing otherwise, substantially all pre-petition liabilities will be administered
under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization to be voted upon by creditors and other stakeholders, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. However, under the
Bankruptcy Code, regulatory or criminal proceedings are generally not subject to an automatic stay, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect these
proceedings to continue during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

To assure ordinary course operations, on January 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of
“first day” motions, including motions that authorize them to maintain their existing cash management system, to continue wage and salary payments and other
benefits to their employees, to secure debtor in possession financing and other customary relief. On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received
final approval of the first day motion to continue wage and salary payments and other benefits to their employees (with one limited objection with respect to a
discrete matter having been preserved by the Bankruptcy Court) and certain other first day motions for customary relief. Hearings on certain other first day
motions, including a hearing to consider final approval of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motions to continue their existing cash management system and to
approve their debtor in possession financing, have not been held and no assurances can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will approve such motions on a final
basis. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing with respect to such motions, but there are hearings currently scheduled
for March 12, March 13 and March 27, 2019.

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, among the Utility, as borrower, PG&E
Corporation, as guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the DIP Lenders. The DIP Credit
Agreement provides for $5.5 billion in the form of (i) the DIP Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion, including a $1.5 billion letter of credit
subfacility, (ii) the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and (iii) the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $500 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of the DIP
Credit Agreement on January 31, 2019, and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and a
portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E
Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit
subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and
unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final
hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the
final hearing, or at all.

56

Borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement are senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to
superpriority administrative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by
PG&E Corporation, and such guarantee is a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and
entitled to superpriority administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31,
2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an
extension fee. The Utility paid customary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the DIP Credit Agreement.

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of the debt
outstanding under or in respect of certain instruments and agreements relating to direct financial obligations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility (the “Accelerated
Direct Financial Obligations”). Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated Direct Financial
Obligations, together with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable. However,
any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the outstanding senior notes, agreements in respect of
certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's
revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The filing of the
Chapter 11 Cases may also provide the counterparties under certain commodity and related agreements with the right to declare an event of default and to seek
termination of such agreements, with such rights subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. (For more
information, see "Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations" in Item 7. MD&A.)

Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, certain post-petition and secured or “priority” pre-petition liabilities need to be satisfied before
general unsecured creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s equity are entitled to receive any distribution. No assurance can be given as to
what values, if any, will be ascribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to the claims and interests of each of these constituencies. Additionally, no assurance can be given as
to whether, when or in what form unsecured creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation's or the Utility’s equity may receive a distribution on such claims or
interests.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,
including, without limitation, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Any
description of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunder
or a quantification of their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights PG&E Corporation and the Utility have
under the Bankruptcy Code.

For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of bankruptcy. For example, the
Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s relationships with suppliers and employees which, in turn, could adversely affect
the value of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business and assets. At this time, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases
on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business or various creditors, or whether or when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will emerge from bankruptcy.
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future results depend upon the confirmation, and successful implementation, on a timely basis, of a Chapter 11 plan of
reorganization. For a discussion of the significant risks and uncertainties related to the Chapter 11 Cases, see “Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and
Liquidity” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Going Concern

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
continuity of operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are
facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. As a result of these challenges,
such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California
wildfires, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Item 7. MD&A, and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

57

Management has concluded that uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as
going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors’ report which states certain conditions
exist which raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. The Consolidated
Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. For more information about these matters, see Note 1
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Item 8.

Summary of Changes in Net Income and Earnings per Share

PG&E Corporation’s net losses available for common shareholders were $6.9 billion in 2018, compared to net income available for common shareholders of $1.6
billion in 2017. In 2018, PG&E Corporation recognized charges of $14 billion (pre-tax), offset by probable insurance recoveries of $2.2 billion (pre-tax),
associated with third-party claims and legal and other costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.

Key Factors Affecting Financial Results

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the following
factors:

•

•

The
Outcome
of
the
Chapter
11
Cases.
For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s business is subject to the risks and
uncertainties of bankruptcy. For example, the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect the Utility’s relationships with suppliers and employees which, in
turn, could adversely affect the value of the business and assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also expect to
incur increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization. At this time, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on their business or various creditors, or whether or when PG&E Corporation and the Utility will emerge
from bankruptcy. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows depend upon confirming,
and successfully implementing, on a timely basis, a plan of reorganization.

The
Utility’s
Ability
to
Fund
Ongoing
Operations
and
Other
Capital
Needs.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of
credit subfacility) was made available. The remainder of the DIP Facilities are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the
Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing.  For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
expect that the DIP Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and distributions received from subsidiaries, will be the
Utility’s primary source of capital to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs and that they will have limited, if any, access to additional
financing. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries, and availability under the DIP Credit
Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can
provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms.  The amount of any such additional
financing could be limited by negative covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement, which include restrictions on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's ability
to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets.

•

The
Impact
of
Wildfires.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility face several uncertainties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern
California wildfires, related to: the amount of possible loss related to third-party claims (in 2018, the Utility recorded total charges of $13.4 billion, which
reflects the low end of the range of reasonably estimated losses and is subject to change based on additional information), which aggregate possible
losses, if the Utility were found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern
California wildfires (other than potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims), could exceed $30 billion; punitive
damages, which could be material; fines or penalties, which could be material, if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement
action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations; the amount of damages in respect of future claims, which
could be material; the applicability of the doctrine of inverse condemnation in the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires litigation,
which the Utility intends to continue to challenge during the pendency of its Chapter 11 Case; the applicability of other theories of liability, including
negligence, related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfire claims; the recoverability of the above mentioned costs, even if a court
decision imposes liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation; the amount of the Customer Harm Threshold under SB 901 and the timing of any
recovery by the Utility in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold in a proceeding before the CPUC; and recoverability of clean-up and repair costs (the
Utility incurred costs of $681 million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities through December 31, 2018). (See Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and Item 1A. Risk Factors.)

The
Outcome
of
Other
Enforcement,
Litigation,
and
Regulatory
Matters
. The Utility’s financial results may continue to be impacted by the outcome of
other current and future enforcement, litigation (to the extent not stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases), and regulatory matters, including the
outcome of the Locate and Mark OII, phase two of the Safety Culture OII, the outcome of phase two of the ex parte OII, the sentencing terms of the
Utility’s January 27, 2017 federal criminal conviction, including the oversight of the Utility’s probation and the potential recommendations by the third-
party monitor, and potential penalties in connection with the Utility’s safety and other self-reports. (See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

. The Utility’s financial results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its 2019 GT&S rate
case, 2020 GRC, FERC TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate cases, future cost of capital proceedings, and its ability to timely recover costs not in rates already
incurred and to be incurred in the future, including those tracked in its CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA and the Utility's 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan. The outcome
of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the Utility’s reputation, the
regulatory and political environments, and other factors. (See Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and
“Regulatory Matters” below.)

The
Utility’s
Compliance
with
the
CPUC
Capital
Structure
. The CPUC’s capital structure decisions require the Utility to maintain a 52% equity ratio on
average over the period that the authorized capital structure is in place, and to file an application for a waiver to the capital structure condition if an
adverse financial event reduces its equity ratio by 1% or more. The CPUC’s decisions state that the Utility shall not be considered in violation of these
conditions during the period the waiver application is pending resolution. Due to the net charges recorded in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and the
2017 Northern California wildfires as of December 31, 2018, the Utility intends to submit to the CPUC an application for a waiver of the capital structure
condition on February 28, 2019. The waiver is subject to CPUC approval. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of its waiver
application.

For more information about the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash
flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the 2018 Form 10-K.  In addition, this 2018 Form 10-K
contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions
that are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge of
facts as of the date of this report.  See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” below for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to
differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update
forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion presents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating results for 2018, 2017, and 2016.  See “Key Factors Affecting Financial
Results” above for further discussion about factors that could affect future results of operations.

PG&E Corporation’s net income (loss) primarily consists of income taxes and interest expense on long-term debt and other income from investments.  The
decrease in PG&E Corporation’s net loss for 2018, as compared to 2017, is primarily due to the impact of the San Bruno Derivative Litigation in 2017 with no
corresponding activity in 2018, partially offset by additional income taxes in 2017.

PG&E Corporation's net income decreased in 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act and interest expense, partially offset by the
impact of the San Bruno Derivative Litigation.

Utility

The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2018, 2017, and 2016.  The table separately identifies the revenues
and costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such
as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover
those pass-through costs, do not impact earnings.  In addition, expenses that have been specifically authorized (such as energy procurement costs) and the
corresponding revenues the Utility is authorized to collect to recover such costs, do not impact earnings.

60

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets
and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs
to own and operate its assets.

The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2018, 2017, and 2016, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these
periods.

Operating Revenues

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $39 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased base
revenues authorized in the 2017 GRC, partially offset by tax benefits resulting from the Tax Act expected to be returned to customers. See "Regulatory Matters"
below.

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased $144 million , or 1% , in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher
electric transmission revenues.

61

Operating and Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings increased $363 million , or 7% , in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to $209 million
for clean up and repair costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, as compared to $17 million relating to the 2017 Northern
California wildfires charged in 2017. Also, the Utility recorded charges of $187 million in additional legal and other costs relating to the 2017 Northern California
wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire (the Utility recorded $205 million for legal and other costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp
fire in 2018, as compared to $18 million in 2017). The Utility also recorded charges of $121 million reflecting the additional write off of insurance premiums for
single event coverage policies (the Utility recorded $185 million in 2018 for the write off of insurance premiums, as compared to $64 million in 2017). These
increases were partially offset by a $38 million reduction to the estimated disallowance for gas-related capital costs that were expected to exceed authorized
amounts in 2018, compared to a $47 million disallowance recorded in 2017 related to the Diablo Canyon settlement. Additionally, the increases were offset by a
decrease in legal and other costs relating to the 2015 Butte fire of $20 million in 2018 compared to 2017 (the Utility recorded $40 million for legal and other costs
relating to the 2015 Butte fire in 2018 as compared to $60 million in 2017).

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased $550 million, or 10%, in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, the Utility incurred
$455 million less in disallowed charges (the Utility recorded a $47 million disallowance related to the Diablo Canyon settlement in 2017 as compared to $502
million of disallowed capital charges related to the San Bruno Penalty Decision and 2015 GT&S rate case decision in 2016). This decrease was partially offset by a
$64 million write off of insurance premiums for single event coverage policies recorded in 2017, with no corresponding activity in 2016. Additionally, the decrease
was offset by a $51 million increase in legal and other costs (the Utility recorded $18 million relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and $60 million
relating to the 2015 Butte fire in 2017, as compared to $27 million relating to the 2015 Butte fire in 2016).

Wildfire-related claims, net of insurance recoveries

Costs related to wildfires that impacted earnings increased by $ 11.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2018, the Utility recognized charges of $ 14 billion,
offset by probable insurance recoveries of $ 2.2 billion associated with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. In 2017, the Utility recognized
a charge of $350 million, offset by probable insurance recoveries of $350 million related to the 2015 Butte fire.

In 2016, the Utility recognized a $750 million charge, offset by probable insurance recoveries of $625 million related to the 2015 Butte fire.

Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning

The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $182 million , or 6% , in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to capital
additions. In 2017, the Utility's depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $100 million, or 4%, compared to 2016, primarily due to
the impact of capital additions and higher depreciation rates as authorized by the CPUC in the 2017 GRC.

Interest Income

The Utility's interest income increased by $ 44 million, or 147% , in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher interest rates affecting various regulatory
balancing accounts and fluctuations in those accounts. There was no material change in the Utility's interest income in 2017 as compared to 2016. The Utility's
interest income is primarily affected by changes in regulatory balancing accounts and changes in interest rates.

Interest Expense

The Utility’s interest expense increased by $37 million , or 4% , in 2018 compared to 2017. The Utility’s interest expenses increased by $58 million, or 7%, in
2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.

Other Income, Net

The Utility's other income, net increased by $ 39 million, or 60% , in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in AFUDC as the average balance of
construction work in progress was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017. There was no material change in the Utility's other income, net in 2017 as compared to
2016.

62

Income Tax Provision

The Utility’s income tax provision decreased $3.7 billion in 2018 compared to 2017.  The decrease in the income tax provision and increase in the effective tax rate
were primarily the result of pre-tax losses in 2018 versus pre-tax income in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%
as a result of the Tax Act.

The Utility’s income tax provision increased $357 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in the tax provision was primarily the result of the statutory tax
effect of higher pre-tax income in 2017 compared to 2016 and an adjustment required to record the change in deferred tax balances due to tax reform in 2017 with
no comparable adjustment in 2016.

The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision:

deductions.

(2) Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs as authorized by the 2014 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31,
2017), the 2017 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31, 2018), and by the 2015 GT&S decision which impacted all periods presented.  All amounts are impacted by
the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC, 2017 GRC, and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for temporary
income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the Utility
recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted
as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered
from or returned to customers in future rates.  In 2018, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax
Act passed in December 2017.

(3) Primarily represents adjustments to compensation as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act.
(4) Represents adjustments to deferred tax balances under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 reflecting the tax rate reduction required by the Tax Act.
(5) These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settlements.

Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information.

63

Cost of Electricity

The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), transmission, fuel used in its own
generation facilities, fuel supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains
and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The Utility’s total purchased power
is driven by customer demand, the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-
effectiveness of each source of electricity.

(1) Average cost of purchased power was impacted primarily by lower Utility electric customer demand, driven by customer departures to CCAs or direct access providers, and a larger

percentage of higher cost renewable energy resources being allocated to the fewer remaining Utility electric customers. See further discussion in “Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives -
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment,” below.

(2) The decrease in purchased power for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower Utility electric customer demand.

Cost of Natural Gas

The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade
program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities.  (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)  The
Utility’s cost of natural gas is impacted by the market price of natural gas, changes in the cost of storage and transportation, and changes in customer demand.

The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred such as pension contributions
and public purpose programs costs.  If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact to earnings.  For 2018, 2017,
and 2016, no material amounts were incurred above authorized amounts.

Other Income, Net

The Utility’s other income, net that did not impact earnings includes pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that fluctuate primarily from market and
interest rate changes.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Overview

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. In connection with the
Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into a DIP Credit Agreement. On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion
seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the DIP Facilities. On January 31, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court provided interim approval of the DIP
Facilities and on February 1, 2019, the DIP Credit Agreement was executed and became effective and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of
$1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the
remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP
Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability
thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13,
2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final hearing, or at all. (For more information on
the DIP Credit Agreement, see "DIP Credit Agreement" below and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures and pay other ongoing expenses and make
distributions to PG&E Corporation will primarily depend on the levels of its operating cash flows and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement. The Utility
expects that the DIP Facilities will provide it with sufficient liquidity to fund its ongoing operations, including its ability to provide safe service to customers,
during the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation's ability to fund operations and pay other ongoing expenses will
primarily depend on cash on hand and intercompany transfers. In the event that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's capital needs increase materially due to
unexpected events or transactions, additional financing outside of the DIP Facilities may be required, which would be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.
Such approval is not assured. For more information on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's material commitments for capital expenditures, see "Regulatory
Matters" below.

During 2018 and January 2019, PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's credit ratings were subject to multiple downgrades by Fitch, S&P and Moody's including to
ratings below investment grade and ultimately to “D” or low “C” ratings. Effective February 5, 2019, Moody's has withdrawn each of its credit ratings for PG&E
Corporation and the Utility as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's credit ratings ceasing to be rated at investment
grade, the Utility has been required to post additional collateral under its commodity purchase agreements, and other obligations, and has been exposed to
significant constraints on its customary trade credit. In addition, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be required to post additional collateral in respect of
certain other obligations, including workers' compensation and environmental remediation obligations. (See Notes 9 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and the
Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds.

As of December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had unconsolidated cash and cash equivalent balances of $373 million and $ 1.3 billion, respectively.
On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had unconsolidated cash and cash equivalent balances of $370 million and $490 million (including
approximately $250 million of customer deposits and cash held from counterparties by the Utility), respectively. Starting in early January 2019, the Utility's cash
and cash equivalent balance decreased by approximately $811 million to satisfy collateral posting needs, address accelerated payment and pre-pay demands of
energy commodity suppliers, and to address requests from other essential suppliers for shortened payment terms or elimination of credit lines. As of February 27,
2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had unconsolidated cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately $480 million and $1.7 billion, respectively.

65

Financial Resources

Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of the
Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations. Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated Direct
Financial Obligations, together with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable.
However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include all outstanding senior notes, agreements in
respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation’s and
the Utility’s revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

DIP Credit Agreement

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim
approval of the DIP Credit Agreement on January 31, 2019, and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on
February 1, 2019, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made
available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion
letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain
unavailable until and unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to
predict the date of the final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final
approval of the DIP Facilities at the final hearing, or at all.

Borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement are senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to
superpriority administrative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by
PG&E Corporation, and such guarantee is a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and
entitled to superpriority administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31,
2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an
extension fee. The Utility paid customary fees and expenses in connection with obtaining the DIP Credit Agreement. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for a more detailed description of the DIP Credit Agreement.

As of February 28, 2019, the Utility had outstanding borrowings of $350 million under the DIP Revolving Facility, and $30 million in face amount of outstanding
letters of credit, with remaining availability of $1.12 billion under the DIP Revolving Facility.

CPUC Authorization of DIP Credit Agreement

On January 28, 2019, the CPUC granted the Utility exemptions from the requirement of prior CPUC approval for issuance of debt instruments for the incurrence of
the DIP financing. The CPUC also indicated its position that the exemptions do not extend to the transfer of ownership of any Utility asset that is pledged as part of
the DIP financing and that in the event of the Utility’s default under the DIP financing, the Utility would need to seek the CPUC’s approval to execute such a
transfer. Further, the CPUC indicated that the Utility’s “expenditure of the initial DIP financing funds for any purposes may not be recovered from ratepayers
without Commission approval in a future application for rate recovery” and that the Utility “bears the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of any
expenditure.”

66

Pre-petition Debt and Equity Financings

There were no issuances under the PG&E Corporation February 2017 equity distribution agreement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

During 2018, PG&E Corporation issued 5.6 million shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $199 million under the PG&E Corporation 401(k) plan and
share-based compensation plans. The proceeds from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. Beginning January 1, 2019, PG&E Corporation's
matching contributions under its 401(k) plan are deposited in cash.

During the first quarter of 2018, the Utility satisfied and discharged its remaining obligation of $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Notes
due October 15, 2018.

In February 2018, the Utility’s $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in February 2017, matured and was repaid. In February 2018, the Utility
entered into a new $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of
the Utility’s outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility's obligation to repay this loan, which was scheduled to mature on
February 22, 2019, has been stayed.

In April 2018, PG&E Corporation entered into a $350 million floating rate unsecured term loan. The term loan was scheduled to mature on April 16, 2020. As a
result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation's obligation to repay this loan has been stayed. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes,
including the early redemption of PG&E Corporation’s outstanding $350 million principal amount of 2.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2019. On April 26, 2018,
PG&E Corporation completed the early redemption of these bonds, which satisfied and discharged its remaining obligation of $350 million.

In August 2018, the Utility issued $500 million principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due August 1, 2023 and $300 million principal amount of 4.65% senior
notes due August 1, 2028. The proceeds were used to repay $500 million floating rate Senior Notes due November 28, 2018 and for general corporate purposes.

In November 2018, the Utility’s $500 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in November 2017, matured and was repaid.

In December 2018, the Utility’s $45 million principal amount of 1.05% Series 2008 G pollution control bonds matured and were repaid.

In November 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility drew all amounts available under their respective revolving credit facilities in the amount of $300 million
and $2.85 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had aggregate borrowings outstanding under their respective revolving
credit facilities of $300 million and $2.965 billion, respectively.  The Utility’s aggregate borrowings under its revolving credit facility includes $2.85 billion of
revolving credit loans, and approximately $80 million of letters of credit outstanding.  See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Dividends

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,
due to the uncertainty related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

(215)

The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as
depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1.2 billion compared to 2017.  This decrease
was due to an increase in costs for clean-up and repair, and legal and other costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, as well as
enhanced vegetation management work, and due to fluctuations in activities within the normal course of business such as the timing and amount of customer
billings and collections and vendor billings and payments. Additionally, the Utility paid $59 million in income taxes in 2018, as compared to receiving a refund of
$162 million in 2017.

During 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.6 billion compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to additional electric and
natural gas operating revenues collected as authorized by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&S rate case, the $400 million refund to natural gas customers in the second
quarter of 2016, as required by the San Bruno Penalty Decision (with no corresponding activity in 2017), and the receipt of approximately $300 million of
insurance recoveries related to the 2015 Butte fire in 2017 as compared to $50 million of insurance recoveries related to the 2015 Butte fire during 2016.

The Utility will continue to operate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.  Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various ongoing
activities, including:

•

•

•

•

•

the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, and
regulatory matters (see Note 13 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. and
Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information);

the timing and amount of premium payments related to wildfire insurance (see “Wildfire Insurance” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 for more information);

the Tax Act, which may accelerate the timing of federal tax payments and reduce revenue requirements, resulting in lower operating cash flows
depending on the timing of wildfire payments (see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters”
below for more information);

the timing and outcomes of the 2019 GT&S rate case, 2020 GRC, FERC TO18, TO19 and TO20 rate cases, 2018 CEMA filing, 2020 Cost of Capital,
NDCTP, and other ratemaking and regulatory proceedings; and

the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan (see “Overview” above and “Regulatory
Matters” below for more information).

68

The Utility had material obligations outstanding as of the Petition Date, including claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires.
Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Future cash flows will be materially impacted by the timing and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $ 914 million during 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase of approximately $873 million in
capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in capital
expenditures. The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable
electricity and natural gas services to its customers.  Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust
investments which are largely offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust investments.  The funds in the decommissioning
trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur
approximately $7.1 billion in capital expenditures in 2019, and $6.9 billion in 2020.

Financing Activities

During 2018, net cash provided by financing activities increased by $ 2.6 billion as compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to borrowings under
revolving credit facilities.

Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating
activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date of existing debt instruments.  The
Utility generally utilizes long-term debt issuances, retained earnings, and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital
structure, and relies on short-term debt to fund temporary financing needs.

(1) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at December 31, 2018 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms

ending at each instrument’s maturity. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event under the long term debt summarized in the table
above. For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations” in Item 7. MD&A and Note 4 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

(2) See “Purchase Commitments” and “Other Commitments” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
(3) See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As these

annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the amount shown in the column entitled “more than 5 years” represents only 1 year of contributions for the Utility’s pension and
other benefit plans.

(4) Beginning with the three-month period ending January 31, 2018, quarterly cash dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock were suspended.  While the timing of cumulative dividend payments
is uncertain, it is assumed for the table above to be payable within a fixed period of five years based on historical performance.  (See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8.)

The contractual commitments table above excludes potential payments associated with unrecognized tax positions.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding tax audits,
PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot make reliable estimates of the amounts and periods of future payments to major tax jurisdictions related to unrecognized
tax benefits.  Matters relating to tax years that remain subject to examination are discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8. (For more information, see “Liquidity and Financial Resources - Financial Resources - Acceleration of Pre-petition Debt Obligations” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assign or reject certain executory contracts and
unexpired leases, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and satisfaction of certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or
unexpired lease is treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves PG&E Corporation and
the Utility of performing their respective future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease will
require PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, to cure existing monetary and non-monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and

provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease with PG&E Corporation or the Utility
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including where applicable a quantification of the obligations under any such executory contract or unexpired lease, is
qualified by any overriding assumption or rejection rights PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, has under the Bankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein
is or shall be deemed to be an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease
and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expressly reserve all of their rights with respect thereto.

69

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate if they will seek to assume or reject any power
purchase agreement in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. Any decision to assume or reject any power purchase agreement will be made by PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s management in consideration of then-existing economic, regulatory, market and legal conditions and other relevant considerations,
subject to the Bankruptcy Court and potentially other approvals.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material
effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources,
other than those discussed under "Purchase Commitments" in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION MATTERS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation
matters described in Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. and Legal Proceedings in Item 3. The outcome of these
matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.

REGULATORY MATTERS

The Utility is subject to substantial regulation by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC, and other federal and state regulatory agencies. The resolutions of the
proceedings described below and other proceedings may materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and cash flows.

2017 General Rate Case

On May 11, 2017, the CPUC issued a final decision in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, which determined the annual amount of base revenues (or “revenue requirements”)
that the Utility is authorized to collect from customers from 2017 through 2019 to recover its anticipated costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and
electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. The final decision approved, with certain modifications,
the settlement agreement that the Utility, PAO, TURN, and 12 other intervening parties jointly submitted to the CPUC on August 3, 2016. Consistent with the
amounts proposed in the settlement agreement, the final decision approved a revenue requirement increase of $88 million for 2017, with additional increases of
$444 million in 2018 and $361 million in 2019.

On September 24, 2018, the CPUC approved the Utility's advice letter proposal to make a one-time reduction to revenues by approximately $21 million. This
advice letter was directed by an ALJ ruling in response to the Utility's $300 million expense reduction announcement in January 2017.

Also, as a result of the Tax Act, on March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC’s final decision in the 2017 GRC. The PFM, if adopted,
would reduce revenue requirements by $267 million and $296 million for 2018 and 2019 respectively, and increase rate base by $199 million and $425 million for
2018 and 2019, respectively. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of this PFM.

70

The Utility provided an update of the cost effectiveness study for the SmartMeter TM Upgrade project to the CPUC on July 10, 2017. On January 31, 2019, the
CPUC extended the statutory deadline for the 2017 GRC to August 9, 2019, in order to allow for comments and CPUC action on any PD on the SmartMeter TM
upgrade cost effectiveness study. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of any CPUC action in connection with this study and its impact on the 2017
GRC revenue requirement and rate base.

2020 General Rate Case

On December 13, 2018, the Utility filed its 2020 GRC application with the CPUC. In the 2020 GRC, the Utility has requested that the CPUC determine the annual
amount of base revenues (or "revenue requirements") that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2020 through 2022 to recover its anticipated
costs for electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and electric generation operations and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of
return. The Utility's request also reflects an updated capital forecast for 2018 and 2019. The 2020 GRC application also includes recorded costs for 2017 and
updated forecasts for the proposed mitigations for the period 2018 through 2022 for the Utility's top safety-related risks as presented in the Utility's November
2017 RAMP report.

For 2020, the Utility has requested base revenues of $9.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 12.4%, as compared to authorized base revenues for 2019. The
requested weighted average rate base for 2020 is approximately $30 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $2.7 billion over the 2019 authorized rate base of
$27.3 billion. The Utility also requested that the CPUC establish a ratemaking mechanism that would increase the Utility's authorized revenues in 2021 and 2022
by $454 million and $486 million, respectively. Over the 2020-2022 GRC period, the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately
$4.5 billion in electric distribution, natural gas distribution and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.

The following tables compare the requested 2020 revenue requirement amounts with the comparable revenue requirements currently authorized for 2019, by both

(1) The Utility's GRC forecast indicates that future liability insurance premium costs will be approximately $355 million in 2020

Among other things, the Utility proposes to invest a total of approximately $5 billion (including approximately $3 billion for capital expenditures) between 2018
and 2022 on CWSP measures. Through this program, the Utility proposes to bolster wildfire prevention, risk monitoring, emergency response efforts, and add new
and enhanced safety measures, increase vegetation management and harden its electric system to help further reduce wildfire risks.

In addition, the Utility requests authorization to establish several new balancing accounts, including:

•

•

a two-way electric and gas Risk Transfer Balancing Account to record the difference between the amounts adopted for liability insurance premiums and
the Utility's actual costs; this two-way account would allow the Utility to pass-through actual insurance costs for up to $2 billion in coverage and return to
customers any overcollection if forecast costs exceed actuals costs; and

a two-way Wildfire Safety Balancing Account to track and record actual incremental expenses and capital revenue requirements associated with the
incremental costs of fire risk mitigation work that are not already addressed and recorded in another account; this would include the costs associated with
overhead system hardening, enhanced vegetation management, and other incremental costs of wildfire mitigations that are approved by the CPUC in the
Utility's annual wildfire mitigation plan. In accordance with SB 901, the Utility submitted its first Wildfire Safety Plan to the CPUC on February 6, 2019.

This GRC proposal does not request funding for potential lawsuits or claims resulting from the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. Also, the
Utility is not seeking recovery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases may impact the amount of
work the Utility can commit to financing and require a change to the scope of work that the Utility proposes to accomplish in the 2020 GRC period.

In its application, the Utility requests that the CPUC issue a final decision by March 2020 and that the 2020 GRC rates be effective January 1, 2020. The
prehearing conference was held February 11, 2019, to set a procedural schedule, including the dates for interested parties to submit testimony and for evidentiary
hearings.

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case

In its final decisions in the Utility's 2015 GT&S rate case, the CPUC excluded from rate base $696 million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014. This was the
amount recorded in excess of the amount adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered that
the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding. The
Utility would be required to take a charge in the future if the CPUC’s audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance.
The audit is still in process. The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the audit.

As a result of the Tax Act, on March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC a PFM of the CPUC's final decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case proposing to
reduce revenue requirements by $58 million and increase rate base by $12 million for 2018 (excluding the impacts of an approximately $7 million increase in
revenue requirement and a $60 million increase in rate base associated with the Utility's private letter ruling advice letter approved by the CPUC on July 18, 2018).
The Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of this PFM.

72

2019 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case

On November 17, 2017, the Utility filed its 2019 GT&S rate case application with the CPUC for the years 2019 through 2021. The Utility also provided a revenue
requirement and rates for 2022, in the event the CPUC adopts an additional year. On October 1, 2018, the Utility entered into a stipulation with PAO that, if
approved, would extend the rate case cycle through 2022 as recommended by PAO.

In its application, the Utility requested that the CPUC authorize a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.59 billion to recover anticipated costs of providing natural gas
transmission and storage services beginning on January 1, 2019. This corresponds to an increase of $289 million over the Utility’s 2018 authorized revenue
requirement of $1.30 billion. The Utility’s request also proposed revenue requirements of $1.73 billion for 2020, $1.91 billion for 2021, and $1.91 billion for 2022
if the CPUC orders a fourth year for the rate case period.

The Utility subsequently revised its forecast revenue requirement as a result of the Tax Act and other forecast updates, including significant reductions in the areas
of gas storage facilities and gas system operations programs. The revised revenue requirements are as follows: $1.48 billion for 2019, $1.59 billion for 2020, $1.69
billion for 2021, and $1.68 billion for 2022. The revised 2019 requested revenue requirement corresponds to an increase of $184 million over the Utility's 2018
authorized revenue requirement.

The requested rate base for 2019 is $4.75 billion, which corresponds to an increase of $1.04 billion over the 2018 adopted rate base of $3.71 billion. The Utility’s
request is based on capital expenditure forecasts of $829 million for 2019, $872 million for 2020, and $825 million for 2021 (which exclude common capital
allocations). The requested rate base amounts exclude approximately $576 million of capital spending subject to audit by the CPUC related to 2011 through 2014
expenditures in excess of amounts adopted in the 2011 GT&S rate case. The Utility is unable to predict whether the $576 million, or a portion thereof, will
ultimately be approved by the CPUC and included in the Utility’s future rate base.

The requested increase in revenue requirement is largely attributable to increased infrastructure investment and costs related to new natural gas storage safety and
environmental regulations issued by DOGGR, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the CPUC.

In response to the Utility's application, parties proposed various forecast reductions. For example, the PAO recommended a 2019 revenue requirement of $1.35
billion, an increase of $45 million over 2018 adopted amounts. TURN proposed widespread reductions in forecast costs and recommended capital and expense
disallowances of more than $500 million.

A later phase of the proceeding is expected to address the removal of officer compensation costs from the revenue requirement, which is required by SB 901. The
Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.

Transmission Owner Rate Cases

Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)

On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases that had
granted the Utility a 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. Those rate case decisions have been remanded to FERC for
further proceedings consistent with the Court of Appeals’ opinion. If FERC concludes on remand that the Utility should no longer be authorized to receive the 50
basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively. Alternatively, if
FERC again concludes that the Utility should receive the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder and provides the additional explanation that the Ninth Circuit found
the FERC’s prior decisions lacked, then the Utility would not owe any refunds for this issue for TO16 or TO17.

On February 28, 2018, the Utility filed a motion to establish procedures on remand requesting a hearing and additional briefing on the issues identified in the Ninth
Circuit Court's opinion. On August 20, 2018, FERC issued an order granting the Utility's motion to allow for additional briefing. The order also consolidated the
TO18 rate case with TO16 and TO17 for this issue. The Utility filed briefs on September 19, 2018 and reply briefs on October 10, 2018. The Utility is unable to
predict the timing and outcome of FERC’s decision.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)

On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a $387
million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7 billion.  The Utility is
seeking a return on equity of 10.9%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the
filing, the Utility forecasted that it would make investments of $1.30 billion in 2017 in various capital projects.

On September 30, 2016, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2016 filing and set it for hearing, but held the hearing procedures in abeyance for
settlement procedures.  The order set an effective date for rates of March 1, 2017, and made the rates subject to refund following resolution of the case.  On March
17, 2017, the FERC issued an order terminating the settlement procedures due to an impasse in the settlement negotiations reported by the parties.  During the
hearings held in January 2018, the Utility, intervenors, and the FERC trial staff, addressed questions relating to return on equity, capital structure, depreciation
rates, capital additions, rate base, operating and maintenance expense, administrative and general expense, and the allocation of common, general and intangible
costs.

On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial decision in the TO18 rate case proposing an ROE of 9.13% compared to the Utility’s request of 10.90%, and an
estimated composite depreciation rate of 2.96% compared to the Utility’s request of 3.25%. The ALJ also rejected the Utility's method of allocating common plant
between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction. In addition, the ALJ proposed to reduce forecasted capital and expense spending to actual costs incurred for the rate case
period. Further, the ALJ proposed to remove certain items from the Utility's rate base and revenue requirement. The Utility and intervenors filed initial briefs on
October 31, 2018, and reply briefs on November 20, 2018, in response to the ALJ's recommendations. The Utility expects FERC to issue a decision in mid-2019,
but expects one or more parties to seek rehearing of that decision and then appeal it to the courts. The Utility is unable to predict the timing of when a final decision
will be issued.

Additionally, on March 31, 2017, intervenors in the TO18 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increase
in the TO18 rate case. On November 16, 2017, the FERC dismissed the complaint. On December 18, 2017, the complainants filed a request for a rehearing of that
order, which the FERC denied on May 17, 2018.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)

On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case at the FERC requesting a 2018 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.79 billion, a $74 million
increase over the proposed 2017 revenue requirement of $1.72 billion. The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2018 is $6.9 billion.  The Utility is
seeking an ROE of 10.75%, which includes an incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.  In the filing, the
Utility forecasted capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion.  On September 28, 2017, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s July 2017 filing,
subject to hearing and refund, and established March 1, 2018, as the effective date for rate changes.  FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance
pending settlement discussion among the parties. On May 14, 2018, the Utility filed a proposal to reflect the impact of the Tax Act on its TO tariff rates effective
March 1, 2018, in the resolution of the TO19 rate case. The tax impact reduces the TO19 requested revenue requirement from $1.79 billion to $1.66 billion.

74

On September 29, 2017, intervenors in the TO19 rate case filed a complaint at the FERC alleging that the Utility failed to justify its proposed rate increase in the
TO19 rate case. On October 17, 2017, the Utility requested that the FERC dismiss the complaint. On May 17, 2018, the FERC issued an order setting the
complaint for hearing, settlement judge procedures, and consolidation with the TO19 proceeding.

On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party settlement with FERC in connection with TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will
be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined in the TO18 final decision. Additionally, if FERC determines that the Utility is not
entitled to the 50 basis point incentive adder for the Utility's continued CAISO participation, than the Utility would be obligated to make a refund to customers of
approximately $25 million. On December 20, 2018, FERC issued an order approving the all-party settlement.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)

On October 1, 2018, the Utility filed its TO20 rate case at FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with the Utility's electric
transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility's October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and refund, and
established May 1, 2019, as the effective date for rate changes. FERC also ordered that the hearings will be held in abeyance pending settlement discussions among
the parties. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of settlement discussions.

The formula rate replaces the "stated rate" methodology that the Utility used in its previous TO rate case filings. The formula rate methodology still includes an
authorized revenue requirement and rate base for a given year, but it also provides for an annual update of the following year's revenue requirement and rates in
accordance with the terms of the FERC-approved formula. Under the formula rate mechanism, transmission revenues, including CWIP, will be updated to the
actual cost of service annually. Differences between amounts collected and determined under the formula rate will be either collected from or refunded to
customers.

In the filing, the Utility forecasts a 2019 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.96 billion. The proposed amount reflects an approximately 9.5%
increase over the as-filed TO19 requested revenue requirement of $1.79 billion (a subsequent reduction to $1.66 billion was identified as a result of the Tax Act).
The Utility forecasts that it will make investments of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion for 2018 and 2019, respectively, for various capital projects to be
placed in service before the end of 2019. Including projects to be placed in service beyond 2019, the Utility forecasts total electric transmission capital
expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018 and $1.4 billion in 2019. The Utility's forecasted rate base for 2019 is approximately $8 billion on a weighted average basis,
compared to the Utility's forecasted rate base of $6.9 billion in 2018. The Utility has requested that FERC approve a 12.5% return on equity (which includes an
incentive component of 50 basis points for the Utility's continuing participation in the CAISO), an increase from the 10.75% (also inclusive of a 50 basis point
CAISO incentive adder) requested in its TO19 rate case. A settlement conference is scheduled for March 14 - 15, 2019.

The Utility expects to file an annual update to its TO tariff on or before December 1 of each year beginning in 2019, for rates and charges to become effective
January 1 of the following year, consistent with the formula rate.

Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding

The Utility expects that the decommissioning of Diablo Canyon will take many years after the expiration of its current operating licenses. Detailed studies of the
cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are conducted every three years in conjunction with the NDCTP. Actual decommissioning costs
may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment. The
Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until
those costs are fully recovered.

On December 13, 2018, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning cost estimate to the CPUC for Diablo Canyon based on a site-specific decommissioning
analysis. A prehearing conference was held on February 6, 2019.

Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account

On June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Utility’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective as
of July 26, 2017. In the WEMA, the Utility can record costs related to wildfires, including: (1) payments to satisfy wildfire claims, including any deductibles, co-
insurance and other insurance expense paid by the Utility but excluding costs that have already been forecasted and adopted in the Utility’s GRC; (2) outside legal
costs incurred in the defense of wildfire claims; (3) insurance premium costs not in rates; and (4) the cost of financing these amounts.  Insurance proceeds, as well
as any payments received from third parties, or through FERC authorized rates, will be credited to the WEMA as they are received.  The WEMA will not include
the Utility’s costs for fire response and infrastructure costs which are tracked in the CEMA.  The decision does not grant the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-
related costs. Any such rate recovery would require CPUC authorization in a separate proceeding. (See Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.)

As of December 31, 2018, the Consolidated Financial Statements include long-term regulatory assets of $94 million , consisting of insurance premium costs that
are probable of recovery. Should PG&E Corporation and the Utility conclude in future periods that recovery of insurance premiums in excess of amounts included
in authorized revenue requirements is no longer probable, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will record a charge in the period such conclusion is reached.

Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Applications

The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency
by competent federal or state authorities through a CEMA. In 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetation
management work in response to the severe drought in California. The costs associated with this work are tracked in the CEMA. While the Utility believes such
costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA applications are subject to CPUC review and approval. For more information see Note 3 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

2016 CEMA Application

In 2016, the Utility submitted a request to the CPUC to authorize recovery under the CEMA tariff for a revenue requirement increase of approximately $146
million for recorded capital and expense costs related to the 2015 drought mitigations and emergency response activities for declared disasters that occurred from
December 2012 through March 2016. On January 4, 2018, PAO, TURN, and the Utility filed an all-party motion with the CPUC seeking approval of an all-party
settlement agreement. The settlement agreement proposed that the Utility’s total CEMA revenue requirement request be reduced by $29 million, from $146 million
to $117 million. On June 21, 2018, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement authorizing the Utility to recover $117 million in connection with its 2016
CEMA application.

2018 CEMA Application

On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophic
events that included fire and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017
to cut back or remove dead or dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. Also, the 2018 CEMA application originally
sought cost recovery of $555 million on a forecast basis, subject to true-up if actual costs were greater or less than the forecast, for additional tree mortality and fire
risk mitigation work anticipated in 2018 and 2019. On October 12, 2018, the Utility notified the CPUC and other parties that $180 million of the forecasted 2018
and 2019 fire risk mitigation costs would be removed from CEMA and instead pursued in the FHPMA. Upon removal of the $180 million, the Utility's forecast of
costs for 2018 and 2019 sought in the application would be approximately $375 million. The 2018 CEMA application does not include costs related to the 2015
Butte fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, or the 2018 Camp fire.

76

On November 2, 2018, the assigned ALJ denied the Utility's July 25, 2018 motion requesting interim rate relief for $441 million, which represents 75% of the costs
incurred in 2016 and 2017 related to storms, wildfires and tree mortality response work. Subsequently, on December 4, 2018, the Utility filed a renewed motion for
interim rate relief, due to worsening financial conditions. The renewed motion for interim relief sought approximately $588 million, which represents 100% of the
total costs incurred in 2016 and 2017 for the activities referenced above. The Utility requested that the interim rate relief begins on March 1, 2019 and cost
recovery occurs over a one-year period, with the amounts collected to be subject to refund based on the authorized amount in the proceeding.

On February 5, 2019, the assigned ALJs issued a PD on the Utility's renewed motion for interim rate relief, granting interim rate recovery “in an amount no greater
than and possibly less than $373 million” of its recorded 2016 and 2017 CEMA costs, as compared to approximately $588 million requested by the Utility, subject
to ensuring that the overall impact would result in no rate increase as compared to revenue at present rates. If adopted, the PD would also require the Utility to
refund, with interest, any excess rate recovery amount it obtained in comparison to the final decision in this proceeding regarding the total approved 2016 and 2017
CEMA costs. Further, the PD rejected the Utility’s $555 million cost recovery request, on a forecast basis, for 2018 and 2019 anticipated costs for tree mortality
and fire risk mitigation work. The PD finds, among other things, that the applicable CPUC resolution does not authorize recovery of CEMA eligible costs on a
forecast basis. The Utility expects that the CPUC will vote on the PD no earlier than March 14, 2019.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.

Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account

The CPUC allows utilities to track and record costs associated with the implementation of regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential
fire hazards associated with overhead power line facilities and nearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in another
proceeding. The Utility currently is authorized to track such costs in the FHPMA through the end of 2019. During 2018, the Utility recorded $262 million of costs
to the FHPMA, corresponding to vegetation management work performed to comply with CPUC December 2017 fire safety regulations. While the Utility believes
such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in a separate proceeding or through a GRC. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Other Regulatory Proceedings

2019 Wildfire Safety Plan

On October 25, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to implement the provisions of SB 901 related to electric utility wildfire mitigation plans. This OIR provided
guidance on the form and content of the initial wildfire mitigation plans, provided a venue for review of the initial plans, and developed and refined the content of
and process for review and implementation of wildfire mitigation plans to be filed in future years. In this proceeding the CPUC will consider, among other things,
how to interpret and apply SB 901’s list of required plan elements, as well as whether additional elements beyond those required in SB 901 should be included in
the wildfire mitigation plans. SB 901 also requires, among other things, that such plans include a description of the preventive strategies and programs to be
adopted by an electrical corporation to minimize the risk of its electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires, including the consideration of dynamic
climate change risks, plans for vegetation management, and plans for inspections of the electrical corporation’s electrical infrastructure. The scope of this
proceeding does not include utility recovery of costs related to wildfire mitigation plans, which SB 901 requires be addressed in separate rate recovery applications.

On February 6, 2019, the Utility filed its wildfire mitigation plan with the CPUC. The 2019 Wildfire Safety Plan also describes forecasted work and investments in
2019 that are designed to help further reduce the potential for wildfire ignitions associated with the Utility’s electrical equipment in high fire-threat areas. The 2019
Wildfire Safety Plan specifically addresses wildfire risk factors that occur most frequently and have potential to start or spread a fire. The new and ongoing safety
measures being pursued include:

•

•

Installing nearly 600 new, high-definition cameras, made available to Cal Fire and local fire officials, in high fire-threat areas by 2022, increasing
coverage across high fire-threat areas to more than 90%;

Adding approximately 1,300 additional new weather stations by 2022, at a density of one station roughly every 20 circuit miles in high fire-threat areas;

77

•

•

•

•

•

Conducting enhanced safety inspections of electric infrastructure in high-fire threat areas, including approximately 735,000 electric towers and poles
across approximately 5,700 transmission line miles and 25,200 distribution line miles;

Further enhancing vegetation management efforts across high and extreme fire-threat areas to address vegetation that poses higher potential for wildfire
risk, such as removing or trimming trees from particular 'at-risk' tree species that have exhibited a higher pattern of failing;

Continuing to disable automatic reclosing in high fire-threat areas during wildfire season and periods of high fire-risk and upgrading more reclosers and
circuit breakers in high fire-threat areas with remote control capabilities

Installing stronger and more resilient poles and covered power lines, including targeted undergrounding, starting in areas with the highest fire risk,
ultimately upgrading and strengthening approximately 7,100 miles over the next 10 years; and

Partnering with additional communities in high fire-threat areas to create new resilience zones that can power central community resources during a
Public Safety Power Shutoff.

The CPUC is expected to issue a decision in the second quarter of 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

OIR to Implement Public Utilities Code Section 451.2 Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in
the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide
adequate and safe service (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the
issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017
Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018
Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.

78

On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer
Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code. In the OIR, the CPUC stated that “consistent with Section 451.2(a), the
determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the recovery of specific costs related to the 2017
wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that any securitization of costs
relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires,
(b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the
Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017
Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the
position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take several years to obtain authorization to securitize any amounts
relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.

On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUC
should (1) promptly set a Customer Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity to
enable PG&E Corporation and the Utility and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capital
needed to resolve claims arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) define
how the Customer Harm Threshold will be applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&E
Corporation and the Utility can raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up to
approximately $3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.

Transportation Electrification

California Law SB 350 requires the CPUC, in consultation with the California Air Resources Board and the CEC, to direct electrical corporations to file
applications for programs and investments to accelerate widespread TE. In September 2016, the CPUC directed the Utility and the other large IOUs to file TE
applications that include both short-term projects (of up to $20 million in total) and two-to-five year programs with a requested revenue requirement determined by
the Utility.

On May 31, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the Utility’s standard review program proposals for actual expenditures up to approximately $269
million (including $198 million of capital expenditures), to support make-ready infrastructure supporting public fast charging and medium to heavy-duty fleets. In
the FleetReady program, the Utility has a goal of providing utility-owned make-ready infrastructure at 700 sites, conducting operation and maintenance of installed
infrastructure, and educating customers on the benefits of electric vehicles. The final decision gives customers the option of self-funding, installing, owning, and
maintaining the make-ready infrastructure installed beyond the customer meter in lieu of utility ownership, after which they would receive a utility rebate for a
portion of those costs. The Fast Charge program has a goal to install make-ready infrastructure at approximately 52 public charging sites amounting to roughly 234
DC fast chargers.

On December 19, 2018, the CPUC initiated a new Rulemaking for vehicle electrification matters (R. 18-12-006). This new proceeding will include issues related to
utility rate designs supporting transportation electrification and hydrogen fueling stations, a framework for IOUs' transportation electrification investments, and
vehicle-grid integration. A pre-hearing conference for this rulemaking is expected in the first quarter of 2019, with a scoping memo to follow that conference.

Electric Distribution Resources Plan

As required by California law, on July 1, 2015, the Utility filed its proposed electric DRP for approval by the CPUC.  The Utility’s DRP identifies its approach for
identifying optimal locations on its electric distribution system for deployment of DERs.  The Utility’s DRP approach is designed to allow distributed energy
technologies to be integrated into the larger grid while continuing to provide customers with safe, reliable, and affordable electric service.

79

As part of the Utility’s DRP approach, on June 1, 2018, the Utility filed its first annual distribution grid needs assessment report with the CPUC, and on September
4, 2018, the Utility filed its first distribution deferral opportunity report. The distribution deferral report proposes cost effective electric distribution investments
that can be deferred through deployment of dispatchable third-party owned DERs, or non-wire alternative solutions, to operate during specific grid events.  The
Utility convened a distribution planning advisory group comprised of CPUC staff, ratepayer and environmental advocates, and DER market participants, to review
and provide advisory input to the Utility on its distribution deferral identification process and to identify distribution deferral opportunities.  After incorporating the
advisory group’s input, on November 28, 2018, the Utility filed a proposal with the CPUC for competitively procuring distribution services from third-party owned
DERs to defer selected distribution deferral opportunities.  The Utility expects to launch competitive solicitations following the CPUC’s approval of the Utility’s
procurement plan.

On March 26, 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision requiring the Utility to include a grid modernization plan for integrating DERs in the Utility's GRC.  The
grid modernization plan for DERs must include a narrative 10-year vision for investments needed to support DER growth, while ensuring safety and service
reliability.  On June 25, 2018, the Utility hosted a public grid modernization workshop for integrating DERs to provide a high-level overview of its vision and 10-
year plan and incorporate stakeholder input.  On December 13, 2018, the Utility filed its 2020 GRC Application, which includes the Utility’s grid modernization
vision and plan.

OIR to Consider Strategies and Guidance for Climate Change Adaptation

On April 26, 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR to consider strategies for integrating climate change adaptation matters into relevant CPUC proceedings.  Phase one
will focus on how to integrate climate change adaptation into the IOUs’ existing planning and operations to ensure utility safety and reliability.

The CPUC OIR will consider:

•

•

•

•

how to define climate change adaption for the IOUs;

the climate-driven risks facing the IOUs;

data, tools, resources, and guidance to instruct utilities on how to incorporate adaption in their existing planning and operational processes; and

strategies to address climate change in CPUC proceedings, including impacts on disadvantaged communities.

On October 10, 2018, the CPUC issued a scoping memo and established a procedural schedule. A final decision is expected in late 2019.

80

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES

Senate Bill 901

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a Customer Harm Threshold (as defined herein), directing the CPUC to limit
certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that
permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the
CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with
respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.

On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer
Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC stated
that “consistent with Section 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the
recovery of specific costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Based on the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims
relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such
costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the
Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and
precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take several years to obtain
authorization to securitize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.

On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR. (See “Regulatory Matters - OIR to Implement Public
Utilities Code Section 451.2 Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901” above.)

In addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC.  The
wildfire mitigation plan must include the components specified in SB 901, such as identification and prioritization of wildfire risks, and drivers for those risks;
plans for vegetation management; actions to harden the system, prepare for, and respond to events; and protocols for disabling reclosers and deenergizing the
system.  The CPUC has three months to approve a utility’s plan, with the ability to extend the deadline.  The CPUC will conduct an annual compliance review,
which will be supported by an independent evaluator’s report.  The CPUC will complete the compliance review within 18 months.  SB 901 establishes factors to be
considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan.  Costs associated with the wildfire mitigation plan are tracked in a
memorandum account, and the costs of implementing the plan will be assessed in each utility’s General Rate Case proceeding, or other application proceedings.
The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the CPUC’s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire
mitigation plan implementation, or the timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities.

Finally, SB 901 established a Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, a
potential state wildfire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The commission, which will be composed of members with demonstrated expertise
in insurance, public and private utilities, or allocation of costs and reduction of damage associated with wildfires, will hold multiple meetings throughout the state
to accept public and expert testimony and develop recommendations. The commission, in consultation with the CPUC and California Insurance Commissioner,
will prepare a report on or before July 1, 2019, that contains an assessment of issues surrounding catastrophic wildfire costs and damages and makes
recommendations for changes to the law. The recommendations of the commission and the response by the Governor and legislature to those recommendations
could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Power Charge Indifference Adjustment OIR

On October 11, 2018, the CPUC approved a decision to modify the PCIA methodology, which was developed after the 2001 California energy crisis, which adjusts
how customers that leave the Utility's bundled service for CCA or Direct Access service, pay for their share of the costs associated with long-term power purchase
commitments made on their behalf. The decision better enables utilities to recover their above market costs from departing customers as compared to the previous
methodology, by:

•

•

•

•

adopting benchmark values used to set the PCIA rate that more closely resemble actual market prices for resource adequacy and renewable energy credits;

continuing to allow legacy utility-owned generation costs to be recovered from CCA customers;

eliminating the 10-year limit on PCIA cost recovery for post-2002 utility owned generation and certain storage costs; and

adding an annual true-up to the PCIA rate based on market sales.

The Utility anticipates the revised PCIA rate to go into effect as of May 1, 2019.

On December 19, 2018, a prehearing conference was held to initiate phase 2 of the PCIA proceeding, to further develop proposals for future consideration by the
CPUC. On February 1, 2019, the assigned commissioner issued a phase 2 scoping memo and ruling, which sets forth the category, issues, need for hearing,
schedule, and other matters. As indicated in the scoping memo and ruling, phase 2 of this proceeding will primarily rely upon a working group process to further
develop a number of PCIA-related proposals for consideration by the CPUC, which include benchmark true-up for brown power resource adequacy and renewable
energy credits, rate design mechanics, portfolio optimization and cost reduction, allocation and auctions, whether the Commission should consider new or modified
shareholder responsibility for future portfolio mismanagement, if any, and CCA and DA prepayment options. The schedule included in the scoping memo and
ruling indicates that the CPUC is expected to issue decisions on several topics covered by this OIR starting in late 2019 and extending through 2020.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of
the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous
wastes; the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and
reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  (See Item 1A. Risk Factors,
"Environmental Regulation" in Item 1. and "Environmental Remediation Contingencies" in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8.)

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest
rates, and counterparty credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage
unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e.,
risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and
nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of
physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can conclude
that it is probable that its reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural
gas prices will not affect earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers
are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.

82

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected.
The Utility recovers these costs in its gas transmission and storage rate cases through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts,
resulting in price and volumetric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk was
approximately $11 million and $8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8. for further discussion of price risk management activities.)

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market
interest rates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , if interest rates changed by 1% for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt,
and cash investments, the impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $24 million and $12 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt and
other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding. (See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. for further discussion of interest
rates.)

Energy Procurement Credit Risk

The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry, including the CAISO market, other California investor-owned electric utilities,
municipal utilities, energy trading companies, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the
United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas, then the Utility may find it necessary to
procure electricity or gas at current market prices, which may be higher than the contract prices.

The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit
ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contracts
under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security (referred to as “Credit Collateral” in the table below). Credit collateral may be in the form
of cash or letters of credit. The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other
eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility). Credit collateral or performance assurance may be required from counterparties when current net
receivables and replacement cost exposure exceed contractually specified limits.

The following table summarizes the Utility’s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The
accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting policies due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and
material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments
and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting policies and their key characteristics are outlined
below.

Loss Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, and
environmental remediation liabilities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.

Wildfire-Related liabilities

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability when
it determines that a loss is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless an
amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.

Potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of each
fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,
the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,
other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There
are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that
may be asserted against PG&E Corporation or the Utility, the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current
and future claims that will be included in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and
whether such claims will be allowed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the
Chapter 11 Cases.

The process for estimating wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective
factors, including but not limited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  (See Note
13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

84

Enforcement and Litigation Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and
lawsuits. In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a
provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a
better estimate than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable,
often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all
known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a
particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actual
results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. (See Note 13 and “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to pay
for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous
substances at various potential sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the
storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential
site requiring remedial action. (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation
with regulatory agencies. For example, the Utility has begun a program related to certain former manufactured gas plant sites.) Based on such notification, the
Utility completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records an
environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.
Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for
estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of
hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on
the level of information available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are
expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions,
operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.
Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may
change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.

85

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. The
Utility’s undiscounted future costs could increase to as much as $ 2.5 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if
the other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs, and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond
regulatory requirements. Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may
vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.

Insurance Receivable

The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. The Utility records insurance recoveries only when a
third-party claim is recorded and it is deemed probable that a recovery of that claim will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The
assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of
complex judgments about future events.  Insurance recoveries are reviewed quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information,
including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, discussions with insurers and other
information and events pertaining to a particular matter. (See "Loss Recoveries" in Note 13 and “Other Matters” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.)

Regulatory Accounting

As a regulated entity, the Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despite
the ongoing losses related to wildfires (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), there is no actual or anticipated change in the cost of
service regulation of the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated
Operations
. These amounts would
otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. At December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatory
balancing accounts receivable) of $6.6 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $10.1 billion .

86

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory
hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of the
Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the
CPUC. The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of
incurred costs is probable, such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on
reacquired debt. The CPUC has not denied the recovery of any material costs previously recognized by the Utility as regulatory assets for the periods presented. If
the Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rate
regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accounting did not apply, the
Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue
recognition.

A portion of the Utility's regulatory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from
catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a
memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently
incurred. These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, and FHPMA, among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to
disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. While the Utility believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC
authorization in separate proceedings or through a GRC. (For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account”, “Regulatory
Matters - Catastrophic Expense Memorandum Account”, and “Regulatory Matters - Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account” in Item 7. MD&A.)

Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanism for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-related
costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold.
Through December 31, 2018, the Utility has incurred net wildfire-related claims for the 2017 Northern California wildfires in excess of $2.7 billion. The Utility has
made an assessment as of December 31, 2018 and has concluded that the net wildfire-related claims do not meet the criteria for recognition as a regulatory asset.
The Utility must evaluate the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period. If the criteria are met at a later date, the Utility would recognize a regulatory asset
and a related gain in the consolidated income statement in the period in which it is determined that the likelihood of recovery is probable.

In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking
purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding
probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected
to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in
third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.

Asset Retirement Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
and its settlement date can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered
through the ratemaking process. (See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs,
inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk
associated with the decommissioning obligation.

87

At December 31, 2018, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $6 billion . Changes in these
estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement health
care and medical plans for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and
retirees. Adjustments to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amounts
are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expense
recognized in accordance with GAAP and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable of
recovery from customers. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarial
assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care
cost trend rate and the expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.
While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or
amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future plan
expenses. (See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

In establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluation
suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design
of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2019 is 6.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% in 2027 and beyond.

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of
the employee benefit trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Fixed-income returns were projected based on real maturity and credit
spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. Equity returns were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term rate
of inflation. For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.0% compares to a ten-year actual return of 10.0%.

The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 1,101 Aa-grade non-callable
bonds at December 31, 2018. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension
and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Organization and Basis of Presentation

PG&E Corporation is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central
California. The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. The Utility is primarily regulated by the
CPUC and the FERC. In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.

This is a combined annual report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&E
Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utility
and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements apply to both PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on a
consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in one segment).

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form
10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the
Utility’s wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, environmental remediation liabilities, insurance receivables, regulatory assets and liabilities,
AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefit plans obligations. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the Consolidated
Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable. A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material
effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which such change
occurred.

Chapter 11 Filing and Going Concern

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as a result of the challenges that are further described below, such
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a
series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018.  See Note 13 below. Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial
doubt about PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's abilities to continue as going concerns.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that commencing
reorganization cases under Chapter 11 is necessary to restore PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial stability to fund ongoing operations and provide safe
service to customers. However, there can be no assurance that such proceedings will restore PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial stability.  On the
Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court.  See Note 15 below.  The
Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should PG&E Corporation and the Utility be unable to continue as
going concerns.

Pursuant to Chapter 11, PG&E Corporation and the Utility retain control of their assets and are authorized to operate their business as debtors in possession while
being subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court. While operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may sell
or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of
business and subject to restrictions in PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's DIP Credit Agreement (see Note 4 and Note 15 below) and applicable orders of the
Bankruptcy Court, for amounts other than those reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  Any such actions occurring during the Chapter
11 Cases confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court could materially impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported in PG&E Corporation's and
the Utility's Consolidated Financial Statements.

108

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Loss Contingencies

A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be
estimated. PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a
charge that reflects their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably
possible, and whether the loss or a range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed
quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes
anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred.

Regulation and Regulated Operations

The Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized
by the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenue
requirements through rates is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assets
and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes and
records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.  Regulatory
assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through
rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future are
also recorded as regulatory liabilities.

The Utility also records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are
probable of recovery or refund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer
billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have no
impact on net income.  See “Revenue Recognition” below.

Management continues to believe the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To the
extent that portions of the Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost of service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes in
regulation or other reasons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy
delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Rates
charged to customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements. Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because of
seasonality, weather, and customer usage patterns.

The FERC authorizes the Utility’s revenue requirements in periodic TO rate cases.  The Utility’s ability to recover revenue requirements authorized by the FERC
is dependent on the volume of the Utility’s electricity sales, and revenue is recognized only for amounts billed and unbilled, net of a reserve for revenues subject to
refund.

Regulatory Balancing Account Revenue

The CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRC and its GT&S rate cases, which generally occur every three or four years.  The Utility
recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within  24
months .  Generally, electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year.

109

The CPUC also has authorized the Utility to collect additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the Utility has been authorized to pass on to customers,
including costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, the
revenue recognition criteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred. The Utility records a regulatory balancing account
asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences
are probable of recovery or refund. As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.

The following table presents the Utility’s revenues disaggregated by type of customer:

(1) This activity is primarily related to the change in unbilled revenue and amounts subject to refund, partially offset by other miscellaneous revenue items.
(2) These amounts represent revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at
fair value.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts to record uncollectable customer accounts receivable at estimated net realizable
value.  The allowance is determined based upon a variety of factors, including historical write-off experience, aging of receivables, current economic conditions,
and assessment of customer collectability.

110

Inventories

Inventories are carried at weighted-average cost and include natural gas stored underground as well as materials and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground is
recorded to inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or to be used as fuel for electric generation.  Materials
and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.

Emission Allowances

The Utility purchases GHG emission allowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in current assets –
other and other noncurrent assets – other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor and
materials, construction overhead, and AFUDC.  (See “AFUDC” below.)  The Utility’s total estimated useful lives and balances of its property, plant, and
equipment were as follows:

(1) Balance includes nuclear fuel inventories.  Stored nuclear fuel inventory is stated at weighted-average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energy

output.  (See Note 14 below.)

The Utility depreciates property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the
gross investment balance in a particular class of property.  This method approximates the straight line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property,
plant, and equipment.  The Utility’s composite depreciation rates were 3.82% in 2018 , 3.83% in 2017 , and 3.73% in 2016 .  The useful lives of the Utility’s
property, plant, and equipment are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers.
Depreciation expense includes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value at
retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and
maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

AFUDC

AFUDC represents the estimated costs of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and is
capitalized as part of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed
in service.  AFUDC related to the cost of debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.  The
Utility recorded AFUDC related to debt and equity, respectively, of $ 53 million and $ 129 million during 2018 , $38 million and $89 million during 2017 , and
$51 million and $112 million during 2016 .

111

Asset Retirement Obligations

$

$

The Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement date
or range of potential settlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirement
activities associated with substations, photovoltaic facilities, and certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain
communications equipment from leased property; and restoration of land to the conditions under certain agreements.

Nuclear Decommissioning Obligation

Detailed studies of the cost to decommission the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities are generally conducted every three years in conjunction with the Nuclear
Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding conducted by the CPUC.  In December 2018, the Utility submitted its updated decommissioning cost estimate to the
CPUC and correspondingly increased its ARO liabilities by $1.1 billion .  The adjustment was a result of increased estimated costs based on a site-specific
decommissioning analysis.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility's nuclear power plants.
Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements;
technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs from customers through a non-
bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.

The total nuclear decommissioning obligation accrued was $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.  The estimated undiscounted
nuclear decommissioning cost for the Utility’s nuclear power plants was $10.6 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

Disallowance of Plant Costs

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not be
recoverable through rates charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.  See “Enforcement and Litigation Matters” in Note 14
below.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts

The Utility’s nuclear generation facilities consist of two units at Diablo Canyon and one retired facility at Humboldt Bay.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the
safe removal of a nuclear generation facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and
release of the property for unrestricted use.  The Utility's nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered from customers through rates and are held in trusts until
authorized for release by the CPUC.

The Utility classifies its debt investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as available-for-sale. Since the Utility’s nuclear decommissioning trust assets
are managed by external investment managers, the Utility does not have the ability to sell its investments at its discretion.  Therefore, all unrealized losses are
considered other-than-temporary impairments. Gains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable or recoverable, respectively, from
customers through rates.  Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on
the Utility’s earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.

112

Variable Interest Entities

A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose
equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary
and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Some of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would
generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2018 , it assessed
whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase
agreement, analyzed the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most
significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights and operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount
the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most
significant to the economic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2018 , it did
not consolidate any of them.

Other Accounting Policies

For other accounting policies impacting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s consolidated financial statements, see “Income Taxes” in Note 8, “Derivatives” in
Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 10, and “Contingencies and Commitments” in Notes 13 and 14 herein.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

Revenue Recognition Standard

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-9,  Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
(Topic
606)
, which amends the previous revenue recognition
guidance.  The objective of the new standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve
comparability across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through
improved and expanded disclosure requirements.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirements using the modified retrospective method when the
ASU became effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of the
adoption date or for the year ended December 31, 2018. A majority of the Utility’s revenue from contracts with customers continues to be recognized on a monthly
basis based on applicable tariffs and customers' monthly consumption. Such revenue is recognized using the invoice practical expedient which allows an entity to
recognize revenue in the amount that directly corresponds to the value transferred to the customer. See "Revenue Recognition" above.

Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  Statement
of
Cash
Flows
–
Restricted
Cash
(Topic
230)
, which amends the existing guidance relating to
the disclosure of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. Amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash
flows.  Previously, changes in restricted cash were reported within cash flows from investing activities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirements
on a retrospective basis when the ASU became effective on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements as of the adoption date or for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The retrospective adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for PG&E Corporation and the Utility resulted in an increase to Net cash used in
investing activities of $227 million, an increase to Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at January 1 by $234 million, and an increase to Cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash at December 31 by $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Post-Retirement Benefit Costs

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07,  Compensation
–
Retirement
Benefits
(Topic
715)
, which amends the guidance relating to the presentation of
net periodic pension cost and net periodic other post-retirement benefit costs.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility applied the requirements when the ASU became
effective on January 1, 2018.

114

On a retrospective basis, the amendment requires an employer to separate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and provides
explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and other components in the income statement.  As a result, the Consolidated Statements of Income
for PG&E Corporation and the Utility were restated. This change resulted in increases to Operating and maintenance expenses and Other income, net, of $51
million and  $54 million for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $97 million and $100 million for PG&E
Corporation and the Utility, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

On a prospective basis, the ASU limits the component of net benefit cost eligible to be capitalized to service costs. The FERC has allowed and the Utility has made
a one-time election to adopt the new FASB guidance for regulatory filing purposes.  In January 2018, the CPUC approved modifications to the Utility’s calculation
for pension-related revenue requirements to allow for capitalization of only the service cost component determined by a plan’s actuary. The capitalization of
service costs only results in higher rate base and a reduction in the Utility’s 2018 revenues.  The changes in capitalization of retirement benefits did not have a
material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments
–
Overall
(Subtopic
825-10):
Recognition
and
Measurement
of
Financial
Assets
and
Financial
Liabilities
, which amends the guidance relating to the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  The amendments
require equity investments (excluding those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value, with changes
in fair value recognized in net income.  The majority of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investments are held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and
gains or losses are refundable or recoverable, respectively, from customers through rates, therefore gains and losses are deferred and recognized as regulatory
assets or liabilities.  The ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related disclosures.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,  Income
Statement
-
Reporting
Comprehensive
Income
(Topic
220):
Reclassification
of
Certain
Tax
Effects
from
Accumulated
Other
Comprehensive
Income
. The amendments in this update allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to
retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. When amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the
Consolidated Statement of Income, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize the related income tax expense at the tax rate in effect at that time. The ASU is
effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. PG&E Corporation and the Utility early adopted this ASU on
January 1, 2018, resulting in an immaterial reclassification.

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic
842)
, which amends the guidance relating to the definition of a lease, recognition of ROU
assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the new standard, all lessees must
recognize an ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet. Operating leases were previously not recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU became effective
for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2019.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility elected certain practical expedients and will carry forward historical conclusions related to (1) contracts that contain leases, (2)
existing lease and easement classification, and (3) initial direct costs. Additionally, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not intend to restate comparative periods
upon adoption.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will apply the requirements using the
modified retrospective method. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect this standard to increase ROU assets and liabilities by approximately $2.5 billion to $3.0
billion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will result in additional footnote disclosures, but do not expect the guidance will have a material impact on the
Consolidated Statements of Income and Statements of Cash Flows. The majority of PG&E Corporation and the Utility's leases are power purchase agreements.

Fair Value Measurement

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13,  Fair
Value
Measurement
(Topic
820):
Disclosure
Framework-Changes
to
the
Disclosure
Requirements
for
Fair
Value
Measurements
, which amends the existing guidance relating to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The ASU will be effective for
PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the
guidance will have on their Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15,  Intangibles-Goodwill

(Subtopic
350-40):

(1) Payments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements. As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the Utility expects to

continuously recover pension benefits.

(2) In connection with the settlement agreement entered into among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC in 2003 to resolve the Utility’s 2001 proceeding under Chapter 11, the CPUC
authorized the Utility to recover $1.2 billion of costs related to the Utility’s retained generation assets.  The individual components of these regulatory assets are being amortized over the
respective lives of the underlying generation facilities, consistent with the period over which the related revenues are recognized.

(3) Includes costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. Recovery of CEMA costs are subject to

CPUC review and approval.

(4) Includes specific incremental wildfire liability costs the CPUC approved for tracking in June 2018. Recovery of WEMA costs are subject to CPUC review and approval.
(5) Includes costs associated with the implementation of regulations and requirements adopted to protect the public from potential fire hazards associated with overhead power line facilities and

nearby aerial communication facilities that have not been previously authorized in another proceeding. Recovery of FHPMA costs are subject to CPUC review and approval.

In general, regulatory assets represent the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) recognized in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not
accrue interest.  Accordingly, the Utility earns a return on its regulatory assets for retained generation, and regulatory assets for unamortized loss, net of gain, on
reacquired debt.

(1) Represents the cumulative differences between asset removal costs recorded and amounts collected in rates for expected asset removal costs.
(2) Represents the net of amounts owed to customers for deferred taxes collected at higher rates before the Tax Act and amounts owed to the Utility for reversal of deferred taxes subject to flow-

through treatment. (See Note 8 below.)

(3) Represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates.  Decommissioning costs related to the Utility’s nuclear facilities are recovered through rates and

are placed in nuclear decommissioning trusts.  This regulatory liability also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on these nuclear decommissioning trust
investments.  (See Note 10 below.)

(4) Represents amounts received from customers designated for public purpose program costs expected to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, primarily related to energy efficiency programs.
(5) Represents cumulative differences between incurred costs and amounts collected in rates for Post-Retirement Medical, Post-Retirement Life and Long Term Disability Plans.

Regulatory Balancing Accounts

The Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and
customer billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months , the Utility records a current regulatory balancing
account receivable or payable.  Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as other
noncurrent assets – regulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do not
have an impact on net income.  Balancing accounts will fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and the timing of when costs are
incurred and customer revenues are collected.

Current regulatory balancing accounts receivable and payable are comprised of the following:

The electric distribution and utility generation accounts track the collection of revenue requirements approved in the GRC. The electric transmission accounts track
recovery of costs related to the transmission of electricity approved in the FERC TO rate cases. The gas distribution and transmission accounts track the collection
of revenue requirements approved in the GRC and the GT&S rate case.  Energy procurement balancing accounts track recovery of costs related to the procurement
of electricity, including any environmental compliance-related activities.  Public purpose programs balancing accounts are primarily used to record and recover
authorized revenue requirements for commission-mandated programs such as energy efficiency.

NOTE 4: DEBT

Debtor In Possession ("DIP") Facilities

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor in Possession Credit, Guaranty and
Security Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2019 (the “DIP Credit Agreement”), among the Utility, as borrower, PG&E Corporation, as guarantor, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the lenders and issuing banks party thereto (together with such other financial
institutions from time to time party thereto, the "DIP Lenders"). The DIP Credit Agreement provides for $5.5 billion in senior secured superpriority debtor in
possession credit facilities in the form of (i) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion (the “DIP Revolving Facility”), including a $1.5
billion letter of credit subfacility, (ii) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the “DIP Initial Term Loan Facility”) and (iii) a delayed
draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”, together with the DIP Revolving Facility
and the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility, the “DIP Facilities”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion seeking, among other things, interim and final approval of the DIP Facilities, which motion
was granted on an interim basis by the Bankruptcy Court following a hearing on January 31, 2019. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court’s interim approval of the
DIP Facilities and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019 and a portion of the DIP
Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&E Corporation and the
Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP
Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the
Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing,
but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final
hearing, or at all.

Borrowings under the DIP Facilities are senior secured obligations of the Utility, secured by substantially all of the Utility’s assets and entitled to superpriority
administrative expense claim status in the Utility’s Chapter 11 Case. The Utility’s obligations under the DIP Facilities are guaranteed by PG&E Corporation, and
such guarantee is a senior secured obligation of PG&E Corporation, secured by substantially all of PG&E Corporation’s assets and entitled to superpriority
administrative expense claim status in PG&E Corporation’s Chapter 11 Case.

119

The DIP Facilities mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility’s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are
satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the then-outstanding loans and available commitments. Borrowings under the DIP Facilities
will bear interest based, at the Utility’s election, on (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (2) ABR plus an applicable margin. ABR will equal the highest of the
following: (i) the administrative agent’s announced base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the (x) federal funds effective rate or (y) the overnight federal funds rate, whichever
is higher, (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% and (iv) zero . With respect to the DIP Revolving Facility, the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed
Draw Term Loan Facility, the applicable margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for ABR loans.

The Utility is also required to pay unused fees of (i) 0.375% per annum in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments under the DIP Revolving Facility
and (ii) 1.125% per annum, which amount shall increase to 2.25% per annum after six months, in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments under the
DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. The Utility must also pay (x) a fee equal to the applicable margin with respect to LIBOR loans under the DIP Revolving
Facility on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the DIP Revolving Facility and (y) a fronting fee to the relevant issuing DIP
Lender equal to 0.125% per annum of the aggregate drawable amount of outstanding letters of credit issued by such issuing DIP Lender.

The DIP Credit Agreement includes usual and customary covenants for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in
mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in
each case subject to customary exceptions for debtor in possession loan agreements of this type.

The DIP Credit Agreement also includes customary and usual representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including an obligation to deliver 13-week
cash flow forecasts and reports showing variances from such forecasts, in each case on a rolling 4-week basis. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s obligations
under the DIP Credit Agreement may be accelerated following certain events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties,
covenant defaults, cross-defaults to post-petition or unstayed indebtedness of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and their subsidiaries in excess of $200 million,
certain events under ERISA, unstayed judgments in respect of post-petition obligations involving an aggregate liability in excess of $200 million, change of
control, specified governmental actions having a material adverse effect or condemnation or damage to a material portion of the collateral. Certain bankruptcy-
related events are also events of default, including, but not limited to, the dismissal by the Bankruptcy Court of any of the Chapter 11 Cases, the conversion of any
of the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the appointment of a trustee pursuant to Chapter 11, any order authorizing the DIP
Facilities being stayed, vacated, reversed or amended in a manner adverse to the DIP Lenders, the final order approving the DIP Facilities failing to have been
entered by April 15, 2019, and certain other events related to the impairment of the DIP Lenders’ rights or liens granted under the DIP Credit Agreement.

The proceeds of the borrowings under the DIP Facilities will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to pay fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement and professional and other fees and costs of administration incurred in
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.

(1) On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility commenced reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted
an event of default or termination event under the above-referenced debt of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. With the exception of Pollution Control Bonds series 2008F and 2010E, where
a trustee notice is required to trigger acceleration, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of such debt, and the possibility of cure is
uncertain. Therefore, all long-term debt is classified as current as of December 31, 2018 .

(2) At December 31, 2018 , the interest rate on the Term Loan was 3.66% .
(3) Pollution Control Bonds series 2008F and 2010E were remarketed and issued in June 2017.  Although the stated maturity date for both series is 2026, these bonds have a mandatory

redemption date of May 31, 2022.

(4) Each series of these bonds is supported by a separate direct-pay letter of credit. Subject to certain requirements, the Utility may choose not to provide a credit facility without issuer consent.
Series 2009 A-B bonds have a maturity date of June 5, 2019. In December 2015, Series 1996 C, E, F, 1997 B bonds the letters of credit were extended to December 1, 2020. Although the
stated maturity date is 2026, each series will remain outstanding only if the Utility extends or replaces the letter of credit related to the series or otherwise obtains consent from the issuer to
the continuation of the series without a credit facility.

(5) At December 31, 2018 , the interest rate on these bonds was 2.08% .
(6) At December 31, 2018 , the interest rate on these bonds ranged from 2.05% to 2.15% .

121

Pollution Control Bonds

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank have issued various series of fixed rate
and multi-modal tax-exempt pollution control bonds for the benefit of the Utility.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the pollution control bonds were used to
finance or refinance pollution control and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at the Geysers geothermal power plant or at the Utility’s Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant.  In 1999, the Utility sold all bond-financed facilities at the non-retired units of the Geysers geothermal power plant to Geysers Power
Company, LLC pursuant to purchase and sales agreements stating that Geysers Power Company, LLC will use the bond-financed facilities solely as pollution
control facilities for so long as any tax-exempt pollution control bonds issued to finance the Geysers project are outstanding.  Except for components that may have
been abandoned in place or disposed of as scrap or that are permanently non-operational, the Utility has no knowledge that Geysers Power Company, LLC intends
to cease using the bond-financed facilities solely as pollution control facilities.

Repayment Schedule

PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's long-term debt is in default, and the Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations became immediately due and payable upon the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s combined stated long-term debt principal repayment amounts at December 31,
2018 are reflected in the table below:

For the year ended December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation’s average outstanding commercial paper balance was $29 million and the maximum outstanding
balance during the year was $137 million .  For the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Utility’s average outstanding commercial paper balance was $9 million
and the maximum outstanding balance during the year was $205 million .  As of December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility each had no commercial
paper borrowings outstanding. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect to be able to access the commercial paper market for the duration of the Chapter 11
Cases.

122

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of the
Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are
subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the
outstanding senior notes, agreements in respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term
borrowings under PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility. See Note 15 below for more information.

Revolving Credit Facilities

In May 2017, PG&E Corporation and the Utility each extended the termination dates of their existing revolving credit facilities by one year from April 27, 2021 to
April 27, 2022.  As previously disclosed, PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's revolving credit facilities have been subject to an automatic and immediate
acceleration as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. Prior to the Chapter 11 Cases, proceeds from the revolving credit facilities were used for working capital, the
repayment of commercial paper, and other corporate purposes.

Borrowings under each credit agreement (other than swingline loans) previously bore interest based on the borrower’s credit rating and on each borrower’s election
of either (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (2) the base rate plus an applicable margin.  The base rate equaled the higher of the following: the administrative
agent’s announced base rate, 0.5% above the overnight federal funds rate, and the one-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The borrower’s credit rating at
the time of borrowing determined the applicable rate within the following ranges.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranged between 0.9% and 1.475%
under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0.8% and 1.275% under the Utility’s credit agreement.  The applicable margin for base rate loans ranged
between 0% and 0.475% under PG&E Corporation’s credit agreement and between 0% and 0.275% under the Utility’s credit agreement.  In addition, the facility
fee under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit agreements ranged between 0.1% and 0.275% and between 0.075% and 0.225% , respectively.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities include usual and customary provisions for revolving credit facilities of this type, including those
regarding events of default and covenants limiting liens to those permitted under their senior note indentures, mergers, sales of all or substantially all of their
assets, and other fundamental changes.  In addition, the respective revolving credit facilities required that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain a ratio of
total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of at most 65% as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  PG&E Corporation’s revolving credit facility
agreement also required that PG&E Corporation own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the outstanding common stock and at least 70% of the outstanding
voting capital stock of the Utility.

Commercial Paper Programs

The borrowings from PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commercial paper programs were used primarily to fund temporary financing needs.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility could issue commercial paper up to the maximum amounts of $300 million and $2.5 billion , respectively. PG&E Corporation and the
Utility treated the amount of outstanding commercial paper as a reduction to the amount available under their respective revolving credit facilities.  The
commercial paper had maturities up to 365 days and ranked equally with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness.
Commercial paper notes were sold at an interest rate dictated by the market at the time of issuance.  For 2018 , the average yield on outstanding PG&E Corporation
and Utility commercial paper was 1.85% and 1.91% , respectively.

Other Short-term Borrowings

In February 2018, the Utility’s $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in February 2017, matured and was repaid. In February 2018, the Utility
entered into a $250 million floating rate unsecured term loan. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the
Utility’s outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, repayment of this loan, which was scheduled to mature on February 22, 2019, has
been stayed.

As of December 31, 2018 , PG&E Corporation and the Utility each had no commercial paper borrowings. PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect to be
able to access the commercial paper market for the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases.

In November 2018, the Utility's $500 million floating rate unsecured term loan, issued in November 2017, matured and was repaid.

NOTE 5: COMMON STOCK AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

PG&E Corporation had 520,338,710 shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2018 .  PG&E Corporation held all of the Utility’s outstanding common
stock at December 31, 2018 .

During 2018 , PG&E Corporation sold no shares of common stock under the February 2017 EDA.

In addition, during 2018 , PG&E Corporation sold 5.6 million shares of common stock under its 401(k) plan, the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,
and share-based compensation plans for total cash proceeds of $199 million. Beginning January 1, 2019 PG&E Corporation changed its default matching
contributions under its 401(k) plan from PG&E common stock to cash.

Dividends

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018,
due to the uncertainty related to the causes of and potential liabilities associated with wildfires. See Wildfire-related contingencies in Note 13 below.

Under the Utility’s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility’s preferred
stock have been paid.  Under their respective credit agreements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are each required to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt
to consolidated capitalization of at most 65% .  Based on the calculation of this ratio for each company,  no amount of PG&E Corporation's retained earnings and
$1.4 billion of the Utility's retained earnings was subject to this restriction at December 31, 2018 .  Additionally, the Utility's net assets, and therefore its ability to
pay dividends, are restricted by the CPUC-authorized capital structure, which requires the Utility to maintain, on average, at least 52% equity.  Based on the
calculation of this ratio,  none of the Utility's net assets were restricted at December 31, 2018 .  Additionally, as a result of this requirement, the Utility's ability to
pay dividends in the future could be impacted by future potential liabilities.  PG&E Corporation does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable
future.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

The PG&E Corporation LTIP permits various forms of share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other
share-based awards, to eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receive
certain share-based awards.  A maximum of 17 million shares of PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuance
under the 2014 LTIP, of which 15,150,532 shares were available for future awards at December 31, 2018 .

The following table provides a summary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for 2018 :

Share-based compensation costs are generally not capitalized.  There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information
disclosed above.

Stock Options

The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2014 LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’s
common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options generally have a 10 -year term and vest over four years of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting in
certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2018 , $1.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options were expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of a year and a half for PG&E Corporation.

124

The fair value of each stock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method.  The weighted average grant date fair value of
options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation method was $10.24 per share in 2018 .  The significant assumptions used for shares granted in 2018 were:

Expected stock price volatility

Expected annual dividend payment

Risk-free interest rate

Expected life (years)

2018

23.00%

3.10%

2.58%

6

Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date of
grant.  The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant.  The
expected life of stock options is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.

There was no tax benefit recognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2018 .

Restricted stock units granted after 2014 generally vest equally over three years . Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common
stock accompanied by cash payments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally
recognized ratably over the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2018
, 2017 , and 2016 was $40.92 , $66.95 , and $56.68 , respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was $41
million, $ 57 million, and $ 36 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested during each period was not material.  In general,
forfeitures are recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2018 , $43
million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average
period of 1.79 years.

Performance Shares

Performance shares generally will vest three years after the grant date.  Upon vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on either
PG&E Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a three -year performance period or, for a small number
of awards, an internal PG&E Corporation metric.  Dividend equivalents are paid in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are entitled.

Compensation expense attributable to performance share is generally recognized ratably over the applicable three -year period based on the grant-date fair value
determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model for the total shareholder return based awards or the grant-date market value of PG&E Corporation
common stock for internal metric based awards.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 was
$36.92 , $77.00 , and $53.61 respectively.  There was no tax benefit associated with performance shares during each of these periods.  In general, forfeitures are
recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2018 , $31 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 1.68
years.

NOTE 6: PREFERRED STOCK

PG&E Corporation has authorized 80 million shares of no par value preferred stock and 5 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock, which may be issued as
redeemable or nonredeemable preferred stock.  PG&E Corporation does not have any preferred stock outstanding.

The Utility has authorized 75 million shares of $25 par value preferred stock and 10 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock.  At December 31, 2018 and
December 31, 2017 , the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $145 million of shares with interest rates between 5% and 6% designated as nonredeemable
preferred stock and $113 million of shares with interest rates between 4.36% and 5% that are redeemable between $25.75 and $27.25 per share.  The Utility’s
preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption.  All outstanding preferred stock has a $25 par value.

At December 31, 2018 , annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferred
stock is subject to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends
through the redemption date.  At December 31, 2018 , annual dividends on redeemable preferred stock ranged from $1.09 to $1.25 per share.

Dividends on all Utility preferred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights.
Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaid
dividends, as specified for the class and series.  The Utility paid no dividends on preferred stock in 2018 (See "Dividends" in Note 5, above). The Utility paid $14
million of dividends on preferred stock in 2017 and 2016 .

NOTE 7: EARNINGS PER SHARE

PG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation of
diluted EPS.  The following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income available for common shareholders and weighted average common shares
outstanding for calculating diluted EPS for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 .

(in millions, except per share amounts)

For each of the periods presented above, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded an insignificant amount of options and
securities that were antidilutive.

NOTE 8: INCOME TAXES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferred

income taxes resulting from operations during the year. PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred
tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation
expense.

126

PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on
the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognized
tax benefit.

Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment
recovery period.  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.

PG&E Corporation files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more.
PG&E Corporation files a combined state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under which
the Utility determines its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.

(1) Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment.  In 2016, amounts reflect a settlement with the IRS on a 2011 audit related to electric transmission and distribution repairs

deductions.

(2) Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs as authorized by the 2014 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31,
2017 ), the 2017 GRC decision (impacting the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 ), and by the 2015 GT&S decision which impacted all periods presented.  All amounts are impacted
by the level of income before income taxes.  The 2014 GRC, 2017 GRC, and 2015 GT&S rate case decisions authorized revenue requirements that reflect flow-through ratemaking for
temporary income tax differences attributable to repair costs and certain other property-related costs for federal tax purposes.  For these temporary tax differences, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility recognize the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are
impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be
recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.  In 2018 , the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result
of the Tax Act passed in December 2017.

(3) Primarily represents adjustments to compensation as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act.
(4) Represents adjustments to deferred tax balances under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 reflecting the tax rate reduction required by the Tax Act.

The component of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2018 for PG&E Corporation and the Utility
was $5 million .

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months due to the resolution of several matters,
including audits.  As of December 31, 2018 , it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $50 million within the next 12

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted expansive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduces
the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and eliminated bonus depreciation for utilities. At December 31, 2017, PG&E
Corporation and the Utility recorded estimated provisional amounts to reflect the effect of the Tax Act in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.  In
2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded an approximately $13 million tax benefit to adjust the amount recorded in 2017 for the Tax Act upon obtaining,
preparing, and analyzing additional information regarding facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the
income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts.

Although the accounting under ASC 740 to reflect the Tax Act is now complete, the Treasury is still issuing interpretive guidance on various aspects of the Tax
Act. If future guidance requires a change in the recorded tax amounts, any necessary change will be reflected in the period such guidance is issued.

In addition, the Utility filed the estimated revenue impact of the Tax Act with the CPUC and FERC in March and May of 2018, respectively. As of December 31,
2018 , the Utility still has not received final regulatory decisions. Depending on the final regulatory outcome, an adjustment may need to be made in the period the
final decisions are issued.

Tax settlements

PG&E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2015 except for a few matters, the most significant of which relate to deductible repair costs for gas
transmission and distribution lines of business and tax deductions claimed for regulatory fines and fees assessed as part of the Penalty Decision issued in 2015 for
the San Bruno natural gas explosion in September of 2010. In February 2017, the Joint Committee of Taxation approved PG&E Corporation’s settlement with the
IRS related to deductible electric transmission and distribution repairs for the 2011 and 2012 tax years.  The agreement provided that the methodology used in
determining the deductible amount should be followed for all subsequent periods, absent any material change in facts.  In November 2017, PG&E Corporation
reached an agreement with the IRS on deductible generation repairs for the 2013 and 2014 tax years.

Tax years after 2007 remain subject to examination by the state of California.

PG&E Corporation believes it is more likely than not the tax benefits associated with the federal and California net operating losses, charitable contributions and
tax credits can be realized within the carryforward periods, therefore no valuation allowance was recognized as of December 31, 2018 for these tax attributes.

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation does not
believe that the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards. PG&E Corporation will continue to monitor the
status during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

NOTE 9: DERIVATIVES

Use of Derivative Instruments

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities. Procurement costs are recovered through
customer rates. The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.
Derivatives include contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-
counter.

Derivatives are presented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for
each counter-party. The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset
exist.

Price risk management instruments are not held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover in
rates all costs related to derivatives under the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in
accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded
within the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the

cost of electricity or the cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.

The Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are
expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business, and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity
delivered.  These items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Volume of Derivative Activity

At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, the volumes of the Utility’s outstanding derivatives were as follows:

Cash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The majority of the Utility’s derivatives instruments, including certain power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit
rating from each of the major credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. In January 2019, multiple credit rating agencies
downgraded the Utility below investment grade, resulting in the Utility posting $6.2 million to fully collateralize its net liability derivative positions.

NOTE 10: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value
hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:

•

•

•

Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 – Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for PG&E Corporation and the Utility are summarized below.  Assets held in rabbi trusts are held
by PG&E Corporation and not the Utility.

Valuation Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions on
the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed.  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of the
reporting period.  There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

Trust Assets

Assets
Measured
at
Fair
Value

In general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.
Nuclear decommissioning trust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments
that are money market funds valued at Level 1.

Global equity securities primarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.

132

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is
determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified as
Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model
generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation
model, as applicable.

Assets
Measured
at
NAV
Using
Practical
Expedient

Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient
have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges
as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities and asset-backed securities.

Price Risk Management Instruments

Price risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and
CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.

Power purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable market
forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures, or are
valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued using
observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.

Long-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using
either estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a
period for which market data is available.  Market and credit risk management utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3
instruments using pricing inputs from brokers and historical data.

The Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO
auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices. CRRs are classified as Level 3.

Level 3 Measurements and Sensitivity Analysis

The Utility’s market and credit risk management function, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for determining the fair value of the Utility’s
price risk management derivatives.  The Utility’s finance and risk management functions collaborate to determine the appropriate fair value methodologies and
classification for each derivative.  Inputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to
determine reasonableness.

Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to
Level 3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through customer rates; therefore, there is no impact to net income resulting from changes in the fair value of
these instruments.  See Note 9 above.

Financial Instruments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value for financial instruments: the fair values of cash, net
accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, customer deposits, and the Utility’s variable rate pollution control bond loan agreements
approximate their carrying values at  December 31, 2018  and 2017 , as they are short-term in nature or have interest rates that reset daily.

The carrying amount and fair value of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s long-term debt instruments, excluding pollution control bonds, were as follows (the

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cash
balance plan for those eligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying these
plans are qualified trusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deduct
payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts,
consistent with applicable regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plans up to the
amount it is authorized to recover in rates, $327 million for both 2018 and 2017 .

135

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory
postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.

On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to maintain existing pension and other benefit plans during
the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. (For more information see "Chapter 11 Proceedings" in Note 15 below.)

Non-service costs are reflected in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Service costs are reflected in Operating and maintenance on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.

Components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits other
than pension as components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accounting
purposes and expense or income for ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.  For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability is
recorded for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility
generally records a regulatory liability for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.  As the Utility is unable to
record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by determining projected stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset
allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were
projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates of
dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of 6.0% compares to a ten-year actual return
of 10.0% .  The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately 1,101 Aa-
grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2018 .  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash
flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

Investment Policies and Strategies

The financial position of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit
obligations.  Volatility in funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial
reporting, as well as the amount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded
status volatility.

The trusts’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants of
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes also
influence liability valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significant
allocations in long maturity fixed-income investments. Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-term
funding costs due to their higher expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-income
investments by exhibiting returns with low correlation to the direction of these markets. Real assets include commodities futures, global REITS, global listed
infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios.

Derivative instruments such as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure. Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasury
futures, are also used to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the pension’s portfolio. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of
the non U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments.

The target asset allocation percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows:

PG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guiding
principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability
and documentation.  Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk
through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.

In addition to the total plan assets disclosed at fair value in the table above, the trusts had other net liabilities of $22 million and other net assets of $116 million at
December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, comprised primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable.

Valuation Techniques

The following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that are
valued using a net asset value per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.

Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors. These securities are categorized as Level 1 and
Level 2 assets.

Global Equity securities

The global equity category includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public
exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identical
securities.  Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.

140

Real Assets

The real asset category includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodity
futures, global REITS, and global listed infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.

Fixed-Income securities

Fixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including
corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is
determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2
using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model
generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation
model, as applicable.

Assets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient

Investments in the trusts that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables
above. The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed
primarily of U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and private real estate funds. There are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which the
investments may be redeemed.

Transfers Between Levels

Any transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognized as of the end of the reporting period.  No material transfers between levels occurred in the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

Cash Flow Information

Employer Contributions

PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed $334 million to the pension benefit plans and $31 million to the other benefit plans in 2018 .  These contributions
are consistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicable
regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  None of these pension or other benefits were subject to a minimum funding requirement
requiring a cash contribution in 2018 .  The Utility’s pension benefits met all the funding requirements under Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  PG&E
Corporation and the Utility expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 327 million and $ 24 million to the pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plans, respectively, for 2019 .

Retirement Savings Plan

PG&E Corporation sponsors a retirement savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code 1986, as
amended.  This plan permits eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan, and provide for employer contributions to be made to
eligible participants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were
$105 million , $103 million , and $97 million in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively.

There were no material differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.

NOTE 12: RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS

The Utility and other subsidiaries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility and
PG&E Corporation exchange administrative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility are
priced at the higher of fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of the
services.  Services provided directly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending on
the nature and value of the services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries using
agreed-upon allocation factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies.
Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.

PG&E Corporation included in accounts payable – other on the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 13: WILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires. A provision for a loss
contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their best
estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a
range of losses is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and estimates are
adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other
information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs,
which are expensed as incurred. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially
affected by the outcome of the following matters.

On November 8, 2018, a wildfire began near the city of Paradise, Butte County, California (the “2018 Camp fire”), which is located in the Utility’s service
territory. Cal Fire's Camp Fire Incident Information Website as of January 4, 2019, (the “Cal Fire website”), indicated that the 2018 Camp fire consumed 153,336
acres. On the Cal Fire website, Cal Fire reported 86  fatalities and the destruction of 13,972 residences, 528 commercial structures and 4,293 other buildings
resulting from the 2018 Camp fire. On February 7, 2019, the Butte County Sheriff's Office reported that the number of fatalities resulting from the 2018 Camp fire
had been reduced from 86 to 85 .

Although the cause of the 2018 Camp fire is still under investigation, based on the information currently known to PG&E Corporation and the Utility and reported
to the CPUC and other agencies, including the facts described below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the Utility’s equipment will be
determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.

144

The Utility submitted two Electric Incident Reports (the “EIRs”) to the CPUC: one on November 8, 2018 and one on November 16, 2018. On December 11, 2018,
the Utility publicly released a letter to the CPUC supplementing the EIRs (the “ 20 -Day Electric Incident Report”), which stated:

•

•

•

•

On Cal Fire’s website, Cal Fire has identified coordinates for the 2018 Camp fire near Tower :27/222 on the Utility’s Caribou-Palermo 115 kV
Transmission Line and has identified the start time of the 2018 Camp fire as 6:33 a.m. on November 8, 2018.

On November 8, 2018, at approximately 6:15 a.m., the Utility’s Caribou-Palermo 115kV Transmission Line relayed and deenergized. At approximately
6:30 a.m. that day, a Utility employee observed fire in the vicinity of Tower :27/222, and this observation was reported to 911 by Utility employees. In the
afternoon of November 8, the Utility observed damage on the line at Tower :27/222. Specifically, an aerial patrol identified that a suspension insulator
supporting a transposition jumper had separated from an arm on Tower :27/222.

On November 14, 2018, the Utility observed a broken C-hook attached to the separated suspension insulator that had connected the suspension insulator
to a tower arm, along with wear at the connection point. In addition, the Utility observed a flash mark on Tower :27/222 near where the transposition
jumper was suspended and damage to the transposition jumper and suspension insulator.

In addition to the events on the Caribou-Palermo 115kV Transmission Line, on November 8, 2018, at approximately 6:45 a.m., the Utility’s Big Bend
1101 12 kV Circuit experienced an outage. On November 9, 2018, a Utility employee on patrol arrived at the location of the pole with Line Recloser
(“LR”) 1704 on the Big Bend 1101 Circuit and observed that the pole and other equipment were on the ground with bullets and bullet holes at the break
point of the pole and on the equipment. On November 12, 2018, a Utility employee was patrolling Concow Road north of LR 1704 when he observed
wires down and damaged and downed poles at the intersection of Concow Road and Rim Road. At this location, the employee observed several snapped
trees, with some on top of the downed wires.

The information contained in the EIRs and the 20-Day Electric Incident Report is factual and preliminary and does not reflect a determination of the causes of the
2018 Camp fire. These incidents remain under investigation by Cal Fire and the CPUC. With respect to the potential ignition point on the Utility’s Big Bend 1101
12 kV Circuit, although Cal Fire has identified this location as a potential ignition point, based on the condition of the site, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have
not been able to determine whether the Big Bend 1101 12 kV Circuit may be a probable ignition point for the 2018 Camp fire. Neither Cal Fire nor the CPUC has
publicly issued any news releases or other determinations for the 2018 Camp fire. The timing and outcome of the investigations are uncertain. PG&E Corporation
and the Utility are cooperating with Cal Fire and the CPUC.

Further, the CPUC’s SED is conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and
regulations in fire-impacted areas. According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of
facilities, vegetation management, and emergency preparedness and response. Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating the fire.
It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether the SED will release any preliminary findings before its investigations are complete.

2017 Northern California Wildfires Background

Beginning on October 8, 2017, multiple wildfires spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada, and
Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”). According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire
Summary dated October 30, 2017, at the peak of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, there were 21 major fires that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres and
destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures. The 2017 Northern California wildfires resulted in 44 fatalities.

145

Cal Fire has issued its determination on the causes of 19 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and alleged that all of these fires, with the exception of the
Tubbs fire, involved the Utility's equipment. The remaining wildfires remain under Cal Fire's investigation, including the possible role of the Utility's power lines
and other facilities.

During the second quarter of 2018, Cal Fire issued news releases announcing its determination on the causes of 16 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires (the
La Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood, Sulphur, Cherokee, 37, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Nuns, Pocket and Atlas fires, located in
Mendocino, Lake, Butte, Sonoma, Humboldt, Nevada and Napa counties). According to the Cal Fire news releases, the first four fires “were caused by trees
coming into contact with power lines” and the remaining 12 fires “were caused by electric power and distribution lines, conductors and the failure of power poles.”
Cal Fire has not yet released its investigation reports related to the McCourtney, Lobo, Sulphur, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and Atlas fires
and stated in its news releases that these investigations have been referred to the appropriate county District Attorney’s offices for review “due to evidence of
alleged violations of state law.” The Butte County District Attorney's office has entered into a settlement agreement with the Utility, resolving the Honey,
Cherokee and LaPorte fire allegations without criminal or civil charges. The timing and outcome for resolution of the remaining referrals are uncertain.

Also during the second quarter of 2018, Cal Fire released its investigation reports related to the Redwood, Cherokee, 37, Nuns and La Porte fires. Cal Fire did not
refer these fires to District Attorney offices for investigation.

On October 9, 2018, Cal Fire issued a news release announcing the results of its investigation into the Cascade fire, located in Yuba County, concluding that the
Cascade fire “was started by sagging power lines coming into contact during heavy winds” and that “the power line in question was owned by Pacific Gas and
Electric Company.” On October 10, 2018, Cal Fire released its investigation report related to the Cascade fire.

On January 24, 2019, Cal Fire issued a news release and its investigation report into the cause of the Tubbs fire. Cal Fire has determined that the Tubbs fire was
caused by a private electrical system adjacent to a residential structure.

Cal Fire has not publicly issued any news releases or other determinations for the Maacama, Pressley and Point wildfires. The timing and outcome of the Cal Fire
investigation into these fires is uncertain.

Further, the SED is conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies’ facilities with applicable rules and regulations in
fire-impacted areas. According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities,
vegetation management, and emergency preparedness and response. Various other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the
fires. It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether the SED will release any preliminary findings before its investigations are complete.

The Utility has submitted 23 electric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire or the Utility has
identified a site as potentially involving the Utility’s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $ 50,000 . The
information contained in these reports is factual and preliminary and does not reflect a determination of the causes of the fires.

Third-Party Claims, Investigations and Other Proceedings Related to the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires

If the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of
inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees without having been found
negligent. California courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the
grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from
such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Further, California courts have determined
that the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs. The CPUC
may decide not to authorize cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse
condemnation. (See “Loss Recoveries-Regulatory Recovery” below for further information regarding potential cost recovery related to the wildfires, including in
connection with SB 901.)

146

In addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest and attorneys’ fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs,
medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been
negligent.

Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminal
proceeding, and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

As of January 28, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 100 complaints on behalf of at least 4,200 plaintiffs related to the 2018
Camp fire, nine of which seek to be certified as class actions. The pending civil litigation against PG&E Corporation and the Utility related to the 2018 Camp fire,
which is currently stayed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, includes claims under multiple theories of liability, including inverse
condemnation, trespass, private nuisance, public nuisance, negligence, negligence per se, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, negligent
infliction of emotional distress, premises liability, violations of the Public Utilities Code, violations of the Health & Safety Code, malice and false advertising in
violation of the California Business and Professions Code. The plaintiffs principally assert that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s alleged failure to maintain
and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire.
The plaintiffs seek damages and remedies that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, establishment of a
class action medical monitoring fund, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such
claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.

As of January 28, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately 750 complaints on behalf of at least 3,800 plaintiffs related to the 2017
Northern California wildfires, five of which seek to be certified as class actions. These cases have been coordinated in the San Francisco County Superior Court.
As of the Petition Date, the coordinated litigation was in the early stages of discovery. A trial with respect to the Atlas fire was scheduled to begin on September
23, 2019. The pending civil litigation against PG&E Corporation and the Utility related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, includes claims under multiple
theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, trespass, private nuisance and negligence. This litigation, including the trial date with respect to the Atlas fire,
currently is stayed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. The plaintiffs principally assert that PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s alleged
failure to maintain and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the
2017 Northern California wildfires. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical
expenses, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be
determined through the Chapter 11 process.

Insurance carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires have filed 48 subrogation
complaints in the San Francisco County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation,
trespass and nuisance. The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. As of January 28, 2019, insurance carriers have filed 37 similar
subrogation complaints with respect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with
respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.

Various government entities, including Yuba, Nevada, Lake, Mendocino, Napa and Sonoma Counties and the Cities of Santa Rosa and Clearlake, also have
asserted claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility based on the damages that these government entities allegedly suffered as a result of the 2017 Northern
California wildfires. Such alleged damages include, among other things, loss of natural resources, loss of public parks, property damages and fire suppression
costs. The causes of action and allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs and the insurance carriers. With respect to the 2018 Camp fire,
Butte County has filed similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect additional similar claims to be
made by other government entities. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the
Chapter 11 process.

On March 16, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer to the inverse condemnation cause of action in the 2017 Northern California wildfires
litigation. On May 21, 2018, the court overruled the motion. On July 20, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a writ in the Court of Appeal requesting
appellate review of the trial court's decision, which was denied on September 17, 2018. On September 27, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a petition
for review to the California Supreme Court. On November 14, 2018, the California Supreme Court denied PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's petition for
review.

147

PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject of numerous additional claims in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California
wildfires. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility also are the subject of criminal investigations or other actions by the county District Attorneys to whom Cal Fire has referred its
investigations into the McCourtney, Lobo, Sulphur, Blue, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian, Pocket and Atlas fires. Although the Honey fire was referred to the
Butte County District Attorney’s Office, in October 2018, the Utility reached an agreement to settle any civil claims or criminal charges that could have been
brought by the Butte County District Attorney in connection with the Honey fire, as well as the La Porte and Cherokee fires (which were not referred). The
settlement provides for funding by the Utility for at least four years of an enhanced fire prevention and communication program, in the amount of up to $1.5
million , not recoverable in rates. On October 9, 2018, the District Attorney of Yuba County announced his decision not to pursue criminal charges at such time
against PG&E Corporation or the Utility pertaining to the Cascade fire. The Office of the District Attorney of Yuba County also indicated that it “reserves the right
to review any additional information or evidence that may be submitted to it prior to the expiration of the criminal statute of limitations.”

Also in October 2018, the Utility and the Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Humboldt and Nevada County District Attorneys entered into agreements under which the Utility
agreed to waive any applicable statutes of limitation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires that started in these counties for a period of six months , until
April 8, 2019. PG&E Corporation and the Utility anticipate further discussions with the District Attorneys in these counties relating to the 2017 Northern
California wildfires and whether any criminal or civil charges should be brought. In addition, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California
Attorney General’s Office have opened a criminal investigation of the 2018 Camp fire. Additional investigations and other actions may arise out of the other 2017
Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are continuing to review the evidence concerning the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility have not yet had access to all of the evidence collected by Cal Fire as part of its investigations or to the many investigation reports
prepared by Cal Fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility and plaintiffs are in discussions with Cal Fire about access to the evidence and the remaining reports. No
schedule on gaining access has been set.

Regardless of any determinations of cause by Cal Fire with respect to any pre-petition fire, ultimately PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability will be
resolved through the Chapter 11 process, regulatory proceedings and any potential enforcement proceedings, all of which could take a number of years to resolve.
The timing and outcome of these and other potential proceedings are uncertain.

Potential Losses in Connection with the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires

On January 28, 2019, the California Department of Insurance issued a news release announcing an update on property losses in connection with the 2018 wildfires
in Southern California (which are not in the Utility’s service territory) and the 2018 Camp fire, stating that, as of such date, “more than $11.4 billion in insured
losses have been reported from the November 2018 fires,” of which approximately $8.4 billion relates to statewide claims from the 2018 Camp fire. On September
6, 2018, the California Department of Insurance issued a news release announcing that insurers have received nearly 55,000 insurance claims totaling more than
$12.28 billion in losses, of which approximately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the 2017 Northern California wildfires.

The dollar amounts announced by the California Department of Insurance represent an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made
as of the above dates related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims have
been submitted and will continue to be submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The
$18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the above dates does not account for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys’ fees, fire
suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages,
fines or penalties, or losses related to claims that have not manifested yet ("future claims"), each of which could be significant. The scope of all claims related to
the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law.

148

Potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of each
fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants,
the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs,
other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities.

There are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. Among other things, it is uncertain at this time
as to the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current and future claims that will be allowed by the
Bankruptcy Court, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed, and the
impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11 Cases. If PG&E Corporation and the
Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern
California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion , which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or
damages related to future claims. This estimate is based on a wide variety of data and other information available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility and their
advisors, including various precedents involving similar claims, and accounts for property losses (including insured, uninsured and underinsured property losses),
interest, attorneys’ fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses and certain other
costs. This estimate is not intended to provide an upper end of the range of potential liability arising from the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California
wildfires. In certain circumstances, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s liability could be substantially greater than such amount.

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, fines
and penalties could be significant. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example,
in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with the natural gas explosion that occurred in the
City of San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 (the “San Bruno explosion”). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the
San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The
amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&E Corporation and the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying
liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims
are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of
the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Northern California Wildfires Accounting Charge

Following accounting rules, PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a liability when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. In accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably
estimated losses, and record a charge that is the amount within the range that is a better estimate than any other amount or the lower end of the range, if there is no
better estimate. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of losses is estimable, often involves a series
of complex judgments about future events.

2018 Camp Fire

In light of the current state of the law and the information currently available to the Utility, including, among other things, the facts described in the EIRs and the
20 -Day Electric Incident Report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur a loss for claims in connection with the
2018 Camp fire, and accordingly PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a charge in the amount of $10.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
charge corresponds to the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s reasonably estimated losses, and is subject to change based on additional
information.

149

PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern
California wildfires will be greater than the amount accrued, but are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because there
are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that
may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and other
information as it becomes available, including evidence in Cal Fire’s possession, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted,
and additional information about the nature and extent of personal and business property damage and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries,
and information made available through the discovery process.

The process for estimating losses associated with claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective
factors, including but not limited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As more
information becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2018 Camp fire may change, which could result in
material increases to the loss accrued.

The $10.5 billion charge does not include any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the
Utility, or punitive damages, if any, or any losses related to future claims for damages that have not manifested yet, each of which could be significant.

2017 Northern California Wildfires

In light of the current state of the law on inverse condemnation and the information currently available to the Utility, including, among other things, the Cal Fire
determinations of cause as stated in Cal Fire’s press releases and their released reports, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they
will incur a loss for claims in connection with 17 of the 2017 Northern California wildfires referred to as the La Porte, McCourtney, Lobo, Honey, Redwood,
Sulphur, Cherokee, Blue, Pocket, Atlas, Cascade, Point and Sonoma/Napa merged fires (which include the Nuns, Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick and Pythian fires).
Accordingly, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a charge in the amount of $2.5 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and a charge in the amount
of $1.0 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, for a total charge in the amount of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This charge
corresponds to the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimated losses and is subject to change based on additional
information. The additional charge recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 resulted from additional information obtained by the Utility during that period
about the fires.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and
the 2018 Camp fire will be greater than the amount accrued, but are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss and the upper end of the range because there
are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that
may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and other
information as it becomes available, including evidence in Cal Fire’s possession, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted,
and additional information about the nature and extent of personal and business property damage and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries,
and information made available through the discovery process.

The process for estimating losses associated with claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective
factors, including but not limited to factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As more
information becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2017 Northern California wildfires may change,
which could result in material increases to the loss accrued.

The $3.5 billion charge does not include any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the
Utility, or punitive damages, if any, or any losses related to future claims for damages that have not manifested yet, each of which could be significant.

The $3.5 billion charge also does not include any amounts in connection with the 37, Tubbs, Maacama and Pressley fires because at this time PG&E Corporation
and the Utility have not concluded that a loss arising from those fires is probable. However, in the future it is possible that facts could emerge that lead PG&E
Corporation and the Utility to believe that a loss is probable, resulting in the accrual of a liability at that time, the amount of which could be significant.

150

Loss Recoveries

PG&E Corporation and the Utility had insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire. Additionally, there are several mechanisms that allow for recovery of
costs from customers. Potential for recovery is described below. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017
Northern California wildfires or any conclusion that such recovery is no longer probable could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the inability to recover costs in in a timely manner could have a material effect on
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Insurance

PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $842 million of insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through
July 31, 2018, subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence and further retentions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During
the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately
$1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of
$10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200
million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to face increasing difficulty securing
liability insurance in future years due to availability and to face significantly increased insurance costs.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur. Through
December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $1.38 billion for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and $842
million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. These amounts reflect an assumption that the cause of each
fire is deemed to be a separate occurrence under the insurance policies. The amount of the receivable is subject to change based on additional information. PG&E
Corporation and the Utility intend to seek full recovery for all insured losses and believe it is reasonably possible that they will record a receivable for the full
amount of the insurance limits in the future.

If PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, or if insurance is otherwise unavailable, PG&E Corporation’s and the
Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. Even if PG&E Corporation and the Utility were to recover
the full amount of their insurance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California
wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance.

The following table presents changes in the insurance receivable for the year ended December 31, 2018. The balance for insurance receivable is included in Other

Regulatory Recovery

On June 21, 2018, the CPUC issued a decision granting the Utility’s request to establish a WEMA to track specific incremental wildfire liability costs effective as
of July 26, 2017. The decision does not grant the Utility rate recovery of any wildfire-related costs. Any such rate recovery would require CPUC authorization in a
separate proceeding. The Utility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance, if at all. Rate recovery is uncertain, therefore the Utility has not
recorded a regulatory asset related to any wildfire claims costs. Even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of years
to collect.

In addition, SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain
disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its
ability to provide adequate and safe service (the “Customer Harm Threshold”). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery,
through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the
2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible
2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018.

On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer
Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC stated
that “consistent with Section 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the
recovery of specific costs related to the 2017 wildfires.” Following the CPUC’s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&E Corporation and the
Utility believe that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims
relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such
costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the
Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in
the OIR.

On February 11, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUC
should (1) promptly set a Customer Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity to
enable PG&E Corporation and the Utility and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capital
needed to resolve claims arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) define
how the Customer Harm Threshold will be applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&E
Corporation and the Utility can raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up to
approximately $3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization.

Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires or any conclusion that such recovery is
no longer probable could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.

Wildfire-Related Derivative Litigation

Two purported derivative lawsuits alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on
November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively, naming as defendants current and certain former members of the Board of Directors and certain current
and former officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are named as nominal defendants. These lawsuits were consolidated
by the court on February 14, 2018, and are denominated In
Re
California
North
Bay
Fire
Derivative
Litigation
. On April 13, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a
consolidated complaint. After the parties reached an agreement regarding a stay of the derivative proceeding pending resolution of the tort actions described above
and any regulatory proceeding relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, on April 24, 2018, the court entered a stipulation and order to stay. The stay is
subject to certain conditions regarding the plaintiffs' access to discovery in other actions. On January 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a request to lift the stay for the
purposes of amending their complaint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire.

152

On August 3, 2018, a third purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Oklahoma
Firefighters
Pension
and
Retirement
System
v.
Chew,
et
al.
, was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and certain current and
former officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. PG&E Corporation is named as a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary
duties and unjust enrichment as well as a claim under Section 14(a) of the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 alleging that PG&E Corporation's and the
Utility's 2017 proxy statement contained misrepresentations regarding the companies' risk management and safety programs. On October 15, 2018, PG&E
Corporation filed a motion to stay the litigation. The hearing on this motion, previously set for January 31, 2019, was moved by stipulation of the parties and order
of the court to March 7, 2019.

On October 23, 2018, a fourth purported derivative lawsuit, entitled City
of
Warren
Police
and
Fire
Retirement
System
v.
Chew,
et
al.,
was filed in San Francisco
County Superior Court, alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust enrichment. It names as defendants certain current and former
members of the Board of Directors and certain current and former officers of PG&E Corporation, and names PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff
filed a request with the court seeking the voluntary dismissal of this matter without prejudice on January 18, 2019.

On November 21, 2018, a fifth purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Williams
v.
Earley,
Jr.,
et
al.
, was filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleging claims
identical to those alleged in the Oklahoma
Firefighters
Pension
and
Retirement
System
v.
Chew,
et
al
. lawsuit listed above against certain current and former
officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. This lawsuit includes allegations related to the 2017 Northern
California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire. This action was stayed by stipulation of the parties and order of the court on December 21, 2018, subject to resolution
of the pending securities class action.

On December 24, 2018, a sixth purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Bowlinger
v.
Chew,
et
al.
, was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and former
officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants. The court scheduled an initial case management conference for March
21, 2019.

On January 25, 2019, a seventh purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Hagberg
v.
Chew,
et
al.
, was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment in connection with the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and former
officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation and the Utility as nominal defendants.

On January 28, 2019, an eighth purported derivative lawsuit, entitled Blackburn
v.
Meserve,
et
al.
, was filed in federal court alleging claims for breach of fiduciary
duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire against certain current and
former officers and directors, and naming PG&E Corporation as a nominal defendant.

Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed notices in each of these proceedings on February 1, 2019, reflecting
that the proceedings are automatically stayed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 5, 2019, the plaintiff in Bowlinger
v.
Chew,
et
al.
filed a response to the notice asserting that the automatic stay did not apply to his claims. The court has not yet acted on the plaintiff’s response.

Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action Litigation

In June 2018, two purported securities class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming PG&E
Corporation and certain of its current and former officers as defendants, entitled David
C.
Weston
v.
PG&E
Corporation,
et
al.
and Jon
Paul
Moretti
v.
PG&E
Corporation,
et
al.
, respectively.  The complaints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions related to, among other things, vegetation management and
transmission line safety in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures. The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the federal
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys' fees and other costs. Both
complaints identified a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018. On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases and the litigation is now
denominated In
Re
PG&E
Corporation
Securities
Litigation
. The court also appointed the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico as lead
plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018. After the plaintiff requested leave to amend their complaint to add allegations
regarding the 2018 Camp fire, the plaintiff filed a second amended consolidated complaint on December 14, 2018.

Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a notice on February 1, 2019, reflecting that the proceedings are
automatically stayed pursuant to Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. On February 15, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a complaint in Bankruptcy
Court against the plaintiff seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims alleged against the individual officer defendants.

On February 22, 2019, a purported securities class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled York
County
on
behalf
of
the
York
County
Retirement
Fund,
et
al.
v.
Rambo,
et
al
. The complaint names as defendants certain current and former officers and directors, as well
as the underwriters of 4 public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018. Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility is named as a defendant. The complaint alleges
material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetation
management and wildfire safety measures. The complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of the federal Securities Act of 1933, and seeks
unspecified monetary relief, attorneys’ fees and other costs, and injunctive relief. If necessary, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to file a complaint in
Bankruptcy Court against the plaintiffs seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to extend the stay to the claims alleged against the individual officer
and director defendants.

Clean-up and Repair Costs

The Utility incurred costs of $354 million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities (including $183 million in capital expenditures) through December 31,
2018, in connection with the 2018 Camp fire. The Utility also incurred costs of $ 327 million for clean-up and repair of the Utility’s facilities (including $ 157
million in capital expenditures) through December 31, 2018, in connection with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. The Utility is authorized to track and seek
recovery of clean-up and repair costs through CEMA. (CEMA requests are subject to CPUC approval.) The Utility capitalizes and records as regulatory assets
costs that are probable of recovery. At December 31, 2018, the CEMA balance related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires was $ 82 million and is included in
long-term regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the capital expenditures for clean-up and repair are included in property, plant and
equipment at December 31, 2018.

Should PG&E Corporation and the Utility conclude that recovery of any clean-up and repair costs included in the CEMA is no longer probable, PG&E Corporation
and the Utility will record a charge in the period such conclusion is reached. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of these costs or any conclusion that
such recovery is no longer probable, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
cash flows.

2015 Butte Fire

In September 2015, a wildfire (the “2015 Butte fire”) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. On April 28, 2016, Cal
Fire released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the 2015 Butte fire. According to Cal Fire’s report, the 2015 Butte fire burned 70,868 acres,
resulted in two fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures.  Cal Fire’s report concluded that the
2015 Butte fire was caused when a gray pine tree contacted the Utility’s electric line, which ignited portions of the tree and determined that the failure by the
Utility and/or its vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program
ultimately led to the failure of the tree.

154

Third-Party Claims

On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of
California, County of Sacramento.  Subrogation insurers also filed a separate master complaint on the same date.  The California Judicial Council previously had
authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County.  As of January 31, 2019, 95 known complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two
vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador.  The complaints
involve approximately 3,900 individual plaintiffs representing approximately 2,000 households and their insurance companies.  These complaints are part of, or
were in the process of being added to, the coordinated proceeding.  Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inverse
condemnation and negligence theory of liability.  Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages.  Several plaintiffs dismissed the Utility's two vegetation management
contractors from their complaints. The Utility does not expect the number of claimants to increase significantly in the future, because the statute of limitations for
property damage and personal injury in connection with the 2015 Butte fire has expired. Further, due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these
plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&E Corporation or the Utility on
account of pre-petition obligations. On January 30, 2019, the Court in the coordinated proceeding issued an order staying the action.

On April 28, 2017, the Utility moved for summary adjudication on plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.  The court denied the Utility’s motion and the Utility
filed a writ with the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Third Appellate District. The writ was granted on July 2, 2018, directing the trial court to enter
summary adjudication in favor of the Utility and to deny plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages under California Civil Code Section 3294. Plaintiffs sought
rehearing and asked the California Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeal's decision. Both requests were denied. Neither the trial nor appellate courts
originally addressed whether plaintiffs can seek punitive damages at trial under Public Utilities Code Section 2106. However, the trial court, in November 2018,
denied a motion filed by the Utility that would have confirmed that punitive damages under Public Utilities Code Section 2106 are unavailable. The Utility
believes a loss related to punitive damages is unlikely, but possible.

On June 22, 2017, the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento ruled on a motion of several plaintiffs and found that the doctrine of inverse
condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. The court held, among other things, that the Utility had failed to put forth any evidence to
support its contention that the CPUC would not allow the Utility to pass on its inverse condemnation liability through rate increases. While the ruling is binding
only between the Utility and the plaintiffs in the coordination proceeding at the time of the ruling, others could make similar claims. On January 4, 2018, the Utility
filed with the court a renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability, citing the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision denying the San
Diego Gas & Electric Company application to recover wildfire costs in excess of insurance, and the CPUC declaration that it will not automatically allow utilities
to spread inverse condemnation losses through rate increases.

On May 1, 2018, the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento issued its ruling on the Utility’s renewed motion in which the court affirmed, with minor
changes, its tentative ruling dated April 25, 2018. The court determined that it is bound by earlier holdings of two appellate courts decisions, Barham
and Pacific
Bell
. Further, the court stated that the Utility's constitutional arguments should be made to the appellate courts and suggested that, to the extent the Utility raises
the public policy implications of the November 30, 2017 CPUC decision in the San Diego Gas & Electric Company cost recovery proceeding, these arguments
should be addressed to the Legislature or CPUC. The Utility filed a writ with the Court of Appeal seeking immediate review of the court's decision. On June 18,
2018, after the writ was summarily denied, the Utility filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court, which also was denied. On September 6,
2018, the court set a trial for some individual plaintiffs to begin on April 1, 2019. The Utility reached agreement with two plaintiffs in the litigation to stipulate to
judgment against the Utility on inverse condemnation grounds. The court granted the Utility's stipulated judgment motion on November 29, 2018 and the Utility
filed its appeal on December 11, 2018. As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, these lawsuits, including the trial and the appeal from the stipulated
judgment, are stayed.

In addition to the coordinated plaintiffs, Cal Fire, the California Office of Emergency Services (the “OES”), the County of Calaveras, and five smaller public
entities ( three fire districts, one water district and the California Department of Veterans Affairs) have brought suit or indicated that they intend to do so. The five
smaller public entities filed their complaints in August 2018 and September 2018. They have been added to the coordinated proceedings. The Utility has settled the
claims of the three fire protection districts.

155

On April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a complaint with the Superior Court of California, County of Calaveras, seeking to recover over $ 87 million for its costs incurred
on the theory that the Utility and its vegetation management contractors were negligent, or violated the law, among other claims.  On July 31, 2017, Cal Fire
dismissed its complaint against Trees, Inc., one of the Utility's vegetation contractors. Cal Fire had requested that a trial of its claims be set in 2019, following any
trial of the claims of the individual plaintiffs. On October 19, 2018, the Utility filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that Cal Fire cannot recover any fire
suppression costs under the Third District Court of Appeal's decision in Dep't
of
Forestry
&
Fire
Prot.
v.
Howell
(2017) 18 Cal. App. 5th 154. The hearing on that
motion was set for January 31, 2019, but the hearing and Cal Fire’s case against the Utility are now stayed. Prior to the stay, the Utility and Cal Fire were also
engaged in a mediation process.

Also, on February 20, 2018, the County of Calaveras filed suit against the Utility and the Utility’s vegetation management contractors to recover damages and
other costs, based on the doctrine of inverse condemnation and negligence theory of liability. The County also sought punitive damages. On March 2, 2018, the
County served a mediation demand seeking in excess of $ 167 million , having previously indicated that it intended to bring an approximately $ 85 million claim
against the Utility. This claim included costs that the County of Calaveras allegedly incurred or expected to incur for infrastructure damage, erosion control, and
other costs. The Utility and the County of Calaveras settled the County's claims in November 2018 for $ 25.4 million .

Further, in May 2017, the OES indicated that it intended to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimated to be approximately $ 190 million .  This claim would
include costs incurred by the OES for tree and debris removal, infrastructure damage, erosion control, and other claims related to the 2015 Butte fire. The Utility
has not received any information or documentation from OES since its May 2017 statement. In June 2017, the Utility entered into an agreement with the OES that
extends their deadline to file a claim to December 2020.

PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such outstanding claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process.

Estimated Losses from Third-Party Claims

In connection with the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been
found negligent, through the doctrine of inverse condemnation.

In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility is found to have been negligent.  While
the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility.

The Utility’s assessment of the estimated loss related to the 2015 Butte fire is based on assumptions about the number, size, and type of structures damaged or
destroyed, the contents of such structures, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, as well as assumptions about personal injury damages, attorneys’
fees, fire suppression costs, and certain other damages.

The Utility has determined that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $ 1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. While this amount includes the Utility's
assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from the OES. The
Utility still does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate any liability it may have for that additional claim.

The process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the 2015 Butte fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of
assumptions and subjective factors.  As more information becomes known, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the 2015
Butte fire may result in material increases to the loss accrued.

(1) As of December 31, 2018 , the Utility has paid $ 874 million of the $ 904 million in settlements to date in connection with the 2015 Butte fire.

If the Utility records losses in connection with claims relating to the 2015 Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities,
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods
during which additional charges are recorded.

Loss Recoveries

The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, that provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2015 Butte fire in an aggregate amount of
$ 922 million .  The Utility records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that a recovery will occur and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount
or its range.  Through December 31, 2018 , the Utility recorded $ 922 million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with losses related to the 2015 Butte
fire.  While the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.  In addition,
the Utility has received $ 60 million in cumulative reimbursements from the insurance policies of its vegetation management contractors (excluded from the table
below), including $ 7 million received in the year ended December 31, 2018 . Recoveries of additional amounts under the insurance policies of the Utility’s
vegetation management contractors, including policies where the Utility is listed as an additional insured, are uncertain.

NOTE 14: OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation
matters and environmental remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower
end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably
possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed
quarterly and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of
legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s policy is to exclude anticipated legal costs
from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred. The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into
to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation has financial commitments described in “Other Commitments”
below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the
following matters.

Enforcement Matters

In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly
improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel.  The Utility has cooperated with those investigations.  It is uncertain whether any charges will
be brought against the Utility. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however,
collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

CPUC and FERC Matters

Order Instituting an Investigation and Order to Show Cause into the Utility's Locate and Mark practices

On December 14, 2018, the CPUC issued an OII and order to show cause (the "OII") to assess the Utility's practices and procedures related to the locating and
marking of natural gas facilities. The OII directs the Utility to show cause as to why the Commission should not find violations in this matter, and why the
Commission should not impose penalties, and/or any other forms of relief, if any violations are found. The Utility also is directed in the OII to provide a report on
specific matters, including that it is conducting locate and mark programs in a safe manner.

The OII cites a report by the SED dated December 6, 2018, which alleges that the Utility violated the law pertaining to the locating and marking of its gas facilities
and falsified records related to its locate and mark activities between 2012 and 2017. As described in the OII, the SED cites reports issued in this matter by two
consultants retained by the Utility, that (i) included certain facts and conclusions about the extent of inaccuracies in the Utility’s late tickets and the reasons for the
inaccuracies, and (ii) provided the Utility’s late tickets counts, and identification of associated dig-ins. As a result, the OII will determine whether the Utility
violated any provision of the Public Utilities Code, general orders, federal law adopted by California, other rules, or requirements, and/or other state or federal law,
by its locate and mark policies, practices, and related issues, and the extent to which the Utility’s practices with regard to locate and mark may have diminished
system safety.

The CPUC indicates that it has not concluded that the Utility has violated the law in any instance pertaining to late tickets, locating and marking, or any matter
related to either, or to any other matter raised in this OII. However, if violations are found, the CPUC will consider what monetary fines and other remedies are
appropriate, will review the duration of violations and, if supported by the evidence, it will consider ordering daily fines.

On January 14, 2019, the Utility submitted responses to preliminary questions raised in the OII and separately filed an affidavit regarding the safety of the locate
and mark program. On March 14, 2019, as directed by the CPUC, the Utility expects to submit a report that addresses the SED report and respond to the order to
show cause. A schedule for future proceedings is expected to be established at an April 5, 2019 pre-hearing conference.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that the CPUC will impose penalties, including fines or other remedies, on the Utility. The Utility is unable
to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the CPUC's wide discretion and the number of factors that can be
considered in determining penalties. The Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of this proceeding.

158

Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in
connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

Order Instituting an Investigation into Compliance with Ex Parte Communication Rules

During 2014 and 2015, the Utility filed several reports to notify the CPUC of communications that the Utility believes may have constituted or described ex parte
communications that either should not have occurred or that should have been timely reported to the CPUC.  Ex parte communications include communications
between a decision maker and interested persons concerning substantive issues in certain formal proceedings.  Certain communications are prohibited and others
are permissible with proper noticing and reporting.

On November 23, 2015, the CPUC issued an OII into whether the Utility should be sanctioned for violating rules pertaining to ex parte communications and Rule
1.1 of the CPUC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure governing the conduct of those appearing before the CPUC.  The OII cites some of the communications the
Utility reported to the CPUC.  The OII also cites the ex parte violations alleged in the City of San Bruno’s July 2014 motion, which it filed in CPUC investigations
related to the Utility’s natural gas transmission pipeline operations and practices.

On April 26, 2018, the CPUC approved the revised proposed decision issued on April 3, 2018, adopting the settlement agreement jointly submitted to the CPUC on
March 28, 2017, as modified (the "settlement agreement") by the Utility, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, Cal PA, the SED, and TURN.

The decision results in a total penalty of $97.5 million comprised of: (1) a $12 million payment to the California General Fund,
(2) forgoing collection of $63.5 million of GT&S revenue requirements for the years 2018 ( $31.75 million ) and 2019 ( $31.75 million ), (3) a $10 million one-
time revenue requirement adjustment to be amortized in equivalent annual amounts over the Utility’s next GRC cycle (i.e., the 2020 GRC), and (4) compensation
payments to the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos in a total amount of $12 million ( $6 million to each city). In addition, the settlement agreement provides for
certain non-financial remedies, including enhanced noticing obligations between the Utility and CPUC decision-makers, as well as certification of employee
training on the CPUC ex parte communication rules. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customers will bear no costs associated with the financial
remedies set forth above.

As a result of the CPUC's April 26, 2018 decision, on May 17, 2018, the Utility made a $12 million payment to the California General Fund and $6 million
payments to each of the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos. At December 31, 2018, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include a
$32 million accrual for a portion of the 2018 GT&S revenue requirement reduction. In accordance with accounting rules, adjustments related to revenue
requirements are recorded in the periods in which they are incurred.

The CPUC also ordered a second phase in this proceeding to determine if any of the additional communications that the Utility reported to the CPUC on September
21, 2017, violate the CPUC ex parte rules. On May 22, 2018, the assigned ALJ issued a ruling requiring the parties to meet and confer to determine if an agreement
can be reached on the issues identified by the ALJ. On September 17, 2018, the parties submitted a joint status report indicating a settlement in principle could not
be reached. The ALJ will hold a prehearing conference with the parties to determine if evidentiary hearings are required. The Utility is unable to predict the timing
and outcome of the second phase in this proceeding.

Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in
connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed.

Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund

The FERC determines the amount of authorized revenue requirements, including the rate of return on electric transmission assets, that the Utility may collect in
rates in the TO rate case. The FERC typically authorizes the Utility to charge new rates based on the requested revenue requirement, subject to refund, before the
FERC has issued a final decision. The Utility bills and records revenue based on the amounts requested in its rate case filing and records a reserve for its estimate
of the amounts that are probable of refund. Rates subject to refund went into effect on March 1, 2017, and March 1, 2018, for TO18 and TO19, respectively. Rates
subject to refund for TO20 will go into effect on May 1, 2019.

159

On October 1, 2018, the ALJ issued an initial decision in the TO18 rate case and the Utility filed initial briefs on October 31, 2018, in response to the ALJ's
recommendations. The Utility expects the FERC to issue a decision in the TO18 rate case by mid-2019, however, that decision will likely be the subject of requests
for rehearing and appeal. The Utility is unable to predict the timing of when a final decision will be issued. On September 21, 2018, the Utility filed an all-party
settlement with FERC in connection with TO19. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for
TO18 that will be determined in the TO18 final decision. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of FERC’s decisions in these proceedings.

Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Rights-of-Way

In 2012, the Utility notified the CPUC and the SED that the Utility planned to complete a system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines in an effort to address a
self-reported violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility’s pipeline
rights-of-way. The Utility also submitted a proposed compliance plan that set forth the scope and timing of remedial work to remove identified encroachments over
a multi-year period and to pay penalties if the proposed milestones were not met. In March 2014, the Utility informed the SED that the survey had been completed
and that remediation work, including removal of the encroachments, was expected to continue for several years. The SED has not addressed the Utility’s proposed
compliance plan, and it is reasonably possible that the SED will impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility’s failure to continuously survey its
system and remove encroachments. The Utility is unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of future charges that could be incurred given the SED’s wide
discretion and the number of factors that can be considered in determining penalties.

Other Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims, lawsuits and regulatory proceedings that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for
contingencies related to such matters (excluding amounts related to the contingencies discussed in Note 13 and above under “Enforcement and Litigation Matters”)
totaled $98 million at December 31, 2018 and $86 million at December 31, 2017 .  These amounts are included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material effect on their
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

2015 GT&S Rate Case Disallowance of Capital Expenditures

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case.  The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696
million of capital spending in 2011 through 2014 in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million
of that amount and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek
recovery in a future proceeding. The decision also established various cost caps that will increase the risk of overspend over the current rate case cycle including
new one-way balancing accounts. As a result, in 2016, the Utility incurred charges of $219 million for capital expenditures that the Utility believes are probable of
disallowance based on the decision. This included $134 million for 2011 through 2014 capital expenditures in excess of adopted amounts and $44 million for the
Utility’s estimate of 2015 through 2018 capital expenditures that are probable of exceeding authorized amounts. The Utility would be required to take a charge in
the future if the CPUC's audit of 2011 through 2014 capital spending resulted in additional permanent disallowance. The audit is still in process.

Environmental Remediation Contingencies

Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for
estimating remediation liabilities requires significant judgment. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate that
remediation is probable and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability
based on the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Key factors that
inform the development of estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities,
post-remediation monitoring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Amounts recorded are not discounted to their
present value. The Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprised
of the following:

(in millions)

Topock natural gas compressor station

Hinkley natural gas compressor station
Former manufactured gas plant sites owned by the Utility or third parties (1)

Utility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired),
  other facilities, and third-party disposal sites (2)
Fossil fuel-fired generation facilities and sites (3)

(1) Primarily driven by the following sites: Vallejo, San Francisco East Harbor, Napa, and San Francisco North Beach.
(2) Primarily driven by Geothermal landfill and Shell Pond site.
(3) Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.

The Utility’s gas compressor stations, former manufactured gas plant sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage,
recycling, and disposal of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the EPA under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act in addition to other state hazardous waste laws.  The Utility has a comprehensive program in place designed to comply with federal, state, and local laws and
regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors the
environmental requirements on an ongoing basis, and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate. The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen
by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.

The Utility’s environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2018 , reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the current
assessment data and regulatory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans
and the Utility's time frame for remediation.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could
have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded. At December 31, 2018 ,
the Utility expected to recover $930 million of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the
CPUC.

Natural Gas Compressor Station Sites

The Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas
compressor stations. The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.

161

Topock Site

The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California DTSC and the U.S. Department of the
Interior. On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and
non-soluble form of chromium. Construction activities began in October 2018 and will continue for several years. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs
associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $303 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The
costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered
in rates.

Hinkley Site

The Utility has been implementing remediation measures at the Hinkley site to reduce the mass of the chromium plume in groundwater and to monitor and control
movement of the plume. The Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region. In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up and
abatement order directing the Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts. The final
order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take other action. Additionally,
the final order sets plume capture requirements, requires a monitoring and reporting program, and includes deadlines for the Utility to meet interim cleanup targets.
The United States Geological Survey team is currently conducting a background study on the site to better define the chromium plume boundaries. The background
study is expected to be finalized in 2019. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as $141 million if the
extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Hinkley site will not be
recovered through rates.

Former Manufactured Gas Plants

Former MGPs used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available. The by-products and residues of this process
were often disposed of at the MGPs themselves. The Utility has undertaken a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process;
many of the sites in the program have been addressed. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $518 million
if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP sites are
recovered through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates.

Utility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Party Disposal Sites

Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with
Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $135 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation
is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recovered
through the HSM, where 90% of the costs are recovered in rates.

162

Fossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites

In 1998, the Utility divested its generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation. Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the
Utility retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generation
sites may increase by as much as $105 million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated. The environmental remediation
costs associated with the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.

Insurance

Wildfire Insurance

In 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for
the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of  $10 million
 per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million
through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. Various coverage limitations applicable to different insurance layers could result in
substantial uninsured costs in the future depending on the amount and type of damages.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage has increased to $360 million , compared to the adopted approximately $50
million that the Utility is currently recovering through rates through December 31, 2019. The Utility intends to seek recovery for the full amount of premium costs
paid in excess of the amount the Utility currently is recovering from customers through the end of the current GRC period, which ends on December 31, 2019.

Nuclear Insurance

The Utility is a member of NEIL, which is a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities.  NEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and
business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon and the retired
Humboldt Bay Unit 3. NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $3.2 billion per nuclear incident and $2.6 billion per non-
nuclear incident for Diablo Canyon.  Humboldt Bay Unit 3 has up to $131 million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.

NEIL also provides coverage for damages caused by acts of terrorism at nuclear power plants.  Certain acts of terrorism may be “certified” by the Secretary of the
Treasury.  If damages are caused by certified acts of terrorism, NEIL can obtain reimbursement from the federal government up to a shared limit of $3.2 billion for
each insured loss for NEIL members.  In contrast, for acts of terrorism not deemed "certified" by the Secretary of the Treasury, NEIL treats all non-certified
terrorist acts occurring within a 12-month period against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL as one event and the owners of the
affected plants would share a $3.2 billion policy limit amount.

In addition to the nuclear insurance the Utility maintains through the NEIL, the Utility also is a member of the EMANI, which provides excess insurance coverage
for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at Diablo Canyon. EMANI provides
$200 million for any one accident and in the annual aggregate excess of the combined amount recoverable under the Utility’s NEIL policies

If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment,
as of December 31, 2018 , the current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $47 million .  If
EMANI losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment of approximately $3 million , as of
December 31, 2018 .

Under the Price-Anderson Act, public liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at Diablo Canyon, and that occur during the transportation of
material to and from Diablo Canyon are limited to $14.1 billion .  The Utility purchased the maximum available public liability insurance of $450 million for
Diablo Canyon.  The balance of the $14.1 billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among utilities owning nuclear reactors.  The
Utility may be assessed up to $275 million per nuclear incident under this program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of $41 million per incident.
Both the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years .

163

The Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to a
fuel fabricator or that occur at the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents
up to a maximum of $450 million per incident.  In addition, the Utility has $53 million of liability insurance for Humboldt Bay Unit 3 and has a $500 million
indemnification from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for Humboldt Bay Unit 3, covering liabilities in excess of the $53 million in
liability insurance.

Resolution of Remaining 2001 Chapter 11 Disputed Claims

Various electricity suppliers filed claims in the Utility’s 2001 prior proceeding filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking payment for energy
supplied to the Utility’s customers between May 2000 and June 2001.  While the FERC and judicial proceedings are pending, the Utility pursued settlements with
electricity suppliers and entered into a number of settlement agreements with various electricity suppliers to resolve some of these disputed claims and to resolve
the Utility’s refund claims against these electricity suppliers. Under these settlement agreements, amounts payable by the parties, in some instances, would be
subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the various refund offset and interest issues being considered by the FERC. Generally, any net refunds, claim
offsets, or other credits that the Utility receives from electricity suppliers either through settlement or through the conclusion of the various FERC and judicial
proceedings are refunded to customers through rates in future periods.

At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected $ 220 million and $ 243 million in net claims within
Disputed claims and customer refunds related to the 2001 Chapter 11 proceeding.  The Utility's obligations with respect to such claims (all of which arose prior to
the initiation of the Utility's pending Chapter 11 Case on January 29, 2019), including pursuant to any prior settlements relating thereto, are expected to be
determined through the proceedings of the Chapter 11 Cases.

Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assign or reject certain executory contracts and
unexpired leases, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and satisfaction of certain other conditions. (For more information see "Chapter 11 Proceedings"
in Note 15 below.)

Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, QF agreements, and other power purchase
agreements to purchase power and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the current
market price of either natural gas or electricity at the date of delivery.

164

Renewable
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

In order to comply with California’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to its
customers at a gradually increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement. The
Utility’s obligations under a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expected
to grow.  As of December 31, 2018 , renewable energy contracts expire at various dates between 2019 and 2043 .

Conventional
Energy
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered into many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, which
include tolling agreements and resource adequacy agreements.  The Utility’s obligation under a portion of these agreements is contingent on the third parties’
development of new generation facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility. As of December 31, 2018 , these power purchase agreements
expire at various dates between 2019 and 2033 .

Other
Power
Purchase
Agreements.

The Utility has entered into agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that own
generation facilities that meet the definition of a QF under federal law.  Two of these agreements are treated as capital leases.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017 ,
net capital leases reflected in property, plant, and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $11 million and $18 million including accumulated
amortization of $8 million and $143 million , respectively.  The present value of the future minimum lease payments due under these agreements included $2
million and $11 million in Current Liabilities and $9 million and $7 million in Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. As of
December 31, 2018 , QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 2019 and 2049 .  In addition, the Utility has agreements with various irrigation
districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.

The costs incurred for all power purchases and electric capacity amounted to $3.1 billion in 2018 , $3.3 billion in 2017 , and $3.5 billion in 2016 .

Natural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments

The Utility purchases natural gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers and to fuel its owned-
generation facilities.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the US Rocky
Mountain supply area, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire at
various dates between 2019 and 2026 .  In addition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in northern California to more reliably meet
customers’ loads.

Costs incurred for natural gas purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year,
amounted to $0.6 billion in 2018 , $0.9 billion in 2017 , and $0.7 billion in 2016 .

Nuclear Fuel Agreements

The Utility has entered into several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2019 and 2024 and are intended to
ensure long-term nuclear fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide security
of supply.  Pricing terms are also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices.

Payments for nuclear fuel amounted to $73 million in 2018 , $83 million in 2017 , and $100 million in 2016 .

165

Other Commitments

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have other commitments related to operating leases (primarily office facilities and land), which expire at various dates between
2019 and 2052 .  At December 31, 2018 , the future minimum payments related to these commitments were as follows:

Payments for other commitments related to operating leases amounted to $43 million in 2018 , $45 million in 2017 , and $43 million in 2016 .  Certain leases on
office facilities contain escalation clauses requiring annual increases in rent.  The rentals payable under these leases may increase by a fixed amount each year, a
percentage of increase over base year, or the consumer price index.  Most leases contain extension operations ranging between one and five years .
NOTE 15: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On the Petition Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. PG&E Corporation's and the
Utility’s Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088
(DM).

PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As debtors in possession, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are
authorized to continue to operate as ongoing businesses, and may pay all debts and honor all obligations arising in the ordinary course of their businesses after the
Petition Date. However, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may not pay third-party claims or creditors on account of obligations arising before the Petition Date or
engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, third-party actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness owed by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, as well as most litigation pending
against PG&E Corporation and the Utility (including the third-party matters described in Note 13 above), are subject to an automatic stay. Absent an order of the
Bankruptcy Court providing otherwise, substantially all pre-petition liabilities will be administered under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization to be voted upon by
creditors and other stakeholders, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. However, under the Bankruptcy Code, regulatory or criminal proceedings are generally
not subject to an automatic stay, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect these proceedings to continue during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.

To assure ordinary course operations, on January 31, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of
“first day” motions, including motions that authorize them to maintain their existing cash management system, to continue wage and salary payments and other
benefits to their employees, to secure debtor in possession financing and other customary relief. On February 27, 2019, PG&E Corporation and the Utility received
final approval of the first day motion to continue wage and salary payments and other benefits to their employees (with one limited objection with respect to a
discrete matter having been preserved by the Bankruptcy Court) and certain other first day motions for customary relief. Hearings on certain other first day
motions, including a hearing to consider final approval of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s motions to continue their existing cash management system and to
approve their debtor in possession financing, have not been held and no assurances can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will approve such motions on a final
basis. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing with respect to such motions, but there are hearings currently scheduled
for March 12, March 13 and March 27, 2019.

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&E Corporation and the Utility entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. See Note 4 above for a description of the DIP
Credit Agreement.

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default or termination event, and caused an automatic and immediate acceleration of the
Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations. Accordingly, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal amount of the Accelerated Direct
Financial Obligations, together with accrued interest thereon, and in case of certain indebtedness, premium, if any, thereon, immediately became due and payable.
However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as of the Petition Date, and are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The material Accelerated Direct Financial Obligations include the outstanding senior notes, agreements in
respect of certain series of pollution control bonds, and PG&E Corporation's term loan facility, as well as short-term borrowings under PG&E Corporation's and
the Utility's revolving credit facilities and the Utility's term loan facility disclosed in Note 4 above. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases may also provide the
counterparties under certain commodity and related agreements with the right to declare an event of default and to seek termination of such rights subject to the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, certain post-petition and secured or “priority” pre-petition liabilities need to be satisfied before
general unsecured creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation's and the Utility’s equity are entitled to receive any distribution. No assurance can be given as to
what values, if any, will be ascribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to the claims and interests of each of these constituencies. Additionally, no assurance can be given as
to whether, when or in what form unsecured creditors and holders of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s equity may receive a distribution on such claims or
interests.

166

Under the Bankruptcy Code, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,
including, without limitation, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Any
description of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunder
or a quantification of their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights PG&E Corporation and the Utility have
under the Bankruptcy Code.

As of February 28, 2019, the Utility had outstanding borrowings of $ 350 million under the DIP Revolving Facility and $30 million in face amount of outstanding
letters of credit, with remaining availability of $ 1.12 billion under the DIP Revolving Facility.

US District Court Matters and Probation

On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San
Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management
regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced the
Utility to a 5 -year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after 3
years, a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service.

The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility
has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility’s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate
steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide
basis.

On November 27, 2018, the court overseeing the Utility’s probation, issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern
District of California (the “USAO”) and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility’s compliance with the terms
of its probation, including what requirements of the Utility’s probation “might be implicated were any wildfire started by reckless operation or maintenance of
PG&E power lines” or “might be implicated by any inaccurate, slow, or failed reporting of information about any wildfire by PG&E.”  The court also ordered the
Utility to provide “an accurate and complete statement of the role, if any, of PG&E in causing and reporting the recent 2018 Camp fire in Butte County and all
other wildfires in California” since January 2017 (“Question 4 of the November 27 Order”).  On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the
Office of the California Attorney General advise the court of its view on “the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&E power lines
would constitute a crime under California law.”  The responses of the Attorney General were submitted on December 28, 2018, and the responses of the Utility, the
USAO and the third-party monitor were submitted on December 31, 2018.

On January 3, 2019, the court issued a new order requiring that the Utility provide further information regarding the Atlas fire.  The court noted that “[t]his order
postpones the question of the adequacy of PG&E’s response” to Question 4 of the November 27 Order.  On January 4, 2019, the court issued another order
requiring that the Utility provide “with respect to each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that [Cal Fire] has attributed to [the Utility’s]
facilities,” information regarding the wind conditions in the vicinity of each fire’s origin and information about the equipment allegedly involved in each fire’s
ignition.  The responses of the Utility were submitted on January 10, 2019.

167

On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court’s finding that “there is probable cause to believe
there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision” with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire.  In addition, on January 9, 2019,
the court issued an order (the “January 9 Order”) proposing to add new conditions of probation that would require the Utility, among other things, to:

•

•

•

prior to June 21, 2019, “re-inspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines, poles or equipment in high-wind
conditions, . . . identify and fix all conductors that might swing together and arc due to slack and/or other circumstances under high-wind conditions[,]
identify and fix damaged or weakened poles, transformers, fuses and other connectors [and] identify and fix any other condition anywhere in its grid
similar to any condition that contributed to any previous wildfires”,

“document the foregoing inspections and the work done and . . . rate each segment’s safety under various wind conditions” and

at all times from and after June 21, 2019, “supply electricity only through those parts of its electrical grid it has determined to be safe under the wind
conditions then prevailing.”

The Utility was ordered to show cause by January 23, 2019, as to why the Utility’s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility's
response was submitted on January 23, 2019. The court requested that Cal Fire file a public statement, and invited the CPUC to comment, by January 25, 2019. On

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&E
Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—
Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria,
management has concluded that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal
Control
 — Integrated
Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
PG&E Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the
Company’s related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2018, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the
financial statements, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp wildfire may result in material losses to the Company, which contributed to the
Company’s decision to voluntarily file for bankruptcy as discussed below. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty .

Bankruptcy Proceedings

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, on January 29, 2019, the Company has voluntarily filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular,
such financial statements do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-
petition liabilities, the settlement amounts for allowed claims, or the status and priority thereof; (3) as to shareholder accounts, the effect of any changes that may
be made in the capitalization of the Company; or (4) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in its business.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the

Arbitration. With the exception of any request for specific performance , injunctive or other equitable relief , any dispute or controversy of
any kind arising out of or related to this Agreement , Mr. Hogan ' s employment with the Company (or with the employing subsidiary) , the separation of Mr.
Hogan from that employment and from his positions as an officer and/or director of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate , or any claims for benefits, rights
under , or interpretation of this Agreement , will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration using one arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect, prov i ded , howe v er, that in rendering their award , the arbitrators will be limited
to those legal rights and remedies provided for by law. The only claims not covered by this paragraph are any non-waivable claims for benefits under workers'
compensation  or  unemployment  insurance  laws,  which  will  be  resolved  under  those  laws  . Any  arbitration  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  will  take  place  in  San
Francisco , California. The Parties may be represented by legal counsel at the arbitration but must bear their own fees for such representation in the first instance.
The  prevailing  party  in  any  dispute  or  controversy  covered  by  this  paragraph  , or  with  respect  to  any  request  for  specific  performance  , injunctive  or  other
equitable relief in any forum , will be entitled to recover, in addition to any other available remedies specified in this Agreement, all litigation expenses and costs ,
including any arbitrator, administrative or filing fees and reasonable attorneys' fees , except as prohibited or limited by law. The Parties specifically waive any
right  to  a  jury  trial  on  any  dispute  or  controversy  covered  by  this  paragraph.  Judgment  may  be  entered  on  the  arbitrators'  award  in  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction. Subject to the arbitration provisions of this paragraph , the sole jurisdiction and venue for any action related to the subject matter of this Agreement
will be the California state and federal courts having within their jurisdiction the location of the Corporation's principal place of business in California at the time
of such action , and both Parties thereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts for any such action.

16.

Governing law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States and, to the extent not preempted by

such laws, by the laws of the State of California, without regard to their conflicts of laws provisions.

17.

No waiver. The failure of either Party to exercise or enforce , at any time , or for any period of time , any of the provisions of this Agreement
will  not  be  construed  as  a  waiver  of  that  provision,  or  any  portion  of  that  provision  , and  will  in  no  way  affect  that  party's  right to exercise  or enforce  such
provisions. No waiver or default of any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provisions
of this Agreement.

The LTIP and Other
Agreements

This Agreement and the above cover sheet constitute the entire understanding between you and PG&E Corporation
regarding  the  Restricted  Stock  Units,  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  LTIP.  Any  prior  agreements,  commitments,  or
negotiations are superseded. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement or

Grant of Restricted Stock
Units

PG&E Corporation grants you the number of Restricted Stock Units shown on the cover sheet of this Agreement. The
Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LTIP.

Vesting of Restricted Stock
Units

As  long  as  you  remain  employed  with  PG&E  Corporation,  the  total  number  of  Restricted  Stock  Units  originally
subject to this Agreement, as shown on the cover sheet, will vest in accordance with the below vesting schedule (the
“Normal Vesting Schedule”).

3,381 on December 03, 2019

3,381 on December 03, 2020

3,382 on December 03, 2021

Dividends

Settlement

The amounts payable upon each vesting date are hereby designated separate payments for purposes of Section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”). Except as described below, all Restricted Stock Units
subject to this Agreement which have not vested upon termination of your employment will then be cancelled. As set
forth below, the Restricted Stock Units may vest earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.

Restricted  Stock  Units  will  accrue  Dividend  Equivalents  in  the  event  that  cash  dividends  are  paid  with  respect  to
PG&E  Corporation  common  stock  having  a  record  date  prior  to  the  date  on  which  the  RSUs  are  settled.  Such
Dividend  Equivalents  will  be  converted  into  cash  and  paid,  if  at  all,  upon  settlement  of  the  underlying  Restricted
Stock Units.

Vested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be  settled  in  an  equal  number  of  shares  of  PG&E  Corporation  common  stock,
subject to the satisfaction of Withholding Taxes, as described below. PG&E Corporation will issue shares as soon as
practicable after the Restricted Stock Units vest in accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule (but not later than
sixty (60) days after the applicable vesting date); provided, however, that such issuance will, if earlier, be made with
respect to all of your outstanding vested Restricted Stock Units (after giving effect to the vesting provisions described
below) as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the earliest to occur of your (1) Disability
(as  defined  under  Code  Section  409A),  (2)  death,  or  (3)  “separation  from  service,”  within  the  meaning  of  Code
Section 409A within 2 years following a Change in Control.

Voluntary Termination

In  the  event  of  your  voluntary  termination  (other  than  Retirement),  all  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be
cancelled on the date of termination.

Retirement - I  (2)

Retirement - II  (3)

Termination for Cause

Termination other than for
Cause

Death/Disability

Termination Due to
Disposition of Subsidiary

In the event of your Retirement, unvested Restricted Stock Units will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the
Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement
provisions  of  this  Agreement;  provided,  however  that  in  the  event  of  your  Retirement  within  2  years  following  a
Change in Control, all of your Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later
than  sixty  (60)  days  after)  the  date  of  such  Retirement.  Your  termination  of  employment  will  be  considered
Retirement if you are age 55 or older on the date of termination (other than termination for cause) and if you were
employed  by  PG&E  Corporation  for  at  least  five  consecutive  years  ending  on  the  date  of  termination  of  your
employment.

In the event of your Retirement, any unvested Restricted Stock Units that would have vested within the 12 months
following  such  Retirement  had  your  employment  continued  will  continue  to  vest  and  be  settled  pursuant  to  the
Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement
provisions  of  this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  event  of  your  Retirement  within  2  years  following  a
Change in Control, those Restricted Stock Units that would have vested within 12 months following such Retirement
will be vested and settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than 60 days after) the date of such Retirement.
All  other  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be  cancelled.  Your  termination  of  employment  will  be  considered
Retirement if you are age 55 or older on the date of termination (other than termination for cause) and if you were
employed  by  PG&E  Corporation  for  at  least  eight  consecutive  years  ending  on  the  date  of  termination  of  your
employment.

If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated at any time by PG&E Corporation for cause, all unvested
Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be  cancelled  on  the  date  of  termination.  In  general,  termination  for  “cause”  means
termination  of  employment  because  of  dishonesty,  a  criminal  offense,  or  violation  of  a  work  rule,  and  will  be
determined by and in the sole discretion of PG&E Corporation. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not be eligible to
retire if your employment is being or is terminated for cause.

If your employment with PG&E Corporation is terminated by PG&E Corporation other than for cause or Retirement,
any  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  that  would  have  vested  within  the  12  months  following  such  termination  had
your employment continued will continue to vest and be settled pursuant to the Normal Vesting Schedule (without
regard to the requirement that you be employed), subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement. All
other  unvested  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be  cancelled  unless  your  termination  of  employment  was  in  connection
with a Change in Control as provided below.

In  the  event  of  your  death  or  Disability  (as  defined  in  Code  Section  409A)  while  you  are  employed,  all  of  your
Restricted Stock Units will vest and be settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the
date  of  such  event.  If  your  death  or  Disability  occurs  following  the  termination  of  your  employment  and  your
Restricted Stock Units are then outstanding under the terms hereof, then all of your vested Restricted Stock Units plus
any Restricted Stock Units that would have otherwise vested during any continued vesting period hereunder will be
settled as soon as practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of your death or Disability.

If  your  employment  is  terminated  (other  than  for  cause,  or  your  voluntary  termination,  or  your  Retirement)  (1)  by
reason  of  a  divestiture  or  change  in  control  of  a  subsidiary  of  PG&E  Corporation,  which  divestiture  or  change  in
control results in such subsidiary no longer qualifying as a subsidiary corporation under Code Section 424(f), or (2)
coincident  with  the  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  a  subsidiary  of  PG&E  Corporation,  then  your
Restricted  Stock  Units  will  vest  and  be  settled  in  the  same  manner  as  for  a  “Termination  other  than  for  Cause”
described above.

(2) “Retirement -I” provisions apply to any recipients who were in a director level or higher position on May 5, 2017 and who received an LTIP award prior to 2017.
 (3) “Retirement - II” provisions apply to all other recipients.

Change in Control

In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business
entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the “Acquiror ”
), may, without your consent, either assume or continue
PG&E  Corporation’s  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  provide  a  substantially  equivalent  award  in
substitution for the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement.

Termination In Connection
with a Change in Control

Delay

Withholding Taxes

If  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  are  neither  so  assumed  nor  so  continued  by  the  Acquiror,  and  the  Acquiror  does  not
provide a substantially equivalent award in substitution for the Restricted Stock Units, all of your unvested Restricted
Stock Units will vest immediately preceding and contingent on, the Change in Control and be settled in accordance
with the Normal Vesting Schedule, subject to the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.

If you separate from service (other than termination for cause, or your voluntary termination, or your Retirement) in
connection  with  a  Change  in  Control  within  three  months  before  the  Change  in  Control  occurs,  all  of  your
outstanding  Restricted  Stock Units  (including  Restricted  Stock Units that  you would have otherwise  forfeited  after
the  end  of  the  continued  vesting  period)  will  vest  on  the  date  of  the  Change  in  Control  and  will  be  settled  in
accordance with the Normal Vesting Schedule (without regard to the requirement that you be employed) subject to
the earlier settlement provisions of this Agreement.

In the event of such a separation in connection with a Change in Control within two years following the Change in
Control,  your  Restricted  Stock  Units  (to  the  extent  they  did  not  previously  vest  upon,  for  example,  failure  of  the
Acquiror  to  assume  or  continue  this  award)  will  vest  on  the  date  of  such  separation  and  will  be  settled  as  soon  as
practicable after (but not later than sixty (60) days after) the date of such separation. PG&E Corporation has the sole
discretion to determine whether termination of your employment was made in connection with a Change in Control.

PG&E Corporation will delay the issuance of any shares of common stock to the extent it is necessary to comply with
Code  Section  409A(a)(2)(B)(i)  (relating  to  payments  made  to  certain  “key  employees”  of  certain  publicly-traded
companies); in such event, any shares of common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled during the six (6)
month period following the date of your “separation from service” under Section 409A (or shorter period ending on
the  date  of  your  death  following  such  separation)  will  instead  be  issued  on  the  first  business  day  following  the
expiration of the applicable delay period.

The number of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock that you are otherwise entitled to receive upon settlement
of  Restricted  Stock  Units  will  be  reduced  by  a  number  of  shares  having  an  aggregate  Fair  Market  Value,  as
determined by PG&E Corporation, equal to the amount of any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by
law  to  be  withheld  by  PG&E  Corporation  in  connection  with  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  using  the
applicable minimum statutory withholding rates, including social security and Medicare taxes due under the Federal
Insurance Contributions Act and the California State Disability Insurance tax (“Withholding Taxes”). If the withheld
shares  were  not  sufficient  to  satisfy  your  minimum  Withholding  Taxes,  you  will  be  required  to  pay,  as  soon  as
practicable,  including  through  additional  payroll  withholding,  any  amount  of  the  Withholding  Taxes  that  is  not
satisfied by the withholding of shares described above.

Leaves of Absence

Voting and Other Rights

No Retention Rights

Recoupment of Awards

For purposes of this Agreement, if you are on an approved leave of absence from PG&E Corporation, or a recipient
of PG&E Corporation sponsored disability benefits, you will continue to be considered as employed. If you do not
return  to  active  employment  upon  the  expiration  of  your  leave  of  absence  or  the  expiration  of  your  PG&E
Corporation sponsored disability benefits,  you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated  your employment.
See above under “Voluntary Termination.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the leave of absence exceeds six (6) months, and a return to service upon expiration
of  such  leave  is  not  guaranteed  by  statute  or  contract,  then  you  will  be  deemed  to  have  had  a  “separation  from
service” for purposes of any Restricted Stock Units that are settled hereunder upon such separation. To the extent an
authorized leave of absence is due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to
result  in  death  or  to  last  for  a  continuous  period  of  at  least  six  (6)  months  and  such  impairment  causes  you  to  be
unable to perform the duties of your position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, the
six (6) month period in the prior sentence will be twenty-nine (29) months.

PG&E  Corporation  reserves  the  right  to  determine  which  leaves  of  absence  will  be  considered  as  continuing
employment and when your employment terminates for all purposes under this Agreement.

You  will  not  have  voting  rights  with  respect  to  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  until  the  date  the  underlying  shares  are
issued (as evidenced by appropriate entry on the books of PG&E Corporation or its duly authorized transfer agent).
No  Restricted  Stock  Units  and  no  shares  of  Stock  that  have  not  been  issued  hereunder  may  be  sold,  assigned,
transferred,  pledged,  or  otherwise  encumbered,  other  than  by  will  or  the  laws  of  decent  and  distribution,  and  the
Restricted  Stock  Units  may  be  exercised  during  the  life  of  the  Recipient  only  by  the  Recipient  or  the  Recipient’s
guardian or legal representative.

This  Agreement  is  not  an  employment  agreement  and  does  not  give  you  the  right  to  be  retained  by  PG&E
Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in an applicable employment agreement, PG&E Corporation reserves the
right to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason.

Awards are subject to recoupment in accordance with any applicable law and any recoupment policy adopted by the
Corporation from time to time, including the PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Executive
Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, as last revised on February 21, 2018 and available on the PG&E@Work
internet site for the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the policy and location may be changed from time to time by PG&E
