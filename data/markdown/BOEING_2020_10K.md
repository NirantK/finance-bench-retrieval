Item 1. Business

PART I

The Boeing Company, together with its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”),  is one of the world’s major
aerospace firms.

We are organized based on the products and services we offer. We operate in four reportable segments:

•

•

Commercial Airplanes (BCA);

Defense, Space & Security (BDS);

• Global Services (BGS);

•

Boeing Capital (BCC).

Commercial Airplanes Segment

This  segment  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  and  provides  fleet  support  services,  principally  to  the  commercial  airline
industry worldwide. We are a leading producer of commercial aircraft and offer a family of commercial jetliners designed to meet a broad spectrum
of global passenger and cargo requirements of airlines. This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and
the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Development continues on the 777X program and certain 737 MAX derivatives.

Defense, Space & Security Segment

This segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems
for  strike,  surveillance  and  mobility,  including  fighter  and  trainer  aircraft;  vertical  lift,  including  rotorcraft  and  tilt-rotor  aircraft;  and  commercial
derivative  aircraft,  including  anti-submarine  and  tanker  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment  engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  and
modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  including  strategic  missile  and  defense
systems,  command,  control,  communications,  computers,  intelligence, surveillance  and reconnaissance  (C4ISR),  cyber and information  solutions,
and intelligence systems; satellite systems, including government and commercial satellites and space exploration.

BDS'  primary  customer  is  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (U.S.  DoD).  Revenues  from  the  U.S.  DoD,  including  foreign  military  sales
through  the  U.S.  government,  accounted  for  approximately  83%  of  its  2020  revenues.  Other  significant  BDS  customers  include  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and customers in international defense, civil and commercial satellite markets.

This segment's primary products include the following fixed-wing military aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A
Tanker,  and  T-7A  Red  Hawk.  This  segment  produces  rotorcraft  and  rotary-wing  programs,  such  as  CH-47  Chinook,  AH-64  Apache,  and  V-22
Osprey.  Unmanned  vehicles  include  the  MQ-25,  QF-16,  and  Insitu’s  Scan  Eagle  aircraft.  In  addition,  this  segment's  products  include  space  and
missile  systems  including:  government  and  commercial  satellites,  NASA’s  Space  Launch  System  (SLS),  the  International  Space  Station,
Commercial Crew, missile defense and weapons programs, and Joint Direct Attack Munition, as well as the United Launch Alliance joint venture.

Table of Contents

Global Services Segment

This segment provides services to our commercial and defense customers  worldwide. BGS sustains aerospace platforms and systems with a full
spectrum of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and
conversions,  spare  parts,  pilot  and  maintenance  training  systems  and  services,  technical  and  maintenance  documents,  and  data  analytics  and
digital services.

Boeing Capital Segment

BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product, while managing overall
financing  exposure.  BCC’s portfolio  consists  of equipment  under operating  leases,  sales-type/finance  leases,  notes  and other  receivables,  assets
held for sale or re-lease and investments.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition
to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government
has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance  of government contracts,  and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions
covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade
secrets,  and  other  intellectual  property  rights,  also  make  an  important  contribution  to  our  business.  While  our  intellectual  property  rights  in  the
aggregate  are  important  to  the  operation  of  each  of  our  businesses,  we  do  not  believe  that  our  business  would  be  materially  affected  by  the
expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.

Human Capital

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and
safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. A vast majority of our office workers continue to telecommute. Within our production and
office  areas  we  have  established  a  number  of  safety  protocols,  including  face  covering  and  physical  distance  requirements,  enhanced  cleaning,
encouraging daily self-health checks, voluntary temperature screening stations, and access to virtual primary care physicians at no cost. We have
also  implemented  a  coronavirus  hotline  with  direct  access  to  our  Health  Services  group  to  report  COVID-19  tests  due  to  illness  or  exposure  and
positive COVID-19 tests. As part of that reporting process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify employees who were in
close contact with the ill employee in the workplace. We are also actively planning for the time when COVID-19 vaccines will be available for our
employees,  including  reaching  out  to  county  public  health  departments  to  learn  more  about  their  plans  to  distribute  vaccines  and  monitoring
information  from  vaccine  manufacturers  about  when  vaccines  will  be  available.  All  of  the  actions  above  are  overseen  by  Boeing’s  Crisis
Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Boeing’s COVID-19 response.

Additionally,  we  are  adapting  to  the  market  impacts  of  COVID-19  and  positioning  the  company  for  the  future.  One  of  these  measures  includes
reducing the size of our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, Boeing’s total workforce was approximately 141,000, with 11% located outside of the
U.S. We expect to reduce the size of our workforce in 2021 through additional workforce actions as well as natural attrition.

Status of the Agreements with Major Union

We have two major agreements; one expiring in July 2022 and
one in September 2024.
We have two major agreements expiring in October 2026.

We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022.

We aspire to be the most equitable, diverse and inclusive company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone
is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all
levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. We also support Business Resource
Groups open to all employees that focus on gender, race & ethnicity,  generations, gender identity, sexual orientation,  disability or veteran status.
These  groups  help  foster  inclusion  among  all  teammates,  build  awareness,  recruit  and  retain  a  diverse  workforce  and  support  the  company  in
successfully  operating  in  a  global,  multicultural  business  environment.  We  are  committed  to  increased  transparency  and  will  publicly  share  our
diversity metrics annually, beginning in 2021.

To attract and retain the best-qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off,
parental  leave,  retirement  benefits,  tuition  assistance,  employee  skills  development,  leadership  development,  and rotation  programs.  In 2020, our
voluntary resignation rate was approximately 3%. Additionally, we hired approximately 8,000 new employees in 2020 for critical skills and had an
offer acceptance rate of 82%.

Employees are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through ongoing employee engagement activities. Boeing actively listens to
its employees via surveys ranging from pre-hire to exiting the company. These voluntary surveys provide aggregate trend reports for the company to
address in real time and ensure Boeing maintains an employee-focused experience and culture. We also invest in rewarding performance and have
established a multi-level recognition program for the purpose of acknowledging the achievements of excellent individual or team performance.

We  are  committed  to  supporting  our  employees  continuous  development  of  professional,  technical  and  leadership  skills  through  access  to  digital
learning  resources  and  through  partnerships  with  leading  professional/technical  societies  and  organizations  around  the  world.  For  2020,  Boeing
employees  consumed  approximately  4  million  hours  of  learning.  We  offer  the  ability  for  our  people  to  pursue  degree  programs,  professional
certificates and individual courses in strategic fields of study from more than 300 accredited colleges and universities, online and across the globe
through our tuition assistance program. Over 12,000 Boeing employees leverage these programs every year.

Safety,  quality  and  integrity  are  at  the  core  of  how  Boeing  operates.  We  aspire  to  achieve  zero  workplace  injuries  and  provide  a  safe,  open  and
accountable  work  environment  for  our  employees.  We  provide  several  channels  for  all  employees  to  speak  up,  ask  for  guidance,  and  report
concerns related

3

Table of Contents

to ethics or safety violations. We address employee concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Boeing values.

Competition

The  commercial  jet  aircraft  market  and  the  airline  industry  remain  extremely  competitive.  We  face  aggressive  international  competitors  who  are
intent  on  increasing  their  market  share,  such  as  Airbus  and  other  entrants  from  Russia,  China  and  Japan.  We  are  focused  on  improving  our
processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with
greater value products.

BDS  faces  strong  competition  in  all  market  segments,  primarily  from  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation,  Northrop  Grumman  Corporation,  Raytheon
Technologies Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to
build  a  strategic  presence  in  the  U.S.  market  by  strengthening  their  North  American  operations  and  partnering  with  U.S.  defense  companies.  In
addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. BDS expects the
trend of strong competition to continue into 2021.

The  commercial  and  defense  services  markets  are  extremely  challenging  and  are  made  up  of  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets. BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products
and  services  which  span  the  life  cycle  of  our  defense  and  commercial  airplane  programs:  training,  fleet  services  and  logistics,  maintenance  and
engineering,  modifications  and  upgrades  -  as  well  as  the  daily  cycle  of  gate-to-gate  operations.  BGS  expects  the  market  to  remain  highly
competitive in 2021, and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.

Regulatory Matters

Our  businesses  are  heavily  regulated  in  most  of  our  markets.  We  deal  with  numerous  U.S.  government  agencies  and  entities,  including  but  not
limited  to  all  of  the  branches  of  the  U.S.  military,  NASA,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.
Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.

Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well
as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for
convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our
government  contracts  were  to  be  terminated  for  default,  generally  the  U.S.  government  would  pay  only  for  the  work  that  has  been  accepted  and
could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from
the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.

Commercial Aircraft. In  the  U.S.,  our  commercial  aircraft  products  are  required  to  comply  with  FAA  regulations  governing  production  and  quality
systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist
for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each
country and, in the case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.

Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the
discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and

4

Table of Contents

remediation  of  hazardous  substances  and  wastes.  We  continually  assess  our  compliance  status  and  management  of  environmental  matters  to
ensure  our  operations  are  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Investigation,  remediation,  and  operation  and
maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs
often  are  allowable  costs  under  our  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  It  is  reasonably  possible  that  costs  incurred  to  ensure  continued
environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements
or  more  stringent  clean-up  standards  are  imposed  by  regulators,  new  areas  of  soil,  air  and  groundwater  contamination  are  discovered  and/or
expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.

A Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. Where we have been designated a PRP
by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost
of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for
which  we  were  originally  assigned  a  partial  share,  the  statutory  framework  would  allow  us  to  pursue  rights  to  contribution  from  other  PRPs.  For
additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-U.S.  Sales. Our  non-U.S.  sales  are  subject  to  both  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  governmental  regulations  and  procurement  policies  and  practices,
including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S.
sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.

Raw Materials, Parts, and Subassemblies

We  are  highly  dependent  on  the  availability  of  essential  materials,  parts  and  subassemblies  from  our  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  The  most
important  raw materials  required for  our aerospace products  are aluminum (sheet,  plate, forgings and extrusions),  titanium  (sheet,  plate, forgings
and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of
the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis
with a number of companies.

Suppliers

We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality
standards  and  delivery  schedules  at  our  anticipated  costs.  While  we  maintain  an  extensive  qualification  and  performance  surveillance  system  to
control  risk  associated  with  such  reliance  on  third  parties,  failure  of  suppliers  or  subcontractors  to  meet  commitments  could  adversely  affect
production  schedules  and  program/contract  profitability,  thereby  jeopardizing  our  ability  to  fulfill  commitments  to  our  customers.  We  are  also
dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report, as well as our annual report to shareholders, quarterly reports, and other filings we make with the SEC, press and earnings releases
and other written and oral communications, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of  1995.  Words  such  as  “may,”  “should,”  “expects,”  “intends,”  “projects,”  “plans,”  “believes,”  “estimates,”  “targets,”  “anticipates”  and  similar
expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements.  Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future
financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be
accurate.  These  statements  are  not  guarantees  and  are  subject  to  risks,  uncertainties  and  changes  in  circumstances  that  are  difficult  to  predict.
Many factors, including those set forth in the “Risk Factors” section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in
our  other  filings  with  the  SEC,  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  these  forward-looking  statements.  Any  forward-
looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Table of Contents

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially
from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information
contained in this report.

Risks Related to COVID-19

We face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had, and
will  continue  to  have,  significant  effects  on  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations,  and  cash  flows.  We  also  face
significant risks related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic. These
risks include materially reduced demand for our products and services, increased instability in our supply chain, and challenges to the
ongoing  viability  of  some  of  our  customers.  We  may  face  similar  risks  in  connection  with  any  future  public  health  crises,  including
resurgences in the spread of COVID-19.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  subjected  our  business,  operations,  financial  performance,  cash  flows  and  financial  condition  to  a  number  of  risks,
including, but not limited to those discussed below.

Operations-related  risks: As  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  are  facing  increased  operational  challenges  from  the  need  to  protect
employee health and safety. These challenges have included, and may in the future include production site shutdowns, and workplace disruptions
and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and those of our customers and suppliers.

For example, during the second quarter of 2020, we temporarily suspended operations in Puget Sound, South Carolina, and Philadelphia, as well as
at several other key production sites. We had not previously experienced a complete suspension of our operations at these production sites. While
we have resumed operations at all of our production sites we cannot predict whether or where further production disruptions could be required or
what the ongoing impact of COVID-19-related operating restrictions will be. For example, we continue to experience additional operating costs due
to social distancing requirements and other factors related to COVID-19 restrictions. We cannot predict the impact that future production disruptions
may have on our business, operations, financial performance  and financial condition. We continue to monitor  federal,  state,  and municipal health
authorities  for  new  or  modified  guidance  and  requirements  concerning  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  we  may  be  required  to  impose  additional
operational  restrictions  and/or  suspend  operations  at  key  production  sites  based  on  these  requirements  and  recommendations  and/or  workplace
disruptions caused by COVID-19.

Many of our suppliers also were required to suspend operations during the second quarter of 2020, and they may experience additional disruptions
in  2021.  Any  such  disruptions  could  have  severe  adverse  impacts  on  our  production  costs,  delivery  schedule  and/or  ability  to  meet  customer
commitments.

Any prolonged suspension of operations or delayed recovery in our operations, and/or any similar suspension of operations or delayed recovery at
one or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, leading to a further
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Liquidity  risks:  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  our  liquidity  and  overall  debt  levels.  During  the  year  ended
December 31, 2020, net cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion. At December 31, 2020, cash and short-term investments totaled $25.6
billion.  Our  debt  balance  totaled  $63.6  billion  at  December  31,  2020,  up  from  $27.3  billion  at  December  31,  2019.  We  expect  negative  operating
cash flows in future quarters until deliveries begin to return to historical levels, and if

7

Table of Contents

the  pace  and  scope  of  the  recovery  are  worse  than  we  currently  contemplate,  we  may  need  to  obtain  additional  financing  in  order  to  fund  our
operations  and  obligations.  If  we  were  to  need  to  obtain  additional  financing,  uncertainty  related  to  COVID-19  and  its  impact  on  us  and  the
aerospace  industry,  as  well  as  continued  uncertainty  with  respect  to  our  credit  rating  could  limit  our  access  to  credit  markets  and  we  may  have
difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, certain of our customers may also be unable to make timely payments to
us. Factors that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further disruptions in the global capital markets and/or additional declines in our
financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations
and/or meet outstanding debt obligations and contractual commitments. In addition, further downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect
our  cost  of  funds  and  related  margins,  liquidity,  competitive  position  and  access  to  capital  markets,  and  a  significant  downgrade  could  have  an
adverse impact on our businesses.

Customer-related risks: Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend has impacted passenger traffic
most severely. Near-term cargo traffic has also fallen, but to a lesser extent as global trade has begun to recover. Most airlines have significantly
reduced their capacity, and many could implement further reductions in the near future. Many airlines are also implementing significant reductions in
staffing. These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our customers’ revenue, earnings, and
cash flow, and in some cases may threaten the future viability of some of our customers, potentially causing defaults within our customer financing
portfolio,  which  was  $2.0  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and/or  requiring  us  to  remarket  aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are
currently in backlog. If we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and/or the narrow-body and wide-body markets do not recover as soon
as  we  are  currently  assuming,  or  if  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  production  rates  and/or  contract  the  accounting  quantity  on  any  of  our
commercial programs, we could experience material reductions in earnings and/or be required to recognize a reach-forward loss on one or more of
our programs. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized a reach-forward loss on the 777X program in part due to impacts related to
the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  addition,  if  737  MAX  aircraft  in  one  or  more  jurisdictions  remain  grounded  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  we  may
experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may experience fewer new orders and increased
cancellations  across  all  of  our  commercial  airplane  programs  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated  impacts  on  demand.  Our
customers may also lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impacts from the pandemic. We are also observing a significant increase
in  the  number  of  requests  for  payment  deferrals,  contract  modifications,  lease  restructurings  and  similar  actions,  and  these  trends  may  lead  to
additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts in our business over time. In addition, to the extent that customers have valid
rights to cancel undelivered aircraft, we may be required to refund pre-delivery payments, putting additional constraints on our liquidity.

In  addition  to  the  near-term  impact,  there  is  risk  that  the  industry  implements  longer-term  strategies  involving  reduced  capacity,  shifting  route
patterns, and mitigation strategies related to impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience
reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel due to travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements.

As a result,  there  is significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  when commercial  air traffic  levels will begin to recover,  and whether  and at what point
capacity  will  return  to  and/or  exceed  pre-COVID-19  levels.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  also  has  increased,  and  its  aftermath  is  also  expected  to
continue to increase, uncertainty with respect to global trade volumes, which could put negative pressure on cargo traffic levels. Any of these factors
would have a significant  impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial  aircraft,  as well as for the services  we provide to
commercial  airlines.  In  addition,  a  lengthy  period  of  reduced  industry-wide  demand  for  commercial  aircraft  would  put  additional  pressure  on  our
suppliers, resulting in increased procurement costs and/or additional supply chain disruption. To

the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic or its aftermath further impacts demand for our products and services or impairs the viability of some of our
customers and/or suppliers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected, and those impacts could be
material.

Other  risks: The  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  global  COVID-19  pandemic  is  uncertain  and  continues  to  adversely  affect  our  business  and
operating and financial results. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2020, due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on our
earnings,  we  recorded  an  increase  of  $2.5  billion  to  the  valuation  allowance  associated  with  deferred  income  tax  assets.  The  pandemic  also  is
expected to heighten many of the other risks described below. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results
in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations

We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX. These risks include uncertainties regarding the timing and
conditions of 737 MAX regulatory approvals, in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, lower than planned production rates and/or delivery rates,
increased  considerations  to  customers,  increased  supplier  costs  and  supply  chain  health,  changes  to  the  assumptions  and  estimates
made in our financial statements regarding the 737 program, and potential outcomes of various 737 MAX-related legal proceedings and
government investigations.

On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S.
aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737
MAX were suspended until December 2020. The grounding has reduced revenues, operating margins, and cash flows, and will continue to do so
until production rates return to pre-grounding levels. In connection with the effort to return the 737 MAX to service, we developed software updates
for the 737 MAX, together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program. We continue to work with certain non-U.S. civil
aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide. Any delays in certification in one
or more jurisdictions and/or the ramp-up of deliveries or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to the
737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In January 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice
that resolves the Department of Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA.
We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. Any further adverse impacts related to any such litigation or investigation
could have a further material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

During  2019,  we  announced  plans  to  reduce,  and  ultimately  to  suspend  737  production.  Impacts  related  to  these  actions  significantly  increased
costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and have resulted in reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operating
margins. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2021 that should be included in program
inventory  and  those  estimated  costs  that  will  be  expensed  when  incurred  as  abnormal  production  costs.  If  we  are  unable  to  return  the  737  MAX
aircraft to service in one or more jurisdictions or deliver 737 aircraft to customers on the schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our expectations,
we will incur significant additional costs and/or delay the planned ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significant additional
disruption to the 737 production system and further delay efforts to restore and/or implement previously planned increases in the 737

Table of Contents

production  rate.  Cash  flows  continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  delayed  payments  from  customers,  higher  costs  and  inventory  levels,  and
payments  made  to  customers  in  connection  with  disruption  to  their  operations.  In  addition,  we  have  experienced  claims  and  assertions  from
customers in connection with the grounding, and we recorded an earnings charge of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries of $500 million, in
2019, in connection  with an estimate  of potential  concessions  and other  considerations  to customers  for  disruptions  related  to the grounding and
associated delivery delays.

Any further delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX in one or more jurisdictions, further disruptions to suppliers and/or the long-term health of
the  production  system,  supplier  claims  or  assertions,  or  changes  to  estimated  concessions  or  other  considerations  we  expect  to  provide  to
customers  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  and/or  cash  flows.  In  the  event  of  unanticipated
additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval, and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries to one or
more  customers,  we  may  be  required  to  take  actions  with  longer-term  impact,  such  as  further  changes  to  our  production  plans,  employment
reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers.

We have made significant estimates with respect to the 737 program regarding the number of units to be produced, the period during which those
units are likely to be produced, and the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine
warranty  costs.  In  addition  to  the  estimated  timing  of  the  resumption  of  deliveries,  we  have  made  assumptions  regarding  outcomes  of  accident
investigations and other government inquiries, timing of future 737 production rate increases, timing and sequence of future deliveries, supply chain
health  as  we  implement  our  production  plans,  as  well  as  outcomes  of  negotiations  with  customers.  Any  changes  in  these  estimates  and/or
assumptions with respect to the 737 program could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For
additional  information,  see  our  discussion  under  “Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis-Critical  Accounting  Policies  and  Estimates-737  MAX
Grounding” on pages 55 - 56.

In  addition  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19  described  above,  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Global  Services  businesses  depend  heavily  on
commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.

Market  conditions  have  a  significant  impact  on  demand  for  our  commercial  aircraft  and  related  services. The  commercial  aircraft  market  is
predominantly  driven  by  long-term  trends  in  airline  passenger  and  cargo  traffic.  The  principal  factors  underlying  long-term  traffic  growth  are
sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced
by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and
other  competitive  factors,  fuel  prices,  terrorism,  epidemics  and  environmental  regulations.  Traditionally,  the  airline  industry  has  been  cyclical  and
very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the
global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new
orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result
in  lower  revenues,  profitability  and  cash  flows  and  a  reduction  in  our  contractual  backlog.  In  addition,  because  our  commercial  aircraft  backlog
consists  of  aircraft  scheduled  for  delivery  over  a  period  of  several  years,  any  of  these  macroeconomic,  industry  or  customer  impacts  could
unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.

We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns
or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft
are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a
fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas

10

Table of Contents

derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation
formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in
escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from  a limited number of commercial  airlines. We can make no assurance  that any customer  will
exercise  purchase  options,  fulfill  existing  purchase  commitments  or  purchase  additional  products  or  services  from  us.  In  addition,  fleet  decisions,
airline  consolidations  or  financial  challenges  involving  any  of  our  major  commercial  airline  customers  could significantly  reduce  our  revenues  and
limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.

Our  Commercial  Airplanes  business  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  a  healthy  production  system,  achieve  planned  production  rate
targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.

The  commercial  aircraft  business  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with  U.S  and  non-U.S.  suppliers,  highly-
skilled  labor  from  thousands  of  employees  and  other  partners,  and  stringent  regulatory  requirements,  including  the  risk  of  evolving  standards  for
commercial aircraft certification, and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives,
such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. The 737 program
has also experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of 737 MAX production for part of 2020.
As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  regulatory  and  customer  requirements,  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program
profitability  is  subject  to  significant  risks.  For  example,  a  number  of  our  customers  may  have  contractual  remedies,  including  rights  to  reject
individual  airplane  deliveries  if  the  actual  delivery  date  is  significantly  later  than  the  contractual  delivery  date.  Delays  on  the  737  MAX  and  777X
programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and or substitute orders for other Boeing
aircraft.

We  must  minimize  disruption  caused  by  production  changes  and  achieve  productivity  improvements  in  order  to  meet  customer  demand  and
maintain  our  profitability.  We  have  previously  announced  plans  to  adjust  production  rates  on  several  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs.  We
continue to engage in significant ongoing development, testing and production of the 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to
reduce  the  costs  of  building  our  aircraft,  including  working  with  our  suppliers  to  reduce  supplier  costs,  identifying  and  implementing  productivity
improvements,  and  optimizing  how  we  manage  inventory.  If  production  rate  changes  at  any  of  our  commercial  aircraft  assembly  facilities  are
delayed or create significant  disruption  to our production  system,  or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components  to us at the cost and rates
necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs
may suffer.

Operational  challenges  impacting  the  production  system  for  one  or  more  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs  could  result  in  production  delays
and/or  failure  to  meet  customer  demand  for  new  aircraft,  either  of  which  would  negatively  impact  our  revenues  and  operating  margins.  Our
commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet
internal  performance  plans,  or  delays  or  failures  to  achieve  required  regulatory  approval,  could  result  in  significant  out-of-sequence  work  and
increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support
costs. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we expanded the scope of production inspections on the 787 program, and those inspections and
associated rework are delaying scheduled deliveries and resulting in additional 787 aircraft in inventory.

11

If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing
and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory
agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any
Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.

Changes  in  levels  of  U.S.  government  defense  spending  or  overall  acquisition  priorities  could  negatively  impact  our  financial  position
and results of operations.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the U.S. DoD. Levels of U.S.
defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the evolving nature of the national security threat
environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the
U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills.

Although FY21 appropriations have been enacted, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending beyond FY21,
and  it  is  likely  that  U.S.  government  discretionary  spending,  including  defense  spending,  will  continue  to  be  subject  to  pressure.  In  addition,  the
timeliness  of  future  appropriations  for  government  departments  and  agencies  remains  a  recurrent  risk.  A  lapse  in  appropriations  for  government
department or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Company’s operations. Alternatively, Congress
may  fund  government  departments  and  agencies  with  one  or  more  Continuing  Resolutions;  however,  this  could  restrict  the  execution  of  certain
program activities and delay new programs or competitions.

There  continues  to  be  uncertainty  with  respect  to  future  acquisition  priorities  and  program-level  appropriations  for  the  U.S.  DoD  and  other
government  agencies  (including  NASA),  including  tension  between  modernization  investments,  sustainment  investments,  and investments  in new
technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or budget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and
appropriations  process  could  result  in  reductions,  cancellations,  and/or  delays  of  existing  contracts  or  programs,  or  future  program  opportunities.
Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  significant  ongoing  uncertainty  with  respect  to  both  U.S.  defense  spending  and  the  evolving  nature  of  the  national
security threat environment, we also expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize affordability, innovation, cybersecurity, and delivery of technical
data  and  software  in  its  procurement  processes.  If  we  can  no  longer  adjust  successfully  to  these  changing  acquisition  policies  our  revenues  and
market share could be impacted.

12

Table of Contents

Our  ability  to  deliver  products  and  services  that  satisfy  customer  requirements  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  performance  and  financial
stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.

We rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components
and  sub-assemblies,  and  production  commodities  and  to  perform  some  of  the  services  that  we  provide  to  our  customers.  If  one  or  more  of  our
suppliers  or  subcontractors  experiences  financial  difficulties,  delivery  delays  or  other  performance  problems,  we  may  be  unable  to  meet
commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum,
titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a
timely  fashion  or  at  budgeted  costs.  In  some  instances,  we  depend  upon  a  single  source  of  supply.  Any  service  disruption  from  one  of  these
suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geopolitical developments, or as a result of performance problems or
financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.

Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.

The  markets  in  which  we  operate  are  highly  competitive  and  one  or  more  of  our  competitors  may  have  more  extensive  or  more  specialized
engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing
competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry
consolidation,  shifting  acquisition  and  budget  priorities,  and  continued  cost  pressure  at  our  U.S.  DoD  and  non-U.S.  customers  will  intensify
competition  for  many  of  our  BDS  products.  Our  BGS  segment  faces  competition  from  many  of  the  same  strong  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  competitors
facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not
result in reduced revenues and market share.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.

In 2020, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 37% of our revenues. We expect that non-
U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing
business internationally, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

changes in regulatory requirements;

changes in the global trade environment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international trade authorities,
that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outside the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers in the form of tariffs,
duties, or penalties attributable to the importation of Boeing products and services;

U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  policies,  including  requirements  to  expend  a  portion  of  program  funds  locally  and  governmental  industrial
cooperation or participation requirements;

fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;

volatility  in  international  political  and  economic  environments  and  changes  in  non-U.S.  national  priorities  and  budgets,  which  can  lead  to
delays or fluctuations in orders;

the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;

13

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank
of the United States;

uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;

imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;

the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;

compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and

unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.

While  the  impact  of  these  factors  is  difficult  to  predict,  any  one  or  more  of  these  factors  could  adversely  affect  our  operations  in  the  future.  For
example, since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanes
and represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. In addition, the U.S. and European Union (EU) have been engaged in
two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft, including one that has resulted in the imposition of
tariffs on certain of our products. Impacts from these or future potential tariffs, or deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and one or more
other countries, could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, operating earnings, and/or cash flows.

We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial
results.

Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule
and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is
complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because
costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to
performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess
anticipated performance. Supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of future
award fees are also included in sales and profit rates.

With  respect  to  each  of  our  commercial  aircraft  programs,  inventoriable  production  costs  (including  overhead),  program  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A
program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for
delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated  contracts  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable  estimates.  To  establish  the  relationship  of
sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over
which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other
non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of
intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to
price  escalation  indices,  costs  of  derivative  aircraft,  supplier  performance,  customer  and  supplier  negotiations/settlements,  supplier  claims  and/or
certification issues can impact these estimates. In addition, on development programs such as the 777X, we are subject to risks with respect to the
timing and conditions of aircraft certification, including potential gaps between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdictions, and our estimates
with

14

Table of Contents

respect  to  timing  of  future  certifications  could  have  an  impact  on  overall  program  status.  Any  such  change  in  estimates  relating  to  program
accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.

Because  of  the  significance  of  the  judgments  and  estimation  processes  described  above,  materially  different  sales  and  profit  amounts  could  be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or
estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and
profits, see our discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting”
on pages 53 – 55 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 68 – 81 of this Form 10-K.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.

As part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize
the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired
business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the
acquired  operations.  Accordingly,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely  affected  by  unanticipated  performance  issues,  legacy  liabilities,
transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner
performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While
we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these
transactions  will  be  successful.  We  also  may  make  strategic  divestitures  from  time  to  time.  These  transactions  may  result  in  continued  financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by
those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.

Risks Related to Our Contracts

We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.

In  2020,  51%  of  our  revenues  were  earned  pursuant  to  U.S.  government  contracts,  which  include  FMS  through  the  U.S.  government.  Business
conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.

Our sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. New
procurement  regulations,  or  changes  to  existing  requirements,  could  increase  our  compliance  costs  or  otherwise  have  a  material  impact  on  the
operating  margins  of  our  BDS  and  BGS  businesses.  These  requirements  may  result  in  increased  compliance  costs,  and  we  could  be  subject  to
additional  costs  in  the  form  of  withheld  payments  and/or  reduced  future  business  if  we  fail  to  comply  with  these  requirements  in  the  future.
Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition
and operating results.

The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or
terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition,
funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S.

Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further
uncertainty  with  respect  to  ongoing  programs  could  also  result  in  the  event  that  the  U.S.  government  finances  its  operations  through  temporary
funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding
and/or  modification,  curtailment,  or  termination  of  one  or  more  large  programs  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  earnings,  cash  flow
and/or financial position.

We are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.
government contracts. U.S.  government  agencies,  including  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  and  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency,
routinely  audit  government  contractors.  These  agencies  review  our  performance  under  contracts,  cost  structure  and  compliance  with  applicable
laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to
be  misclassified  or  inaccurately  allocated  to  a  specific  contract  will  be  deemed  non-reimbursable,  and  to  the  extent  already  reimbursed,  must  be
refunded.  Any  inadequacies  in  our  systems  and  policies  could  result  in  withholds  on  billed  receivables,  penalties  and  reduced  future  business.
Furthermore,  if  any  audit,  inquiry  or  investigation  uncovers  improper  or  illegal  activities,  we  could  be  subject  to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  and
administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from
doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such
allegations are later determined to be false.

We enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 69% and 72% of their 2020 revenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price
contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins
or  incurring  losses  if  we  are  unable  to  achieve  estimated  costs  and  revenues.  If  our  estimated  costs  exceed  our  estimated  price,  we  recognize
reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example in 2020, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $1,320
million on the KC-46A Tanker contract reflecting $551 million of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air Force to
develop  and  integrate  a  new  Remote  Vision  System,  and  the  remaining  costs  reflect  production  inefficiencies  including  impacts  of  COVID-19
disruption.  New  programs  could  also  have  risk  for  reach-forward  loss  upon  contract  award  and  during  the  period  of  contract  performance.  For
example,  in  2018,  in  connection  with  winning  the  T-7A  Red  Hawk  and  MQ-25  competitions,  we  recorded  a  loss  of  $400  million  associated  with
options  for  346  T-7A  Red  Hawk  aircraft  and  a  loss  of  $291  million  related  to  the  MQ-25  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)
contract.  The  long  term  nature  of  many  of  our  contracts  makes  the  process  of  estimating  costs  and  revenues  on  fixed-price  contracts  inherently
risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant
impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.

Fixed-price  development  contracts  are  generally  subject  to  more  uncertainty  than  fixed-price  production  contracts.  Many  of  these  development
programs  have  highly  complex  designs.  In  addition,  technical  or  quality  issues  that  arise  during  development  could  lead  to  schedule  delays  and
higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS
fixed-price  development  contracts  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B  Presidential  Aircraft,  MQ-25,  and
commercial and military satellites.

16

Table of Contents

We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.

Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately  31% and 28% of their 2020 revenues from cost-type  contracting arrangements.
Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or
incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in
reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program  cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Programs  whose  contracts  are
primarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and SLS programs.

We enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.

Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments
may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is
at  risk  if  the  satellite  does  not  perform  to  specifications  for  up  to  15  years  after  acceptance.  The  net  present  value  of  in-orbit  incentive  fees  we
ultimately  expect  to  realize  is  recognized  as  revenue  in  the  construction  period.  If  the  satellite  fails  to  meet  contractual  performance  criteria,
customers  will  not  be  obligated  to  continue  making  in-orbit  payments  and/or  we  may  be  required  to  provide  refunds  to  the  customer  and  incur
significant charges.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Business Disruptions

Unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.

We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive
network of technical security controls, policy enforcement  mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these
threats.  While  these  measures  are  designed  to  prevent,  detect  and  respond  to  unauthorized  activity  in  our  systems,  certain  types  of  attacks,
including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and
information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized
access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged,
and/or we could face financial losses.

Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.

Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging
weather  or  other  acts  of  nature  and  pandemics  or  other  public  health  crises.  Any  of  these  disruptions  could  affect  our  internal  operations  or  our
ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our
data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and
of our products and services.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters

The  outcome  of  litigation  and  of  government  inquiries  and  investigations  involving  our  business  is  unpredictable  and  an  adverse
decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to
benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these
lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to extensive
regulation  under  the  laws  of  the  United  States  and  its  various  states,  as  well  as  other  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  As  a  result,  we  are
sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S.
government,  the  heavily  regulated  nature  of  our  industry,  and in  the  case  of  environmental  proceedings,  our  current  or  past  ownership  of  certain
property.  Any  such  inquiry  or  investigation  could  potentially  result  in  an  adverse  ruling  against  us,  which  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our
financial position and results of operations.

Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge,
treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines
and  civil  or  criminal  sanctions,  as  well  as  third-party  claims  for  property  damage  or  personal  injury,  if  we  were  to  violate  or  become  liable  under
environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past
manufacturing  operations  or  the  operations  of  companies  we  have  acquired.  In  other  cases,  we  may  become  subject  to  such  costs  due  to  an
indemnification  agreement  between  us  and  a  third  party  relating  to  such  environmental  liabilities.  In  addition,  new  laws  and  regulations,  more
stringent  enforcement  of  existing  laws  and  regulations,  the  discovery  of  previously  unknown  contamination  or  the  imposition  of  new  remediation
requirements  could  result  in  additional costs.  For  additional  information  relating  to  environmental  contingencies,  see Note  13 to  our  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity

We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable
terms or in sufficient amounts.

We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. In addition, our debt balances have increased
significantly since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to
actively manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, our debt
totaled  $63.6  billion  of  which  approximately  $20.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  In
addition, as of December 31, 2020, our airplane financing commitments totaled $11,512 million. If we require additional funding in order to pay off
existing  debt,  address  further  impacts  to  our  business  related  to  the  737  MAX,  COVID-19,  or  broader  market  developments,  fund  outstanding
financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. These risks will be particularly acute if we
are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty
accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the  global  capital  markets  and/or  a  decline  in  our
financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the

18

Table of Contents

COVID-19  pandemic  and/or  associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may
adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.

Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash
flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.

Many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts
required  under  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary  contributions  to  improve  the  plans'  funded  status.  The  extent  of
future  contributions  depends  heavily  on  market  factors  such  as  the  discount  rate  and  the  actual  return  on  plan  assets.  We  estimate  future
contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect
on future  contributions  as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result  in a significant  change to shareholders'  equity. For  U.S. government
contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We
also  provide  other  postretirement  benefits  to  certain  of  our  employees,  consisting  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level
of  medical  cost  increases.  For  a  discussion  regarding  how  our  financial  statements  can  be  affected  by  pension  and  other  postretirement  plan
accounting policies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-Pension Plans” on pages 57 - 58 of this Form 10-K.
Although  under  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  the  timing  of  periodic  pension  and  other
postretirement benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely
affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.

We  are  exposed  to  liabilities  that  are  unique  to  the  products  and  services  we  provide.  We  maintain  insurance  for  certain  risks  and,  in  some
circumstances,  we  may  receive  indemnification  from  the  U.S.  government.  The  amount  of  our  insurance  coverage  may  not  cover  all  claims  or
liabilities  and  we  may  be  forced  to  bear  substantial  costs.  For  example,  liabilities  arising  from  the  use  of  certain  of  our  products,  such  as  aircraft
technologies, space systems, spacecraft, satellites, missile systems, weapons, cyber security, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies,
and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from
liability  within  the  U.S.  under  the  SAFETY  Act  provisions  of  the  2002  Homeland  Security  Act,  no  such  protection  is  available  outside  the  U.S.,
potentially  resulting  in  significant  liabilities.  The  amount  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  these  or  other  claims  or
liabilities.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft,
which exposes us to concentration risks.

A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is
also  concentrated  by  varying  degrees  across  Boeing  aircraft  product  types,  most  notably  717  and  747-8  aircraft,  and  among  customers  that  we
believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial
difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable
terms, or if the types of

19

Table of Contents

aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could
be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to Labor

Some of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.

Approximately 47,000 employees, which constitute 33% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2020. We experienced a
work  stoppage  in  2008  when  a  labor  strike  halted  commercial  aircraft  and  certain  BDS  program  production.  We  may  experience  additional  work
stoppages  in  the  future,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business.  We  cannot  predict  how  stable  our  relationships,  currently  with  10  U.S.  labor
organizations  and  12  non-U.S.  labor  organizations,  will  be  or  whether  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the  unions’  requirements  without  impacting  our
financial  condition.  The  unions  may  also  limit  our  flexibility  in  dealing  with  our  workforce.  Union  actions  at  suppliers  can  also  affect  us.  Work
stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships
with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Overview

We are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites,
missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the
worldwide  commercial  airline  industry  and  one  of  the  largest  defense  contractors  in  the  U.S.  While  our  principal  operations  are  in  the  U.S.,  we
conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.

Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and
Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated
substantial  earnings  and  cash  flow  that  permit  us  to  invest  in  new  products  and services.  We  focus  on producing  the  products  and providing  the
services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA
is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to
customers  around  the  world.  BDS  integrates  its  resources  in  defense,  intelligence,  communications,  security,  space  and  services  to  deliver
capability-driven  solutions  to  customers  at  reduced  costs.  Our  BDS  strategy  is  to  leverage  our  core  businesses  to  capture  key  next-generation
programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS
provides  support  for  commercial  and  defense  through  innovative,  comprehensive,  and  cost-competitive  product  and  service  solutions.  BCC
facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.

Business Environment and Trends

The global outbreak of COVID-19 and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continue to have significant adverse impacts on our business
and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. They are also having a significant
impact on our liquidity - see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of liquidity and additional
actions we are taking in response to these challenges.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  caused  an  unprecedented  shock  to  demand  for  air  travel,  creating  a  tremendous  challenge  for  our  customers,  our
business  and  the  entire  commercial  aerospace  manufacturing  and  services  sector.  Global  economic  growth,  a  primary  driver  for  air  travel,  is
expected to have declined to between -4% and -5% in 2020. The latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast projected full-year
2020  passenger  traffic  to  be  down  more  than  60%  compared  to  2019  as  global  economic  activity  slows  due  to  COVID-19,  and  governments
severely restricted travel to contain the spread of the virus. The recovery remains slow and uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travel
protocols continue to impact air travel. Generally, we expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we expect the
narrow-body market to recover faster than the wide-body market. Also, the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent on
COVID-19  infection  rates,  progress  on  testing,  government  travel  restrictions,  and  timing  and  availability  of  a  vaccine.  Air  cargo  traffic  levels
contracted  this  year  due  to  weak  global  trade  growth  and  capacity  limitations  given  the  large  impact  that  COVID-19  has  had  on  international
passenger operations, which also carry cargo. Demand for dedicated freighters is developing better relative to cargo traffic trends.

24

Table of Contents

Airline financial performance,  which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to IATA, net losses in 2020 for the airline industry are expected to be approximately $118 billion, compared to net profits of $26 billion in
2019. Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many
forms such as deferrals of advances and other payments to suppliers, deferrals of deliveries, reduced spending on services, and, in some cases,
cancellation of orders. We face a challenging environment in the near to medium term as airlines adjust to reduced traffic which in turn will lower
demand for commercial aerospace products and services. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.

We currently expect it will take approximately three years for world-wide travel to return to 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industry
to return to long-term trend growth of approximately 5%. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-
term potential and competitiveness, we have reduced the production rates of several of our BCA programs. These rate decisions are based on our
ongoing  assessments  of  the  demand  environment  and  availability  of  aircraft  financing.  There  is  significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  when
commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourth
quarter of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We now anticipate that the
first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We will closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers’ evolving
fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined rate management process, and make adjustments
as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk remains that further reductions will be required.
Additionally,  if  we  are  unable  to  make  timely  deliveries  of  the  large  number  of  aircraft  in  inventory  as  of  December  31,  2020,  future  revenues,
earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted.

The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity
to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shock
from  COVID-19  has  reduced  the  near  to  medium  term  demand,  but  our  Commercial  Market  Outlook  forecast  projects  a  4%  growth  rate  for
passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.5% average annual GDP growth, we
project  demand  for  approximately  43,000  new  airplanes  over  the  next  20  years.  The  industry  remains  vulnerable  to  exogenous  developments
including  fuel  price  spikes,  credit  market  shocks,  acts  of  terrorism,  natural  disasters,  conflicts,  epidemics,  pandemics  and  increased  global
environmental regulations.

Deliveries  of the 737 MAX resumed  in the fourth  quarter  of 2020, when the FAA rescinded  the order that  grounded 737 MAX aircraft  in the U.S.
Orders to suspend operations of 737 MAX aircraft from certain non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the Civil Aviation Administration of China,
are  still  in  effect.  The  grounding  has  had  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  our  operations  and  creates  significant  uncertainty.  We  are  focused  on
safely returning the 737 MAX to service for all of our customers.

At BGS, we are seeing a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and more aircraft retirements result in a decreased
demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spending, such as modifications and
upgrades and focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the commercial services business. The
demand outlook for our government services business, which in 2019 accounted for just under half of BGS revenue, remains stable.

At  BDS,  we  continue  to  see  a  healthy  market  with  solid  demand  for  our  major  platforms  and  programs  both  domestically  and  internationally.
However, we experienced near-term production impacts associated with our temporary suspension of operations at various locations in 2020 .

25

Table of Contents

In March and April of 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended operations at multiple locations including the Puget Sound area,
South  Carolina  and  Philadelphia.  Operations  in  Puget  Sound  and  Philadelphia  resumed  during  the  week  of  April  20,  while  operations  in  South
Carolina resumed beginning on May 3. We have implemented procedures to promote employee safety in our facilities, including more frequent and
enhanced cleaning and adjusted schedules and work flows to support physical distancing. These actions have resulted, and will continue to result, in
increased operating costs. In addition, a number of our suppliers have suspended or otherwise reduced their operations, and we are experiencing
some supply chain shortages. Our suppliers are also experiencing liquidity pressures and disruptions to their operations as a result of COVID-19.
We also continue to have large numbers of employees working from home. These measures and disruptions have reduced overall productivity and
adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in 2020. We expect further adverse impacts in future quarters.

In  July  2020,  we  announced  our  business  transformation  efforts  to  assess  our  business  across  five  key  pillars  –  infrastructure,  overhead  and
organization, portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. We continue to make progress across all five key pillars as
we utilize a lower production rate environment to transform and improve our business processes. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing
our  overall  facility  requirements  in  light  of  reduced  demand  in  our  commercial  businesses  and  remote  and  virtual  work  opportunities  for  large
numbers  of  our  workforce.  The  consolidation  of  the  787  production  in  South  Carolina  is  an  example  of  this.  We  also  anticipate  a  reduction  of
approximately  30%  in  office  space  needs  compared  to  our  current  capacity.  During  2020,  we  made  certain  reductions  to  our  footprint  and  are
planning  to  implement  further  reductions  over  the  next  few  years.  However,  as  we  consolidate  our  footprint,  we  may  incur  near  term  adverse
impacts  to  earnings.  The  overhead  and  organization  pillar  is  focused  on  our  cost  structure  and  how  we  are  organized  so  we  can  right  size  our
workforce  and  simplify  and  reduce  management  layers  and  bureaucracy.  During  2020,  we  recorded  severance  costs  for  approximately  26,000
employees, of which approximately 18,000 have left the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021. The
portfolio and investments pillar includes aligning our portfolio and investments to focus on our core business and the changes in market conditions.
Through our portfolio and investment prioritization, we reduced research and development and capital expenditures during 2020 by $1.3 billion from
the  prior  year. The  supply  chain  pillar  is  focused  on  supply  chain  health  and  stability,  reducing  indirect  procurement  spend  and  streamlining  our
transportation,  logistics  and  warehousing  approach.  We  reduced  indirect  spend  in  2020,  by  reducing  expenditures  in  areas  such  as  freight  and
logistics,  purchased  services  and  others.  The  operational  excellence  pillar  is  focused  on  improving  performance,  enhancing  quality  and  reducing
rework. For example, our information technology teams are evaluating opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow
us to simplify and optimize our operations, and reduce overall costs. These activities are not intended to constrain our capacity, but to enable the
Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improve
near term liquidity and long term cost competitiveness.

Revenues decreased by $18,401 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower revenues in our commercial airplanes and commercial
services  businesses.  Revenues  for  each  of  our  segments  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  COVID-19.  BCA  revenues  decreased  by  $16,093
million due to lower deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues, and the 737 MAX grounding, offset by lower
charges  related  to  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  737  MAX  customers.  BDS  revenues  increased  by  $162  million
primarily  due  to  higher  fighter  aircraft  and  other  volume,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  higher  unfavorable  cumulative  contract  catch-up
adjustments,  largely  due  to  the  KC-46A  Tanker  charges  in  2020.  BGS  revenues  decreased  by  $2,925  million  primarily  due  to  lower  commercial
services revenue driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily reflect the timing
of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries, as well as reserves related to cost accounting litigation recorded in 2019. We expect the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to significantly impact revenues in future quarters until the commercial airline industry recovers.

27

Table of Contents

Revenues decreased by $24,568 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower revenues at BCA, partially offset by higher revenues at
BGS.  Lower  BCA  revenues  are  primarily  driven  by  lower  737  MAX  deliveries  and  a  revenue  reduction  of  $8,259  million  recorded  in  2019  for
estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  for  disruptions  and  associated  delivery  delays  related  to  the  737  MAX
grounding,  net  of  insurance  recoveries.  The  changes  in  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  primarily  reflect  the  timing  of  eliminations  for
intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

Loss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at
BGS and BDS. BCA loss from operations increased by $7,190 million. The loss in 2020 primarily reflects a reach-forward loss recorded in the fourth
quarter  of  $6,493  million  on  the  777X  program.  The  reach-forward  loss  reflects  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global
certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the
aircraft’s  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraft
delivery  timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation
costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain  impacts.  The  loss  in  2020  also  reflects  the  absence  of  MAX  deliveries  during  the  first  three
quarters  of  the  year,  lower  wide-body  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues,
abnormal production costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 737 MAX customer considerations.

The  loss  in  2019  primarily  reflects  the  absence  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  the  second,  third  and  fourth  quarters,  and  charges  of  $8,259  million  for
estimated  737  MAX  customer  considerations.  BDS  earnings  decreased  by  $1,076  million  in  2020  compared  with  2019,  primarily  due  to  higher
unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, including charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B in 2020,
offset by $489 million of charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The

28

Table of Contents

lower earnings were also driven by lower gains on property sales compared to 2019. BGS earnings from operations decreased by $2,247 million in
2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower commercial services revenue, as well as asset impairments and severance costs resulting from the
COVID-19  market  environment.  We  expect  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to  continue  to  reduce  earnings  in  future  quarters  until  the
commercial airline industry recovers.

Loss  from  operations  was  $1,975  million  in  2019  compared  with  earnings  from  operations  of  $11,987  million  in  2018.  The  decrease  of  $13,962
million is primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million in 2019 compared to earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018,
partially  offset  by  higher  earnings  at  BDS  and  BGS  in  2019  compared  with  2018.  BCA  results  decreased  by  $14,487  million  due  to  lower  737
deliveries and the earnings charges for estimated 737 MAX grounding customer considerations of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries. BDS
earnings  from  operations  increased  by  $923  million  primarily  due  to  lower  charges  in  2019  for  development  programs.  BGS  earnings  from
operations increased by $161 million primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix.

During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $1,320 million, $148 million, and $736 million,
respectively.

Core operating loss increased by $10,760 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher losses at BCA and lower earnings at BGS and
BDS.

Core operating earnings decreased by $14,050 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA in 2019, partially
offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS.

Share-based plans expense increased by $55 million in 2020, and decreased by $11 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to increased
grants of RSUs and other share-based compensation. See Note 17.

Deferred compensation expense decreased by $81 million in 2020 and increased by $155 million in 2019, primarily driven by changes in broad stock
market conditions and our stock price.

29

Table of Contents

Research and development expense decreased by $161 million in 2020 and increased by $257 million in 2019 primarily due to spending by Boeing
NeXt on product development.

In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues, and a
$109  million  charge  related  to  ongoing  litigation  associated  with  recoverable  costs  on  U.S.  government  contracts.  In  2018,  we  recorded  a  $148
million charge related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation.

Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $822 million in 2020 primarily due to earnings charges of $744 million in the fourth quarter
of  2020  related  to  an  agreement  between  Boeing  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  in  January  2021.  See  Note  13.  Eliminations  and  other
unallocated expense decreased by $13 million in 2019 primarily due to timing of expense allocations.

The  pension  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment  recognized  in  (Loss)/earnings  from  operations  in  2020,  2019,  and  2018  was  largely  consistent
across  all  periods.  The  decrease  in  net  periodic  benefit  cost  included  in  (Loss)/earnings  from  operations  in  2020  was  primarily  due  to  prior  year
service cost that was included in earnings in 2019. The net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations in 2019 was consistent
with 2018, as reductions in current year service cost were offset by higher amortization of prior year service costs.

decreased income in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and lower asset returns, partially offset by lower
interest  cost.  The  increased  income  in  2019  compared  to  2018  was  due  to  lower  amortization  of  actuarial  losses,  partially  offset  by  lower  asset
returns and higher interest cost.

Non-operating postretirement expense included in Other income, net was $16 million in 2020, $107 million in 2019, and $101 million in 2018. The
decreased expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to lower interest cost. The expense in 2019 was largely consistent with 2018.

Interest and debt expense increased by $1,434 million in 2020 and increased by $247 million in 2019 as a result of higher debt balances.

For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)

Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs.
Our  BCA  segment  predominantly  uses  program  accounting  to  account  for  cost  of  sales.  Under  program  accounting,  cost  of  sales  for  each
commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales
percentage  applicable  to  the  total  remaining  program.  For  long-term  contracts,  the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales  is  recognized  as  incurred.
Substantially  all contracts  at  our  BDS segment  and  certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  are  long-term  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government  and
other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.

Contractual  backlog  of  unfilled  orders  excludes  purchase  options,  announced  orders  for  which  definitive  contracts  have  not  been  executed,  and
unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2020 was primarily due to a reduction for
orders that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog
primarily due to 737 MAX and 777X, deliveries in excess of new orders, aircraft order cancellations and changes in projected price escalation. We
are  experiencing  fewer  new  737  MAX  orders  than  we  were  receiving  prior  to  the  grounding.  If  737  MAX  aircraft  remain  grounded  in  certain
jurisdictions  for  an  extended  period  of  time  and/or  if  entry  into  service  of  the  777X,  737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may
experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and
increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.

Unobligated  backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been  authorized.  The  decrease  in
unobligated  backlog  in  2020  was  primarily  due  to  reclassifications  to  contractual  backlog  related  to  BGS  and  BDS  contracts,  partially  offset  by
contract awards.

Additional Considerations

Global Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs,
trade agreements, or sanctions that may impact the company.

The  global  economy  is  currently  experiencing  significant  adverse  impacts  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  including  a  decline  in  overall  trade  in
general and in aerospace in particular.  There is a great deal of uncertainty  regarding the duration,  scale, and localization of these impacts  to the
global economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoring
the  current  impact  and  potential  future  economic  consequences  of  COVID-19  to  the  global  economy,  the  aerospace  sector,  and  our  Company.
These adverse economic impacts have resulted in fewer orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.

China  is  a  very  significant  market  for  commercial  airplanes  and  represents  a  significant  component  of  our  commercial  airplanes  backlog. Since
2018,  the  U.S.  and  China  imposed  an  escalating  series  of  tariffs  on  each  other’s  imports.  Certain  aircraft  parts  and  components  that  Boeing
procures  are  subject  to  these  tariffs.  The  U.S.  and  China  entered  into  a  Phase  I  agreement  in  January  2020.  However,  implementation  of  this
agreement is incomplete and overall diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments for
potential adverse impacts to the Company.

Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.
trading  partners  have  imposed,  or  announced  their  intention  to  impose,  tariffs  on  U.S.  goods.  In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Government,  Mexico  and
Canada  reached  an  agreement  to  end  the  steel  and  aluminum  tariffs  between  these  countries.  Implementation  of  the  U.S./Mexico/Canada  Free
Trade  Agreement  (USMCA)  will  also  result  in  lower  tariffs.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  potential  for  any  extra  costs  that  may  result  from  the
remaining global tariffs.

The  U.S.  Government  continues  to  impose  and/or  consider  imposing  sanctions  on  certain  businesses  and  individuals  in  Russia.  Although  our
operations  or  sales  in  Russia  have  not  been  impacted  to  date,  we  continue  to  monitor  additional  sanctions  that  may  be  imposed  by  the  U.S.
Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers.

The U.S. and European Union (EU) have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil
aircraft.  As  part  of  those  disputes,  in  October  2019,  the  WTO  authorized  the  U.S.  to  impose  approximately  $7.50  billion  in  annual  tariffs  on  EU
products in connection with the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. The U.S. is currently imposing 15% tariffs on new
Airbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fuselages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, the WTO
authorized  the  EU  to  impose  approximately  $3.99  billion  in  annual  tariffs  on  U.S.  products  in  connection  with  a  tax  incentive  used  by  Boeing  in
Washington state that has since been repealed. The EU is currently imposing 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU. We will continue
to  assess  and  work  with  our  customers  on  the  possible  impact  of  these  tariffs,  as  deliveries  to  European  customers  are  expected  to  increase  in
2021.

Business Environment and Trends

Airline  Industry  Environment  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  for  a
discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, government
restrictions, and new regulations. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and
responses  have  varied  globally,  the  reduction  of  demand  and  disruption  in  production  has  adversely  impacted  most  manufacturers  in  the
commercial airplane industry.

Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately
80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on
increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the
737  MAX  and  the  associated  suspension  of  737  MAX  deliveries  significantly  reduced  our  market  share  with  respect  to  deliveries  of  single  aisle
aircraft  in  2019  and  2020  and  may  provide  competitors  with  an  opportunity  to  obtain  more  orders  and  increase  market  share.  With  government
support,  Airbus  has  historically  invested  heavily  to  create  a  family  of  products  to  compete  with  ours.  After  the  acquisition  of  a  majority  share  of
Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in
different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial
support,  including  “launch  aid,”  which  greatly  reduces  the  cost  and  commercial  risks  associated  with  airplane  development  activities.  This  has
enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and
many  offered  for  sale  below market-based  prices.  Competitors  continue  to make  improvements  in efficiency,  which may  result  in funding product
development,  gaining  market  share  and  improving  earnings.  This  market  environment  has  resulted  in  intense  pressures  on  pricing  and  other
competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.

We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to compete
and  positions  us  for  market  recovery.  We  are  also  focused  on  taking  actions  to  ensure  that  Boeing  is  not  harmed  by  unfair  subsidization  of
competitors.

BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower deliveries primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding. This was partially offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions
and other considerations to 737 MAX customers of $498 million in 2020 compared with $8,259 million in 2019.

BCA revenues decreased by $25,244 million in 2019 compared with 2018 driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259
million that was recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers related to the 737 MAX grounding, net
of $500 million of insurance recoveries.

While we resumed deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in December 2020, the 737 MAX grounding is still in effect in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The
737  MAX  grounding  will  continue  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  future  revenues  until  deliveries  ramp  up,  and COVID-19  will  continue  to  have  a
significant impact on future revenues until the commercial airline industry recovers.

Loss/Earnings From Operations

BCA  loss  from  operations  was  $13,847  million  in  2020  compared  with  loss  from  operations  of  $6,657  million  in  2019.  The  2020  loss  reflects  the
reach-forward  loss  on  777X  of  $6,493  million,  lower  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787
production issues and associated rework, $2,567 million of abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX, $623 million of

35

Table of Contents

severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer  considerations,  $336 million related  to 737NG frame  fitting  component  repair  costs  and $270
million of abnormal production costs in the first half of 2020 from the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19, partially offset
by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction in the accounting quantity in the first quarter of 2020 also
contributed to lower earnings. The 2019 loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019
and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.

BCA loss from operations was $6,657 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018. The decrease of $14,487
million is primarily due to lower 737 deliveries and earnings charges related to the 737 MAX.

The 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until 737
MAX deliveries ramp up and wide-body deliveries return to historical levels.

Backlog

Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where
we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to
perform.  Backlog  does  not  include  prospective  orders  where  customer  controlled  contingencies  remain,  such  as  the  customer  receiving  approval
from  its  board  of  directors,  shareholders  or  government  or  completing  financing  arrangements.  All  such  contingencies  must  be  satisfied  or  have
expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number
of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later
than  the  contractual  delivery  date.  We  address  customer  claims  and  requests  for  other  contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  The  value  of  orders  in
backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Topic
606.

BCA  total  backlog  of  $281,588  million  at  December  31,  2020  decreased  from  $376,593  million  at  December  31,  2019,  reflecting  a  reduction  for
orders that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, aircraft order cancellations, changes
in projected price escalation and deliveries in excess of new orders. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled
$34,618 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX aircraft. The ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $54,450 million
and  primarily  relate  to  737  MAX  aircraft  and  777X  aircraft.  The  ASC  606  adjustments  include  aircraft  orders  where  a  customer  controlled
contingency now exists, as well as orders where we can no longer assert that the customer is committed to perform or that it is probable that the
customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded in certain jurisdictions for an extended period
of  time  and/or  if  entry  into  service  of  the  777X,  737  MAX  7  and/or  737  MAX  10  is  further  delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to
backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all
of our commercial airplane programs as a result the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.

Accounting Quantity The  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  delivery  under  existing  and
anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue
and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a
program’s  life.  Estimation  of  each  program’s  accounting  quantity  takes  into  account  several  factors  that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  that
program, including firm orders,

36

Table of Contents

letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.

The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be
under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity
must be considered.

The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent
the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not
included  in  program  accounting  quantities.  All  revenues  and  costs  associated  with  military  derivative  aircraft  production  are  reported  in  the  BDS
segment.

Program Highlights

737 Program We reduced the program accounting quantity from 10,400 at December 31, 2019 to 10,000 at March 31, 2020. This reflects a slower
than  previously  planned  production  rate  ramp-up  caused  by  commercial  airline  industry  uncertainty  due  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19.  See  further
discussion of the 737 MAX Grounding and COVID-19 Impacts and Product Warranties in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We will complete production of the 747 in 2022. We believe that ending
production of the 747 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2020 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining
additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program.
We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.

37

Table of Contents

777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2020 due to the program’s normal progress of
obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The production rate expectation for the combined 777/777X program remains at 2 per month in
2021.

In 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777X
was completed during the first quarter of 2020.

During the first three quarters of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. As
previously  disclosed,  market  uncertainties  driven  primarily  by  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  resulted  in  lower  planned  production  rates  and  created
significant pressure on the 777X program’s revenue and cost estimates. While the 777X program did not have a reach-forward loss as of the third
quarter of 2020 based on our assessment of the probable range of initial accounting quantities and other factors at that time, we noted that future
levels  of  777X  profitability  would  be  subject  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  continued  market  uncertainty,  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our
production  system  as  well  as  on  our  supply  chain  and  customers,  subsequent  production  rate  reductions  for  both  777X  and  other  commercial
programs, and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of 777X certification.

We now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in the
fourth  quarter  of  2020.  The  revised  schedule  and  the  reach-forward  loss  reflect  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global
certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the
aircraft’s  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraft
delivery  timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation
costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts.

The  timing  of  the  certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated  certification
requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.

The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts
of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or
other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of
aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.

787  Program During  2020,  we  experienced  significant  reductions  in  deliveries  due  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our  customers  as  well  as
production issues  and associated rework.  The 787 program  delivered four  airplanes during the fourth  quarter  of 2020 and has a large number of
undelivered airplanes in inventory at December 31, 2020. We expanded the scope of production inspections during the fourth quarter of 2020, and
those  inspections  and  associated  rework  are  delaying  scheduled  deliveries  and  resulting  in  additional  787  aircraft  in  inventory.  At  December  31,
2020,  we  had  approximately  80  787  aircraft  in  inventory.  We  expect  deliveries  to  resume  at  a  slow  pace  in  early  2021,  with  the  majority  of  the
aircraft in inventory expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. We continue to work with customers to facilitate deliveries. We are implementing
changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections. Pre-
COVID-19, we were producing at a rate of 14 per month and had planned to adjust the 787 production rate to 12 per month in late 2020 and to 10
per month in early 2021. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on customer demand, we now plan to reduce to 5 per month in 2021. As a result of the
planned production rate changes, we reduced the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units during the first quarter of 2020. The 787
program has near breakeven gross margins due to the

38

Table of Contents

reductions in the production rates and the reduction in the program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity
and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, or experience other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could record
a  reach-forward  loss  in  future  periods.  We  made  the  decision  during  the  third  quarter  of  2020  to  consolidate  787  production  in  South  Carolina  in
2021, which did not have a significant financial impact on the program.

Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation.
Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life
of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance  training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and
technical  data  and  documents.  The  costs  for  fleet  support  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  have  historically  been  approximately  1%  of  total
consolidated costs of products and services.

Program  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial  delivery  for  major  Commercial
Airplanes derivatives and programs.

the first 737 MAX 10 and 777X delivery will occur in 2023. This schedule reflects a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global
certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the
aircraft’s design.

Additional Considerations

The  development  and  ongoing  production  of  commercial  aircraft  is  extremely  complex,  involving  extensive  coordination  and  integration  with
suppliers  and highly-skilled  labor  from  employees  and other  partners.  Meeting  or  exceeding our performance  and reliability  standards,  as  well as
those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such
as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These
challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to
deliver  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to
significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward
losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price
escalation  factors  due  to  changes  in  the  inflation  rate  or  other  economic  indicators,  performance  or  reliability  issues  involving  completed  aircraft,
capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation,
achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test
and  certification  schedules,  costs,  schedule  and  demand  for  new  airplanes  and  derivatives  and  status  of  customer  claims,  supplier  claims  or
assertions  and  other  contractual  negotiations.  While  we  believe  the  cost  and  revenue  estimates  incorporated  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become

39

Table of Contents

necessary  or  scheduled  delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  order  cancellations  or  other  financially
significant exposure.

Defense, Space & Security

Business Environment and Trends

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

The Omnibus appropriations acts for FY21, enacted in December 2020, provided FY21 appropriations for government departments and agencies,
including the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation
Administration.

The enacted FY21 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64
Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future
program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,
including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing
contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need
to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the
Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2020, 31.8% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.

Since  our  operating  cycle  is  long-term  and  involves  many  different  types  of  development  and  production  contracts  with  varying  delivery  and
milestone  schedules,  the  operating  results  of  a  particular  period,  may  not  be  indicative  of  future  operating  results.  In  addition,  depending  on  the
customer  and  their  funding  sources,  our  orders  might  be  structured  as  annual  follow-on  contracts,  or  as  one  large  multi-year  order  or  long-term
award.  As  a  result,  period-to-period  comparisons  of  backlog  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  future  workloads.  The  following  discussions  of
comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

BDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52
upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact
of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which was $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46A
Tanker charges during 2020.

BDS revenues in 2019 decreased by $205 million compared with 2018 primarily due to timing associated with non-U.S. contract awards for fighters
and the final C-17 sale occurring in 2018; in addition, the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was $163 million higher
than  the  prior  year,  reflecting  increased  unfavorable  adjustments  on  the  Commercial  Crew  contract  and  less  favorable  performance.  These  were
partially offset by increases from new programs, including E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25, as well as from satellites
and weapons.

Earnings From Operations

BDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the  unfavorable  impact  of  cumulative
contract catch-up adjustments, which was $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and
$168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in the prior period. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower
gains  on  property  sales  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019.  These  current  period  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  the  volume  increases
described above.

The KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss of $1,320 million reflects $551 million of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the
U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, and the remaining costs reflect production inefficiencies including impacts of
COVID-19 disruption. The $168 million reach-forward loss on VC-25B recorded in the first quarter was associated

41

Table of Contents

with  engineering  inefficiencies  from  the  COVID-19  environment.  We  believe  these  inefficiencies  will  result  in  staffing  challenges,  schedule
inefficiencies, and higher costs in the upcoming phases of the program.

BDS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $923 million compared with 2018 primarily due to the absence of $691 million related to losses
on the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $62 million lower
than  the  prior  year.  In  2019,  BDS  recorded  charges  of  $489  million  related  to  Commercial  Crew  and  $148  million  related  to  KC-46A  Tanker
compared with $736 million in 2018.

BDS  earnings  from  operations  include  equity  earnings  of  $141  million,  $128  million  and  $147  million  primarily  from  our  ULA  and  non-U.S.  joint
ventures in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Backlog

Total backlog of $60,847 million at December 31, 2020 was $2,844 million lower than December 31, 2019 due to the timing of awards and revenue
recognized.

Additional Considerations

Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have
cost-type  contracting  arrangements.  In  these  cases,  the  associated  financial  risks  are  primarily  in  reduced  fees,  lower  profit  rates  or  program
cancellation  if  cost,  schedule  or  technical  performance  issues  arise.  Examples  of  these  programs  include  Ground-based  Midcourse  Defense,
Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.

Some  of  our development  programs  are  contracted  on a  fixed-price  basis,  and BDS customers  are increasingly  seeking fixed-price  proposals  for
new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-
25B, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of
contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may
experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of
which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the
cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as
additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the
loss  of  satellite  in-orbit  incentive  payments,  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  These  programs  have  risk  for  reach-forward  losses  if  our
estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.

Global Services

Business Environment and Trends

The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training
and professional services; and information services. Prior to COVID-19, we had expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however the
pandemic  is  having  a  direct  impact  on  our  commercial  services  business.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

Over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to
increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of

42

Table of Contents

airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines
continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  reduce  the  size  and  cost  of  their  spare  parts  inventory,  frequently  outsourcing  spares  management  to  third
parties.

The  demand  outlook  for  our  government  services  business  has  remained  stable  in  2020.  Government  services  market  segments  are  growing  on
pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual
market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and
non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect
less  than  20  percent  of  the  worldwide  fleet  of  military  aircraft  to  be  retired  and  replaced  over  the  next  ten  years,  driving  increased  demand  for
services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.

BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 40, which could restrict the
execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.

Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment
has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global
markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.

BGS  revenues  in  2020  decreased  by  $2,925  million  compared  with  2019  due  to  lower  commercial  services  revenue  driven  by  impacts  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period
in the prior year. We  expect  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  to  continue  to  reduce  BGS  commercial  revenues  in future  quarters  until  the
commercial airline industry environment recovers.

BGS revenues in 2019 increased by $1,412 million compared with 2018 due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts
revenue,  including  the  acquisition  of  KLX  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018  and  government  services  revenue,  partially  offset  by  lower  commercial
services revenue. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $80 million higher than the comparable period in
the prior year.

Table of Contents

Earnings From Operations

BGS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $2,247 million compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial services revenue as well
as  earnings  charges  in  2020,  including  $531  million  of  inventory  write-downs,  $178  million  of  related  impairments  of  distribution  rights  primarily
driven by airlines' decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115
million  of  contract  termination  and  facility  impairment  charges,  as  well  as  $72  million  of  severance  costs.  These  charges  reflect  the  significant
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airline customers’ liquidity and demand for certain products as customers' fleet plans evolve to
adapt to the sharp reduction in demand for air travel. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was consistent with
the prior year.

BGS  earnings  from  operations  in  2019  increased  by  $161  million  compared  with  2018  primarily  due  to  higher  revenues,  partially  offset  by  less
favorable  performance  and  mix.  Earnings  from  operations  for  2019  also  includes  a  divestiture  gain  of  $395  million  and  a  charge  of  $293  million
related  to  our  decision  in  the  fourth  quarter  to  retire  the  Aviall  brand  and  trade  name.  The  favorable  impact  of  cumulative  contract  catch-up
adjustments in 2019 was $21 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.

Backlog

BGS  total  backlog  of  $20,632  million  at  December  31,  2020  decreased  by  10%  from  $22,902  million  at  December  31,  2019,  primarily  due  to  a
reduction for commercial orders that, in our assessment, no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog.

Boeing Capital

Business Environment and Trends

BCC’s gross  customer  financing  and investment  portfolio  at December  31, 2020 totaled  $1,974 million.  A substantial  portion  of BCC’s portfolio  is
related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing
aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.

BCC provided customer financing of $14 million and $419 million during 2020 and 2019. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft
deliveries  in  2021  and/or  provide  refinancing  for  existing  bridge  debt,  we  expect  alternative  financing  will  be  available  at  reasonable  prices  from
broad and globally diverse sources.

Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 7,300 western-built
commercial  jet  aircraft  (29.4%  of  current  world  fleet)  were  parked  at  the  end  of  2020,  including  both  in-production  and  out-of-production  aircraft
types.  Of  these  parked  aircraft,  a  larger  portion  are  expected  to  be  retired  compared  to  the  pre-COVID-19  period,  which  directly  impacts  the
Company  in  terms  of  number  of  new  aircraft  deliveries  and  financing  opportunities,  the  ability  of  existing  customers  to  meet  current  payment
obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2019 and 2018,
8.5% and 6.7% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft,
particularly  types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of  service.  See  Overview  to  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.

BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and
notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2020 increased by $17 million compared with 2019 primarily due to gains on re-lease of assets. BCC’s
revenues in 2019 decreased by $30 million compared with 2018 primarily due to lower gains on the sale of assets.

Earnings From Operations

BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation
on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2020 increased by $35 million compared with 2019 primarily due to
higher  revenues,  lower  asset  impairment  expenses  and  lower  interest  expenses.  Earnings  from  operations  in  2019  decreased  by  $51  million
compared with 2018 primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expenses.

BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 decreased from December 31, 2019, primarily due to $321 million of note
payoffs and portfolio run-off.

BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and
other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.

Leased aircraft with a carrying value of approximately $57 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2021. We are seeking to remarket
these aircraft or have the leases extended.

Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion during 2020, compared with net cash used by operating activities of
$2.4  billion  during  2019  and  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  of  $15.3  billion  in  2018.  The  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows  in  2020  is
primarily driven by our net loss in 2020 and changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the
$6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020, which was recorded as a reduction to inventory. The year-over-year increase in non-
cash  items  also  reflects  higher  inventory  write-downs  and  higher  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses  in  2020.  The  changes  in  working  capital
reflect increases in commercial airplane inventory due to the large number of undelivered aircraft in 2019 resulting from the 737 MAX grounding, and
in  2020  due  to  the  737  MAX  grounding,  787  production  issues  and  COVID-19  impacts.  Cash  used  by  Advances  and  progress  billings  was
$1.1 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided by Advances and progress billings in 2019. The changes in working capital in 2020 also
reflect lower accounts payable due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation payments
to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during 2020 and $1.2 billion during 2019. The accrued liability for 737 MAX customer considerations at
December 31, 2019 resulted in a $7.4 billion favorable change to working capital in 2019. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX
grounding are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on our operating cash flows during 2021.

The  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows  in  2019  compared  to  2018  primarily  reflected  the  impacts  of  the  737  MAX  grounding  resulting  in  lower
earnings, higher inventory and lower advances and progress payments. In addition, compensation payments to 737 MAX customers of $1.2 billion
for disruption to their operations also reduced 2019 cash from operating activities. Cash used to fund inventory was $12.4 billion during 2019 as we
continued to produce aircraft while deliveries were suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion in 2019, compared
with $2.6 billion in 2018.

Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020,
and increased by $2.6 billion and $0.6 billion for the same period in 2019 and 2018. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The
decline for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the years
ended  December  31,  2019  and  2018  reflects  a  combination  of  higher  purchases,  an  extension  of  payment  terms  with  certain  suppliers,  and
increased utilization of our supply chain financing programs.

Table of Contents

Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $18.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $4.6 billion. The increase in
cash outflows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions to investments. The reduction in cash outflows in
2019 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of
cash acquired were $0.5 billion in 2019, primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositions was $0.5 billion in 2019 as a result of
the  divestiture  of  two  businesses.  Capital  expenditures  totaled  $1.3  billion  in  2020,  compared  with  $1.8  billion  in  2019  and  $1.7  billion  2018.  We
expect capital expenditures in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2020. Net contributions to investments were $17.3 billion in 2020, compared with
net proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019 and $0.3 billion in 2018.

Financing Activities Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $35.0  billion  during  2020,  compared  with  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  of
$5.7 billion in 2019 and cash used by financing activities of $11.7 billion in 2018. The increase of $29.3 billion compared with 2019 primarily reflects
higher  net  borrowings,  lower  share  repurchases,  and  lower  dividend  payments.  Cash  provided  by  financing  activities  increased  $17.5  billion
compared  with  2018  primarily  due  to  higher  net  borrowings  and  lower  share  repurchases,  partially  offset  by  higher  dividend  payments  in  2019.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3 billion compared with $13.2 billion and $1.4
billion in the same period in 2019 and 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8
billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw term loan agreement entered into in the first quarter of 2020. For further discussion see
Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

At  December  31,  2020  and  2019  the  recorded  balance  of  debt  was  $63.6  billion  and  $27.3  billion,  of  which  $1.7  billion  and  $7.3  billion  were
classified as short-term. This included $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $0.9 billion
and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program compared to
repurchases  of  6.9  million  and  26.1  million  shares  in  2019  and  2018  totaling  $2.7  billion  and  $9.0  billion.  Share  repurchases  under  this  plan  had
been suspended since April 2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's
outstanding common stock. We had 0.6 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2020, 2019,
and 2018, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we paid dividends of $1.2 billion compared with $4.6 billion and $3.9
billion in  the  same  period  in  2019 and  2018.  In  March  2020,  the  Company  announced  that  our  dividend  will be  suspended  until  further  notice.  In
December  2018  we  increased  our  quarterly  dividend  from  $1.71  to  $2.055,  which  resulted  in  $684  million  of  higher  dividend  payments  in  2019
compared with 2018.

Capital Resources The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 737 MAX grounding are having a significant negative impact on our liquidity and
ongoing operations and creating significant uncertainty. We have and are continuing to take significant actions to manage and preserve our liquidity.
For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2020, we had $7.8 billion of cash and $17.8 billion of short term investments. At December 31, 2020, we had $9.5 billion of unused
borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our
general  corporate  borrowing  needs.  The  $9.5  billion  of  unused  borrowing  capacity  includes  a  $3.1  billion  364-day  revolving  credit  facility,  which
expires in October 2021. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2020, compared to commercial paper borrowings of $6.1 billion
and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement.

Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require
additional  funding  in  order  to  pay  off  existing  debt,  address  further  impacts  to  our  business  related  to  market  developments,  fund  outstanding
financing commitments, or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have
greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a
decline  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings,  including  impacts  described  above  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and/or
associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and  services.  These  risks  will  be  particularly  acute  if  we  are  subject  to  further  credit  rating
downgrades.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and  financing  or  contractual
commitments.

Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with
the  covenants  for  our  debt  and  credit  facilities.  The  most  restrictive  covenants  include  a  limitation  on  mortgage  debt  and  sale  and  leaseback
transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a
percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.

Customer financing commitments totaled $11.5 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decrease primarily relates to financing
commitment amendments and expirations. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as
we  continue  to  work  with  third  party  financiers  to  provide  alternative  financing  to  customers.  Historically,  we  have  not  been  required  to  fund
significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than
historically required.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our pension plans were $13.7 billion and $15.9 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2020. We do not expect to make significant
contributions to our pension plans in 2021. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began using
our  common  stock  in  lieu  of  cash  to  fund  Company  contributions  to  our  401(k)  plans  for  the  foreseeable  future,  which  we  estimate  will  conserve
approximately $1 billion of cash over the next 12 months. Under this approach, common stock is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay
period.  We  expect  this  measure  to  further  enable  the  Company  to  conserve  cash.  We  have  retained  an  independent  fiduciary  to  manage  and
liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.

Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2020, we have uncertain tax positions of $966 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash
flows related to uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits Pension  cash  requirements  are  based  on  an  estimate  of  our  minimum  funding  requirements,
pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based
on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.

Purchase Obligations Purchase  obligations  represent  contractual  agreements  to  purchase  goods  or  services  that  are  legally  binding;  specify  a
fixed,  minimum  or  range  of  quantities;  specify  a  fixed,  minimum,  variable,  or  indexed  price  provision;  and  specify  approximate  timing  of  the
transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position.

Purchase  Obligations  Not  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position Purchase  obligations  not  recorded  on  the
Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  include  agreements  for  inventory  procurement,  tooling  costs,  electricity  and  natural  gas  contracts,
property,  plant  and  equipment,  customer  financing  equipment,  and  other  miscellaneous  production  related  obligations.  The  most  significant
obligation  relates  to  inventory  procurement  contracts.  We  have  entered  into  certain  significant  inventory  procurement  contracts  that  specify
determinable  prices  and  quantities,  and  long-term  delivery  timeframes.  In  addition,  we  purchase  raw  materials  on  behalf  of  our  suppliers.  These
agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for
such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion
of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers
for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program
and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our
best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.

Purchase  Obligations  Recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position Purchase  obligations  recorded  on  the  Consolidated
Statements  of  Financial  Position  primarily  include  accounts  payable  and  certain  other  current  and  long-term  liabilities  including  accrued
compensation.

Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to
facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of
goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for
supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments
may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could
be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2020, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2020, we
have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $26.4 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with
industrial  participation  agreements  are  included  in  purchase  obligations  in  the  table  above.  To  be  eligible  for  such  a  purchase  order  commitment
from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.

Commercial  aircraft  financing  commitments  include  commitments  to  provide  financing  related  to  aircraft  on  order,  under  option  for  deliveries  or
proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on
historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no
assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contingent Obligations

We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:

Legal Various  legal  proceedings,  claims  and  investigations  are  pending  against  us.  Legal  contingencies  are  discussed  in  Note  21  to  our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Remediation We  are  involved  with  various  environmental  remediation  activities  and  have  recorded  a  liability  of  $565  million  at
December 31, 2020. For additional information, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 14 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Measures

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America
(GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as
a  substitute  for  the  related  GAAP  measures,  and  other  companies  may  define  such  measures  differently.  We  encourage  investors  to  review  our
financial  statements  and  publicly-filed  reports  in  their  entirety  and  not  to  rely  on  any  single  financial  measure.  Core  operating  earnings,  core
operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the
difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core
earnings  per  share  excludes  both  the  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment  and  non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses.  Non-operating
pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit  costs  other  than  service  cost.  Pension  costs,  comprising
service  and  prior  service  costs  computed  in  accordance  with  GAAP  are  allocated  to  BCA  and  certain  BGS  businesses  supporting  commercial
customers.  Pension  costs  allocated  to  BDS  and  BGS  businesses  supporting  government  customers  are  computed  in  accordance  with  U.S.
Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs
are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally
based on benefits paid.

The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2020 was a benefit of $1,024 million, largely
consistent with a benefit of $1,071 million in 2019 and $1,005 million in 2018. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was
a benefit of $340 million in 2020, $374 million in 2019 and $143 million in 2018. The benefits in 2020, 2019, and 2018 reflect expected returns in
excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses.

For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 30 - 31 of this Form 10-K
and see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings
per  share  for  purposes  of  evaluating  and  forecasting  underlying  business  performance.  Management  believes  these  core  earnings  measures
provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent
costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates

Accounting for long-term contracts

Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct
performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service
of integration that we provide.

Accounting  for  long-term  contracts  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  the  total  sales,  costs,  and  profit  for  each  performance  obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported
as cost of sales.

Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated
and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding
contract  options,  change  orders,  incentive  and  award  provisions  associated  with  technical  performance,  and  price  adjustment  clauses  (such  as
inflation  or  index-based  clauses).  The  majority  of  these  long-term  contracts  are  with  the  U.S.  government  where  the  price  is  generally  based  on
estimated  cost  to  produce  the  product  or  service  plus  profit.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be
reimbursed  in  establishing  contract  price.  Total  cost  estimates  are  largely  based  on  negotiated  or  estimated  purchase  contract  terms,  historical
performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and
schedule  risk,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  business  volume  assumptions,  COVID-19  disruptions,  asset  utilization,  and
anticipated labor agreements.

Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these
estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales
and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an
adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net
unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by
$942 million, $111 million and $190 million, respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2020 were primarily due to reach-forward losses
incurred on the KC-46A Tanker program.

Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we
used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance,
or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract
performance obligations for all of 2020 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for
the year by approximately $330 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes
to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.

Program Accounting

Program  accounting  requires  the  demonstrated  ability  to  reliably  estimate  the  relationship  of  sales  to  costs  for  the  defined  program  accounting
quantity.  A  program  consists  of  the  estimated  number  of  units  (accounting  quantity)  of  a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term
production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make
reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and

53

Table of Contents

anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for
the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.

Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part
costs,  major  component  costs,  overhead  costs,  program  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs,  and  warranty  costs.  Estimation  of  the  accounting
quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters
of  intent  from  prospective  customers,  and  market  studies.  Total  estimated  program  sales  are  determined  by  estimating  the  model  mix  and  sales
price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices
for  all  undelivered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation  adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly.  Cost  estimates  are
based  largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated  contracts  with  suppliers,  historical  performance  trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic
projections.  Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/or
supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.

To  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  includes
reassessing  the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  margins  are  normally  recognized  on  a  prospective  basis;  however,  when
estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in
the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.

The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program.
Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and
other  non-recurring  costs,  new  commercial  aircraft  programs,  typically  have  lower  initial  margins  than  established  programs  and  a  higher  risk  for
reach-forward loss. Actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are
included  within  program  inventory  as  deferred  production  costs.  Deferred  production,  unamortized  tooling  and  other  non-recurring  costs  are
expected  to  be  fully  recovered  when  all  units  in  the  accounting  quantity  are  delivered  as  the  expected  unit  cost  for  later  deliveries  is  below  the
estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.

We now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in the
fourth  quarter  of  2020.  The  revised  schedule  and  the  reach-forward  loss  reflect  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global
certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the
aircraft’s  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand,  and  discussions  with  our  customers  with  respect  to  aircraft
delivery  timing.  These  factors  resulted  in  adjustments  to  production  rates  and  the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation
costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts.

Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, deliveries which are expected to begin in 2023 will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions to
the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss
are  recorded  immediately.  The  level  of  profitability  on  the  777X  program  will  be  subject  to  a  number  of  factors.  These  factors  include  continued
market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production
rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the
testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors

54

Table of Contents

could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods which may be material.

Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework, the 787 program has near breakeven gross
margins  at  December  31,  2020.  The  margins  reflect  reductions  in  the  production  rate  and  program  accounting  quantity  during  2020.  If  we  are
required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or  production  rates  or  experience  higher  than  anticipated  costs  or  delays  addressing
production issues and associated rework, or other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could record a reach-forward loss in future
periods which may be material.

The 747 and 767 programs also have near breakeven gross margins at December 31, 2020. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with these
programs, or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost, accounting quantity or future production rates were to change, we could
be required to record reach-forward losses in future periods which may be material.

737 MAX Grounding

In  2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orders
suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries resumed in
late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order.

Multiple  legal  actions  have  been  filed  against  us  as  a  result  of  the  accidents.  In  addition,  we  are  fully  cooperating  with  U.S.  government
investigations  related  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX  program,  including  an  investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the
outcome of which may be material. On January 6, 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice that
resolves the Department of Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. Other
than with respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that
may result given the current status of the lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.

In  the  preparation  of  our  financial  statements,  we  have  made  assumptions  regarding  outcomes  of  accident  investigations  and  other  government
inquiries, timing and conditions of return to service, the timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production rate
changes,  timing  and  sequence  of  future  customer  deliveries  as  well  as  outcomes  of  negotiations  with  customers  impacted  by  the  grounding.  We
have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2021 that should be included in program inventory and
those costs that should be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time,
they are highly uncertain and significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements.

In December 2020, we delivered 27 aircraft, in compliance with the FAA regulatory requirements. We have assumed that the remaining non-U.S.
regulatory approvals will occur and enable deliveries during the first half of 2021. We have approximately 425 airplanes in inventory as of December
31,  2020.  A  number  of  customers  have  requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX  aircraft,  and  we  are  remarketing  and/or
delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We now expect to deliver about half of the 737 MAX aircraft in inventory by the end of
2021. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions of regulatory approval
timing, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted.

Due to the grounding and associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries, we temporarily suspended 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020.
We resumed early stages of 737 MAX production in May 2020 and continued to produce at low rates through the end of 2020.

55

Table of Contents

In addition, we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by 400 units in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reductions to
planned production rates due to COVID-19 driven market uncertainties. As we are producing at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021,
we  expect  to  incur  approximately  $5.0  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  that  are  being  expensed  as  incurred.  The  slowdown  in  the  planned
production  rate  ramp-up  increased  expected  abnormal  costs  however  this  increase  was  offset  by  adjustments  to  the  determination  of  the  normal
production level due to COVID-19 impacts on customer demand, as well as cost reduction activities, including significant reductions in employment
levels. We expensed approximately $2.6 billion of abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.

In addition to impacts related to the 737 MAX accidents and subsequent grounding, the 737 program continues to be significantly impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on aircraft demand. These impacts have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumptions. We currently
expect  to  gradually  increase  the  production  rate  to  31  per  month  by  early  2022.  We  currently  assume  that  we  will  implement  further  gradual
production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have also created
significant uncertainty around the timing of deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in inventory. We may need to recognize additional costs associated with
remarketing and/or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory, which may reduce revenue and/or earnings in future periods.

We are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. We continue to reassess the
liability  for  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  reassessment  includes  updating
estimates to reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latest
information  based on engagements  with 737 MAX customers.  The remaining  liability  of $5.5 billion at December  31, 2020 represents  our  current
best  estimate  of  future  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers,  and  is  necessarily  based  on  a  series  of  assumptions.  It  is  subject  to
change in future quarters as negotiations with customers mature and timing and conditions of return to service are better understood.

Our assumptions reflect our current best estimate, but actual timing and conditions of return to service and resumption of deliveries could differ from
this estimate, the effect of which could be material. We are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or
a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the timing and conditions of return to service, uncertainties related to the impacts of
COVID-19  on  our  operations,  supply  chain  and  customers,  future  changes  to  the  production  rate,  supply  chain  impacts,  and/or  the  results  of
negotiations  with  particular  customers.  Any  such  impacts,  including  any  changes  in  our  estimates,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our
financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries
in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  the  continued  absence  of  revenue,  earnings,  and  cash  flows  associated  with  737  MAX
deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future production rate increases occur at a slower rate
or take longer than we are currently assuming we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would
decrease.  However,  while  any  prolonged  production  suspension  or  delays  in  planned  production  rate  increases  could  mitigate  the  impact  on  our
liquidity,  it  could  significantly  increase  the  overall  expected  costs  to  produce  aircraft  included  in the  accounting  quantity,  which  would reduce  737
program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.

Goodwill Impairments

We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we
evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely
than

56

Table of Contents

not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no
further testing is required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value
of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents
the amount of goodwill impairment.

We  generally  estimate  the  fair  values  of  the  related  operations  using  a  combination  of  discounted  cash  flows  and  market-based  valuation
methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales,
operating costs, and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and
delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change
the  amount  of  impairment  recorded,  if  any.  The  cash  flow  forecasts  are  adjusted  by  an  appropriate  discount  rate  derived  from  our  market
capitalization  plus  a  suitable  control  premium  at  the  date  of  evaluation.  Therefore,  changes  in  the  stock  price  may  also  affect  the  amount  of
impairment recorded, if any.

We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill.

As  a  result  of  the  continuing  significant  adverse  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Commercial  Services
businesses,  we  concluded  it  is  a  triggering  event  for  testing  whether  goodwill  recorded  by  our  Commercial  Airplanes  and  Commercial  Services
reporting  units  is  impaired.  At  December  31,  2020,  Commercial  Airplanes  has  $1,316  million  of  goodwill  and  Commercial  Services  has  $3,087
million.  We  performed  a  quantitative  test  and  determined  the  fair  values  of  our  Commercial  Airplane  and  Commercial  Services  reporting  units
substantially  exceeded  their  carrying  values  as  of  December  31,  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  we  also  estimated  the  fair  values  of  our  other
reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values.

We will continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in future quarters. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates, or decreases in the
value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Pension Plans

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees  transitioned  to  company-funded  defined  contribution  retirement  savings  plans  effective  January  1,  2019.  Accounting  rules  require  an
annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount
rate  and  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  Future  changes  in  assumptions  or  differences  between  actual  and  expected  outcomes  can
significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.

57

Table of Contents

The  projected  benefit  obligation  is  sensitive  to  discount  rates.  The  projected  benefit  obligation  would  decrease  by  $2,591  million  or  increase  by
$2,930  million  if  the  discount  rate  increased  or  decreased  by  25  basis  points.  A  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  would  not  have  a
significant  impact  on  pension  cost.  However,  net  periodic  pension  cost  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  asset  return.  A
decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2020 net periodic pension
cost by $145 million.

Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation Allowance

The Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,600 million at December 31, 2020, that can be used in future years to offset taxable income
and reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $9,430 million at December 31, 2020, that will partially offset
deferred  income  tax  assets  and  result  in  higher  taxable  income  in  future  years  and  increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether
future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in
which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or
settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.

On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not
(defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.

This  assessment,  which  is  completed  on  a  taxing  jurisdiction  basis,  takes  into  account  both  positive  and  negative  evidence.  A  recent  history  of
financial  reporting  losses  is  heavily  weighted  as  a  source  of  objectively  verifiable  negative  evidence.  Cumulative  pre-tax  losses  in  the  three-year
period  ending  with  the  current  quarter  is  considered  to  be  significant  negative  evidence  regarding  future  profitability.  If  cumulative  pre-tax  losses
adjusted for non-recurring items result in positive normalized earnings that would be considered an objectively verifiable source of positive evidence
of the ability of the company to generate positive earnings in the future. When there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized
earnings  and  a  return  to  operating  profitability  has  not  yet  been  demonstrated,  we  cannot  rely  on  projections  of  future  earnings  for  purposes  of
assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities
will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies
and  assessment  of  when  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  or  deductible  amounts  involves  significant  management  judgment  and  is
inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future
periods.

As described above, a recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence of the
Company’s  ability  to  generate  future  taxable  income  to  recover  deferred  tax  assets.  During  2019  and  2020  the  Company  generated  significant
losses  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  the  Company  reached  a  three-year  cumulative  pre-tax  loss  position.  We  expect  cumulative  three-year
losses to grow in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced by 2021 results. We also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income for
certain non-recurring  items and expect to reach a three-year  cumulative  loss position in 2021 as record earnings  in 2018 are replaced  with 2021
results.  For  purposes  of  assessing  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets,  the  Company  determined  that  it  could  not  include  future  projected
earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.

Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the
next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts

58

Table of Contents

related  to  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits  that  are  assumed  to  generate  significant  deductible  amounts  beyond  five  years.  The
Company’s  valuation  allowance  of  $3,094  million  at  December  31,  2020  primarily  relates  to  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligation
deferred tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. Because the
pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  are  recorded  to  both  continuing  operations  and  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI),  the
Company  recorded  a  portion  of  the  fourth  quarter  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  to  income  tax  expense  in  continuing  operations  ($2,513
million) and a portion to OCI ($196 million).

If the Company continues to generate losses and negative normalized earnings in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be
recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI. When income generation returns to more normal levels we can expect to see
the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings and/or OCI.

For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets
and  liabilities.  The  investors  in  our  fixed-rate  debt  obligations  do  not  generally  have  the  right  to  demand  we  pay  off  these  obligations  prior  to
maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a
$13.8 billion two-year delayed draw floating-rate term loan credit agreement. An increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates on this
floating-rate debt would increase or decrease our pre-tax earnings by $138 million over the next 12 months. Historically, we have not experienced
material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use
foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  firmly  committed  and  forecasted  foreign  denominated  payments  and
receipts  related  to  our  ongoing  business.  Foreign  currency  forward  contracts  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  At
December  31,  2020,  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  the  exchange  rate  in  our  portfolio  of  foreign  currency  contracts  would  have  increased  or
decreased our unrealized losses by $245 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,
such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions
being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.

Commodity Price Risk

We  are  subject  to  commodity  price  risk  relating  to  commodity  purchase  contracts  for  items  used  in  production  that  are  subject  to  changes  in  the
market  price.  We  use  commodity  swaps  and  commodity  purchase  contracts  to  hedge  against  these  potentially  unfavorable  price  changes.  Our
commodity  purchase  contracts  and  derivatives  are  both  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  market  price.  At  December  31,  2020,  a  10%  increase  or
decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $38 million. Consistent with
the use of these contracts

59

Table of Contents

to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively,
in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting
swaps do not create material market risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
(Dollars in millions, except otherwise stated)

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as
“Boeing,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities
that  are  required  to  be  consolidated.  All  significant  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.  As  described  in  Note  22,  we
operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS), and Boeing Capital
(BCC).  Effective  at  the  beginning  of  2020,  certain  programs  were  realigned  between  our  BDS  segment  and  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and
other. Amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Liquidity Matters

The  global  outbreak  of  COVID-19  and  the  grounding  of  the  737  MAX  airplane  are  having  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  are
expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an
unprecedented  shock  to  demand  for  air  travel,  creating  a  tremendous  challenge  for  our  customers,  our  business  and  the  entire  aerospace
manufacturing  and  services  sector.  We  currently  expect  it  will  take  approximately  three  years  for  travel  to  return  to  2019  levels  and  a  few  years
beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will
recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.

During 2020, net cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion, and we expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until commercial
deliveries ramp up. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into and fully drew on a $13.8 billion two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement
(delayed draw term loan facility). In the second quarter of 2020, we issued $25 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2023 and 2060.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued $4.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes that mature between 2024 and 2031. As a result, our cash and short-
term investment balance was $25.6 billion and our debt balance was $63.6 billion at December 31, 2020.

The major credit rating agencies downgraded our short term and long term credit ratings during 2020, and there is risk for further downgrades. At
December  31,  2020,  our  debt  balance  includes  no  commercial  paper  borrowings  compared  to  $6.1  billion  at  December  31,  2019.  In  the  current
environment, we may have limited future access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we have term notes of $1.5 billion maturing in 2021.

At December 31, 2020, trade payables included $3.8 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs.
While access to supply chain financing has been reduced due to our current credit ratings and debt levels, we do not believe that these or future
changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.

At December 31, 2020, we had $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will
primarily  serve  as  back-up  liquidity  to  support  our  general  corporate  borrowing  needs.  Our  borrowing  capacity  includes  a  $3.1  billion  364-day
revolving credit facility, which is set to expire in October 2021.

Table of Contents

In addition to our debt issuances, we have taken a number of actions to improve liquidity. During the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors
terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and/or payment
of  dividends  until  further  notice.  We  have  also  reduced  production  rates  in  our  commercial  business  to  reflect  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the
industry.  We  are  executing  on  our  plans  to  reduce  our  workforce  through  a  combination  of  voluntary  and  involuntary  layoffs  and  natural
turnover. During 2020, we recorded severance costs for approximately 26,000 employees, of which approximately 18,000 have left the Company as
of December 31, 2020, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began using our common stock in lieu of
cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans. In December 2020, we awarded most of our employees a one-time stock grant that will vest
in three years in lieu of merit increases. We expect these actions to further enable the Company to conserve cash.

We are also working with our customers and supply chain to accelerate receipts and conserve cash. For example, the United States Department of
Defense  (U.S.  DoD)  has  taken  steps  to  work  with  its  industry  partners  to  increase  liquidity  in  the  form  of  increased  progress  payment  rates  and
reductions in withholds among other initiatives. We are also deferring certain tax payments pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act.

We have reduced discretionary spending, including reducing or deferring research and development and capital expenditures.

In  July  2020,  we  announced  our  business  transformation  efforts  to  assess  our  business  across  five  key  pillars  –  infrastructure,  overhead  and
organization, portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overall
facility requirements in light of reduced demand in our commercial businesses and remote and virtual work opportunities for large numbers of our
workforce. We also anticipate a reduction in office space needs compared to our current capacity. However, as we consolidate our footprint, we may
incur near term adverse impacts to earnings. The overhead and organization pillar is focused on our cost structure and how we are organized so we
can right size our workforce and simplify and reduce management layers and bureaucracy. The portfolio and investments pillar includes aligning our
portfolio and investments to focus on our core business and the changes in market conditions. The supply chain pillar is focused on supply chain
health and stability, reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining our transportation, logistics and warehousing approach. The operational
excellence  pillar  is  focused  on  improving  performance,  enhancing  quality  and  reducing  rework.  These  activities  are  not  intended  to  constrain  our
capacity, but to enable the Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers.

Based  on  our  current  best  estimates  of  market  demand,  planned  production  rates,  timing  of  cash  receipts  and  expenditures,  our  ability  to
successfully implement further actions to improve liquidity as well as our ability to access additional liquidity, if needed, we believe it is probable that
we will be able to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  requires  management  to  make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that the accounting estimates
and assumptions are appropriate given the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,
however actual results could differ from those estimates.

69

Table of Contents

Operating Cycle

For  classification  of  certain  current  assets  and  liabilities,  we  use  the  duration  of  the  related  contract  or  program  as  our  operating  cycle,  which  is
generally longer than one year.

Standards Issued and Implemented

In  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  adopted  ASU  2016-13,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (Topic  326):  Measurement  of  Credit  Losses  on
Financial Instruments, using a modified retrospective method, which resulted in the recognition of allowances for credit losses on our Consolidated
Statement  of  Financial  Position  as  of  January  1,  2020  and  a  $162  cumulative-effect  adjustment  to  retained  earnings  to  align  our  credit  loss
methodology  with  the  new  standard.  The  standard  replaces  the  incurred  loss  impairment  methodology  under  Topic  310  with  a  methodology  that
reflects  expected  credit  losses  and  requires  the  use  of  a  forward-looking  expected  credit  loss  model  for  accounts  receivables,  loans,  and  certain
other financial assets. See Notes 5, 6, 9 and 14 for additional disclosures.

In the first quarter of 2020, we also adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
The  standard  simplifies  the  quantitative  impairment  test  from  a  two-step  process  to  a  one-step  process.  The  quantitative  test  is  performed  by
comparing the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying
value,  the  shortfall  up  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  goodwill  represents  the  amount  of  goodwill  impairment.  The  standard  continues  to  permit  a
company to test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using the quantitative test.

Revenue and Related Cost Recognition

Commercial  aircraft  contracts  The  majority  of  our  BCA  segment  revenue  is  derived  from  commercial  aircraft  contracts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft
performance  obligation  based  on  relative  standalone  selling  prices  adjusted  by  an  escalation  formula  as  specified  in  the  customer  agreement.
Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the
customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.

In  certain  situations,  where  an  aircraft  is  still  in  our  possession,  and  title  and  risk  of  loss  has  passed  to  the  customer  (known  as  a  bill-and-hold
arrangement), revenue will be recognized when all specific requirements for transfer of control under a bill-and-hold arrangement have been met.

Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and
additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and
progress  billings  (contract  liabilities)  are  normal  and  customary  for  commercial  aircraft  contracts  and  not  considered  a  significant  financing
component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.

Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other
customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity
products,  surveillance  suites,  advanced  weapons,  missile  defense,  military  derivative  aircraft,  satellite  systems,  and  modification  of  commercial
passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Services sales under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated
with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.

70

Table of Contents

For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction
price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone
selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated
nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-
term  contracts  may  be  modified  over  their  life,  the  transaction  price  is  based  on  current  rights  and  obligations  under  the  contract  and  does  not
include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for
the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs
incurred  plus  an  agreed  upon  profit.  The  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  provide  guidance  on  the  types  of  cost  that  will  be  reimbursed  in
establishing  the  price  for  contracts  with  the  U.S.  government.  Certain  long-term  contracts  include  in  the  transaction  price  variable  consideration,
such  as incentive  and award  fees,  if specified  targets  are achieved.  The amount  included in the transaction  price represents  the expected  value,
based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.

Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services
are  rendered.  We  generally  recognize  revenue  over  time  as  we  perform  on  long-term  contracts  because  of  continuous  transfer  of  control  to  the
customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the
customer  to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in
process.  Similarly,  for  non-U.S.  government  contracts,  the  customer  typically  controls  the  work  in  process  as  evidenced  either  by  contractual
termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not
have an alternative use to the Company.

The  accounting  for  long-term  contracts  involves  a  judgmental  process  of  estimating  total  sales,  costs  and  profit  for  each  performance  obligation.
Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to
the  amount  reported  as  cost  of  sales.  Recognizing  revenue  as  costs  are  incurred  provides  an  objective  measure  of  progress  on  the  long-term
contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.

Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment
which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-
of-completion. When the current estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward
loss on the long-term contract is recognized.

Net  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  prior  years'  revenue  and  earnings,  including  certain  reach-forward  losses,  across  all  long-term  contracts
were as follows:

(Decrease)/Increase to Revenue
Increase to Loss/decrease to Earnings from operations
Decrease to Diluted EPS

2020

($359)
($942)
($1.37)

2019

Significant adjustments during the three years ended December 31, 2020 included reach-forward losses of $953, $148 and $736 on KC-46A Tanker
recorded during 2020, 2019, and 2018, as well as reach-forward losses on Commercial Crew of $489 during 2019.

71

Table of Contents

Due  to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process,  changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  or
circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.

Payments  under  long-term  contracts  may  be  received  before  or  after  revenue  is  recognized.  The  U.S.  government  customer  typically  withholds
payment  of  a  small  portion  of  the  contract  price  until  contract  completion.  Therefore,  long-term  contracts  typically  generate  Unbilled  receivables
(contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and
progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in
the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.

Commercial  spare  parts  contracts Certain  contracts  at  our  BGS  segment  include  sales  of  commercial  spare  parts.  For  each  contract,  we
determine the transaction  price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair
value.  We  generally  consider  each  spare  part  to  be  a  separate  performance  obligation.  Revenue  is  recognized  for  each  commercial  spare  part
performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part
where  a  customer  may  receive  a  full  or  partial  refund,  a  credit  applied  to  amounts  owed,  a  different  product  in  exchange,  or  any  combination  of
these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at
average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.

Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance,
training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services
are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the
transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.

Concession  Sharing  Arrangements We  account  for  sales  concessions  to  our  customers  in  consideration  of  their  purchase  of  products  and
services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions
incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements,
which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.

Unbilled Receivables and Advances and Progress Billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue
for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when
the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress
billings is determined for each contract.

Financial  Services  Revenue We  record  financial  services  revenue  associated  with  sales-type/finance  leases,  operating  leases,  and  notes
receivable.

Lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type/finance
leases, we record financing receivables at lease inception. A financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments,
estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of
the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date
full  recovery  of  income  and  principal  becomes  not  probable.  Income  is  recognized  when  financing  receivables  become  contractually  current  and
performance is demonstrated by the customer. Residual

72

Table of Contents

values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased
equipment.  Actual  residual  values  realized  could  differ  from  these  estimates.  Declines  in  estimated  residual  value  that  are  deemed  other-than-
temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.

For  operating  leases,  revenue  on  leased  aircraft  and  equipment  is  recorded  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  term  of  the  lease.  Operating  lease
assets, included in Customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated
residual  value,  using  the  straight-line  method.  We  periodically  review  our  estimates  of  residual  value  and  recognize  forecasted  changes  by
prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.

For notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization
of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.

Reinsurance  Revenue Our  wholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary,  Astro  Ltd.,  participates  in  a  reinsurance  pool  for  workers’  compensation.  The
member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $129,
$151  and  $145  during  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Reinsurance  costs  related  to  premiums  and  claims  paid  to  the  reinsurance  pool  were
$136,  $150  and  $136  during  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  Revenues  and  costs  are  presented  net  in  Cost  of  sales  in  the  Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Fleet Support

We  provide  assistance  and  support  to  facilitate  efficient  and  safe  aircraft  operation  to  the  operators  of  all  our  commercial  airplane  models.
Collectively known as fleet support, these activities and support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering
support, and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and
technical  consulting  support.  This  activity  continues  throughout  the  aircraft’s  operational  life.  Services  provided  after  delivery  include  field  service
support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering
data,  and  the  issuance  of  service  bulletins  that  impact  the  entire  model’s  fleet.  Field  service  support  involves  our  personnel  located  at  customer
facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as Cost of services.

Research and Development

Research  and  development  includes  costs  incurred  for  experimentation,  design,  and  testing,  as  well  as  bid  and  proposal  efforts  related  to
government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers.
Costs  that  are  incurred  pursuant  to  such  contractual  arrangements  are  recorded  over  the  period  that  revenue  is  recognized,  consistent  with  our
contract  accounting  policy.  We  have  certain  research  and  development  arrangements  that  meet  the  requirement  for  best  efforts  research  and
development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense
rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $224, $214 and $234 in 2020, 2019 and
2018, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation

We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based
on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation

73

Table of Contents

expense based on the fair value at each reporting  date  net of estimated  forfeitures.  The expense is recognized over the requisite  service period,
which is generally the vesting period of the award.

Income Taxes

Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported (Loss)/earnings before income taxes based on
current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining
deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Such  provisions  differ  from  the  amounts  currently  receivable  or  payable  because  certain  items  of  income  and
expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in
determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.

The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
positions  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.  We  record  a  liability  for  the  difference  between  the  benefit  recognized  and  measured  for
financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax
positions  changes,  the  change  in  estimate  is  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  determination  is  made.  Tax-related  interest  and  penalties  are
classified as a component of Income tax benefit/(expense).

We  also  assess  the  likelihood  that  we  will  be  able  to  recover  our  deferred  tax  assets  against  future  sources  of  taxable  income  and  reduce  the
carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of such assets will not be realized. Changes in our estimates  and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an
increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensive income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.

Postretirement Plans

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. We also provide postretirement
benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the
pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits
are  also  based  on  the  employee’s  annual  earnings.  The  net  periodic  cost  of  our  pension  and  other  postretirement  plans  is  determined  using  the
projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return,
and  medical  trend  (rate  of  growth  for  medical  costs).  A  portion  of  the  service  cost  component  of  net  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirement
income  or  expense  is  not  recognized  in  net  earnings  in  the  year  incurred  because  it  is  allocated  to  production  as  product  costs,  and  reflected  in
inventory at the end of a reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are
reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we
amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Postemployment Plans

We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable,
and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.

Environmental Remediation

We  are  subject  to  federal  and  state  requirements  for  protection  of  the  environment,  including  those  for  discharge  of  hazardous  materials  and
remediation  of  contaminated  sites.  We  routinely  assess,  based  on  in-depth  studies,  expert  analyses  and  legal  reviews,  our  contingencies,
obligations,  and  commitments  for  remediation  of  contaminated  sites,  including  assessments  of  ranges  and  probabilities  of  recoveries  from  other
responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental
remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is
based  on  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  exposure  for  investigation,  cleanup,  and  monitoring  costs  to  be
incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be
able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for
recovery is deemed probable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  highly  liquid  instruments,  such  as  commercial  paper,  time  deposits,  and  other  money  market  instruments,
which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and
reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable
were $74 and $101 at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Inventories

Inventoried  costs  on  commercial  aircraft  programs  and  long-term  contracts  include  direct  engineering,  production  and  tooling  and  other  non-
recurring  costs,  and  applicable  overhead,  which  includes  fringe  benefits,  production  related  indirect  and  plant  management  salaries  and  plant
services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed
costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs
include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one
year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.

Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs
incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs
are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor
and  other  resources)  than  units  produced  later  in  a  program  because  of  volume  efficiencies  and  the  effects  of  learning.  We  expect  that  these
deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is
below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from
suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.

The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete
all  contract  requirements.  When  actual  contract  costs  and  the  estimate  to  complete  exceed  total  estimated  contract  revenues,  a  loss  provision  is
recorded.  The  determination  of  net  realizable  value  of  commercial  aircraft  program  costs  is  based  upon  quarterly  program  reviews  that  estimate
revenue  and  cost  to  be  incurred  to  complete  the  program  accounting  quantity.  When  estimated  costs  to  complete  exceed  estimated  program
revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.

75

Table of Contents

Used aircraft purchased by the Commercial Airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value.
See ‘Aircraft Valuation’ within this Note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost
or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess
or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired
inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.

Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that
are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the
aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the
ability  to  recover  amounts  paid.  However,  to  the  extent  early  issue  sales  consideration  exceeds  advances  and  is  not  considered  to  be  otherwise
recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.

Precontract Costs

We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery
from  future  orders,  then  we  capitalize  the  precontract  costs  we  incur,  excluding  start-up  costs  which  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Capitalized
precontract  costs  are  included  in  Inventories  in  the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  Should  future  orders  not
materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  including  applicable  construction-period  interest,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  are
depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and
equipment, from 4 to 20 years. The principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and
machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years’ digits. Capitalized internal use software is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight
line method over 5 years. Capitalized software as a service is included in Other assets and amortized using the straight line method over the term of
the  hosting  arrangement  which  is  typically  no  greater  than  10  years.  We  periodically  evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  remaining  depreciable  lives
assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.

Long-lived  assets  held  for  sale  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.  Long-lived  assets  held  for  use  are  subject  to  an
impairment  assessment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  the  carrying
value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Leases We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  at  the  inception  date.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  Other  assets,  with  the
related  liabilities  included  in  Accrued  liabilities  and  Other  long-term  liabilities.  Assets  under  finance  leases,  which  primarily  represent  computer
equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term
debt and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments  arising  from  the  lease.  Operating  lease  assets  and liabilities  are  recognized  at  the  lease  commencement  date  based  on the  estimated
present

76

Table of Contents

value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.
Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities, and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and
not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we
will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal,
asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.

We  also  have  known  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations,  such  as  certain  asbestos  remediation  and  asset  decommissioning  activities  to  be
performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation.
Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in
the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s
fair  value.  In  addition,  there  may  be  conditional  asset  retirement  obligations  that  we  have  not  yet  discovered  (e.g.  asbestos  may  exist  in  certain
buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles

Goodwill  and  other  acquired  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  lives  are  not  amortized,  but  are  tested  for  impairment  annually  and  when  an  event
occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1.

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  by  performing  a  qualitative  assessment  or  using  a  quantitative  test.  If  we  choose  to  perform  a  qualitative
assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the
quantitative  test  is  then  performed;  otherwise,  no  further  testing  is  required.  For  operations  where  the  quantitative  test  is  used,  we  compare  the
carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the
shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.

Indefinite-lived  intangibles  consist  of  a  brand  and  trade  name  and  in-process  research  and  development  (IPR&D)  acquired  in  business
combinations. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. IPR&D
is  reclassified  to  finite-lived  acquired  intangible  assets  when  a  project  is  completed,  and  then  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  asset’s
estimated  useful life. We test these intangibles for impairment  by comparing the carrying values to current projections  of related discounted cash
flows. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.

Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology,
from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from
1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying

77

Table of Contents

value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Investments

Time deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.

Available-for-sale  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  U.S.  government  agency  securities,  and  corporate  debt  securities.  Available-for-sale
debt  securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded,  net  of  tax,  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other
comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized based on the specific identification method.
Available-for-sale debt securities are assessed for impairment quarterly.

The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between
20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.

Other  Equity  investments  are  recorded  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and  losses  recorded  through  net  earnings.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable  fair  value  are  measured  at  cost,  less  impairments,  plus  or  minus  observable  price  changes.  Equity  investments  without  readily
determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.

We  classify  investment  income  and  loss  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  based  on  whether  the  investment  is  operating  or  non-
operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including
our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on
the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-
strategic  purposes.  Earnings  from  non-operating  investments,  including  interest  and  dividends  on  marketable  securities,  and  any  impairments  or
gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in Other income/(loss), net.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them.
We  use  derivative  instruments  to  principally  manage  a  variety  of  market  risks.  For  our  cash  flow  hedges,  the  derivative’s  gain  or  loss  is  initially
reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted
transaction  affects  earnings.  We  have  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and
international  business  requirements.  These  agreements  are  derivatives  for  accounting  purposes  but  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting
treatment.  We  also  hold  certain  derivative  instruments  for  economic  purposes  that  are  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment.  For  these
aluminum  agreements  and  for  other  derivative  instruments  not  designated  for  hedge  accounting  treatment,  the  changes  in  their  fair  value  are
recorded in earnings immediately.

Allowances for losses on certain financial assets

We establish allowances for credit losses on accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, customer financing receivables, and certain other financial
assets.  The  adequacy  of  these  allowances  are  assessed  quarterly  through  consideration  of  factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  customer  credit
ratings, bankruptcy filings, published or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates

78

Table of Contents

and  collateral  exposures.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  and  determine  the  creditworthiness  of  each  customer  based  upon
publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers.  Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major
credit rating agencies.

Aircraft Valuation

Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for
the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used
aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain
customers  wherein  we  agree  to  repurchase  the  Sale  Aircraft  at  a  specified  price,  generally  10  to  15  years  after  delivery  of  the  Sale  Aircraft.  Our
repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If we execute an
agreement  for  the  sale  of  additional  new  aircraft,  and  if  the  customer  exercises  its  right  to  sell  the  Sale  Aircraft  to  us,  a  contingent  repurchase
commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-
in commitments.

Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:

(1) adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the
fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or

(2) charges  to  cost  of  products  for  adverse  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  trade-in  aircraft  that  occur  subsequent  to  signing  of  a  definitive
agreement  for  Sale  Aircraft  but  prior  to  the  purchase  of  the  used  trade-in  aircraft.  Estimates  based  on  current  aircraft  values  would  be
included in Accrued liabilities.

The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft
and  similar  models,  and  multiple  valuation  sources.  This  process  uses  our  assessment  of  the  market  for  each  trade-in  aircraft,  which  in  most
instances begins years before the return  of the aircraft.  There are several possible markets  in which we continually pursue opportunities to place
used  aircraft.  These  markets  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  resale  market,  which  could  potentially  include  the  cost  of  long-term  storage;  the
leasing  market,  with  the  potential  for  refurbishment  costs  to  meet  the  leasing  customer’s  requirements;  or  the  scrap  market.  Trade-in  aircraft
valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation
analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party  aircraft valuations
based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.

Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent
to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets
are included in Customer financing.

Customer financing Customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. Sales-type/finance
leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.

We  assess  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  we  own,  including  equipment  under  operating  leases,  assets  held  for  sale  or  re-lease,  and  collateral
underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less

79

Table of Contents

than  the  related  assets’  carrying  values.  Differences  between  carrying  values  and  fair  values  of  sales-type/finance  leases  and  notes  and  other
receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.

We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the
aircraft  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  aircraft.  Under  certain  circumstances,  we  apply  judgment  based  on  the  attributes  of  the  specific  aircraft  or
equipment,  usually  when  the  features  or  use  of  the  aircraft  vary  significantly  from  the  more  generic  aircraft  attributes  covered  by  outside
publications.

Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or
assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be
less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how
long  we  will  hold  an  asset  subject  to  operating  lease  before  it  is  sold,  the  expected  future  lease  rates,  lease  terms,  residual  value  of  the  asset,
periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life
of the asset. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over
the fair value of the asset.

Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables We  record  the potential  impairment  of customer  financing  receivables  in a valuation
account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of expected but unconfirmed losses. The allowance for losses on receivables relates to two
components of receivables: (a) receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b) all other receivables.

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is expected that we will be unable to collect amounts due
according  to  the  original  contractual  terms  of  the  receivable  agreement,  without  regard  to  any  subsequent  restructurings.  Factors  considered  in
assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We
determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the
related collateral we would expect to realize.

We  review  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  attributable  to  the  remaining  receivables  (after  excluding  receivables  subject  to  a  specific  impairment
allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the
excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the
carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer
credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. Internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each
customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers.

We have entered  into agreements  with certain  customers  that  would entitle  us to look beyond the specific  collateral underlying  the receivable  for
purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting
from  a  default  condition  be  insufficient  to  cover  the  carrying  value  of  our  receivable  (creating  a  shortfall  condition),  these  agreements  would,  for
example,  permit  us  to  take  the  actions  necessary  to  sell  or  retain  certain  other  assets  in  which  the  customer  has  an  equity  interest  and  use  the
proceeds to cover the shortfall.

80

Table of Contents

Each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft
value  publications  as  a  basis  to  validate  the  reasonableness  of  the  allowance  for  losses  on  receivables.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  actual
results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance
for losses on receivables.

Warranties

In conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material
and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our Commercial Airplanes segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-
year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under
our  authorization.  These  warranties  are  included  in  the  programs’  estimate  at  completion.  On  occasion  we  have  made  commitments  beyond  the
standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties
issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft  and weapons systems.  These sales are generally accompanied by a six
month  to  two-year  warranty  period  and  cover  systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  to  certain  contractual
specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty
liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times
the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims
level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.

We  provide  guarantees  to  certain  commercial  airplane  customers  which  include  compensation  provisions  for  failure  to  meet  specified  aircraft
performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known
and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets,
and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of
the  related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to  customers  for  failure  of  supplied
equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a
reduction  in  Cost  of  products  at  delivery  of  the  related  aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  the
programs’ estimate at completion.

Supplier Penalties

We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable. Until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.

Guarantees

We  record  a  liability  in  Accrued  liabilities  for  the  fair  value  of  guarantees.  For  credit  guarantees,  the  liability  is  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the
expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery,
if applicable. At inception of a guarantee, and adjusted each quarter, we also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $197 relating to trade names. During 2019,
we recorded an impairment of $293 within Cost of Sales, as a result of our decision to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. As of December 31,
2020 and 2019,  we had an indefinite-lived  intangible  asset  with a  carrying  amount  of $202 related  to in process  research  and development  for  a

Note 3 – Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings
per  share  for  common  shares  and  participating  securities.  The  undistributed  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating
securities as if all earnings had been distributed  during the period. Participating  securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed
earnings.

Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  taking  net  earnings,  less  earnings  available  to  participating  securities,  divided  by  the  basic  weighted
average common shares outstanding.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities,  divided by the diluted weighted
average common shares outstanding.

The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

    On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted, which includes a five year net operating
loss (NOL) carryback provision which enabled us to benefit from certain losses and re-measure certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the
former federal tax rate of 35%. In 2020, we recorded tax benefits of $1,175 related to the NOL carryback provision.

    In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $587 related to the settlement of the 2015-2017 federal tax audit. In the fourth quarter
of 2019, we recorded a tax benefit of $371 related to the settlement of state tax audits spanning 15 tax years. In the third quarter of 2018, we
recorded a tax benefit of $412 related to the settlement of the 2013-2014 federal tax audit.

    In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments of $82, $180 and $181, respectively.

In  2020,  2019  and  2018,  we  recorded  tax  benefits  related  to  foreign  derived  intangible  income  of  $31,  $229  and  $549,  respectively  which
effectively apply a lower U.S. tax rate to intangible income derived from serving non-U.S. markets.
During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018  and  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No.  118,  the
Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and recorded an incremental benefit related
to refinements to these provisional amounts which was not significant.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets of $11,600 can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The
Company’s deferred income tax liabilities of $9,430 will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years
and  increase  income  taxes  payable.  Tax  law  determines  whether  future  reversals  of  temporary  differences  will  result  in  taxable  and  deductible
amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally
are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities
relate  primarily  to  U.S.  federal  and  state  tax  jurisdictions.  From  a  U.S.  federal  tax  perspective  the  Company  does  not  have  any  significant  net
operating loss carryforwards nor does it have any significant federal tax credits that are at risk of expiring. The Company generated taxable income
in 2018 and 2019 and expects to have a tax net operating loss in 2020 that will be carried back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to the
CARES Act benefit as described above.

During  2019  and  2020  the  Company  generated  significant  pre-tax  losses  and  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  the  Company  reached  a  three-year
cumulative pre-tax loss position. We also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income for certain non-recurring items including certain 737
MAX  expenses,  an  agreement  with  the  Department  of  Justice,  severance  costs  and  remeasurement  gains  and  losses  from  the  annual
remeasurement  of  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations.  On  a  normalized  basis  the  Company  expects  to  reach  a  three-year
cumulative loss position in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced by 2021 results. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred

86

Table of Contents

tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.

As  of  December  31,  2020  the  Company  has  recorded  valuation  allowances  of  $3,094  primarily  for  certain  federal  deferred  tax  assets,  state  net
operating loss carryforwards, and state tax credits. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred
tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to determine the reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferred
tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and other
postretirement  benefit  obligations  are  assumed  to  reverse  and  generate  tax  deductions  over  the  next  15  to  20  years.  The  valuation  allowance
primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of
deferred  tax  assets.  Because  the  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  are  recorded  to  both  continuing  operations  and  other
comprehensive income (OCI), the Company recorded a portion of the fourth quarter increase in the valuation allowance to income tax expense in
continuing operations ($2,513) and a portion to OCI ($196). If the Company continues to generate losses and negative normalized earnings in future
periods,  additional  valuation  allowances  may  have  to  be  recorded  with  corresponding  adverse  impacts  on  earnings  and/or  OCI.  When  income
generation returns to more normal levels we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings and/or OCI.

The TCJA one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred
from  U.S.  income  taxes.  We  have  not  provided  for  foreign  withholding  tax  on  the  undistributed  earnings  from  our  non-U.S.  subsidiaries  because
such  earnings  are  considered  to  be  indefinitely  reinvested.  If  such  earnings  were  to  be  distributed,  any  foreign  withholding  tax  would  not  be
significant.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated
Statements  of  Financial  Position  were  not  significant.  The  amounts  of  interest  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations  were  not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

$1,287  and  $1,405  would  affect  the  effective  tax  rate,  if  recognized.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  these  amounts  are  primarily  associated  with  the
amount of research tax credits claimed and uncertainties in the TCJA.

Federal  income  tax  audits  have  been  settled  for  all  years  prior  to  2018.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  is  expected  to  begin the  2018-2019
federal tax audit in the first quarter of 2021. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2007-2019 tax
years. We

indemnifications to ULA in Note 14.

Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other includes capitalized precontract costs of $733 at December 31, 2020 and
$711 at December 31, 2019 primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew. See Note 13.

Commercial Aircraft Programs

The increase in commercial aircraft programs inventory during 2020 reflects the large number of undelivered aircraft due to the 737 MAX grounding,
lower wide-body deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues and associated rework, partially offset by a
reach-forward  loss  of  $6,493  on  the  777X  program.  At  December  31,  2020,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  includes  approximately  425
undelivered 737 MAX aircraft and 80 undelivered 787 aircraft.

We are currently remarketing certain aircraft and may have to remarket additional aircraft in future periods. If we are unable to successfully remarket
the aircraft, determine further production rates reductions are necessary, and/or contract the program accounting quantities, future earnings may be
reduced and/or additional reach-forward losses may have to be recorded.

At  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  737  program:  deferred
production costs of $2,159 and $1,313 and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $480 and $521. At December 31, 2020, $2,560 of
737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program
accounting quantity that have firm orders and $79 is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent
expected future orders.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: unamortized
tooling and other non-recurring costs of $3,295 and $2,914. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we determined that estimated costs to complete the
777X  program  plus  costs  already  included  in  777X  inventory  exceed  estimated  revenues  from  the  program.  The  resulting  reach-forward  loss  of
$6,493  was  recorded  as  a  reduction  to  deferred  production  costs.  As  a  result,  777X  deferred  production  costs  were  immaterial  at  December  31,
2020. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the
impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the
777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the
timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.

89

Table of Contents

At  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  the  following  amounts  related  to  the  787  program:  deferred
production costs of $14,976 and $18,716, $1,865 and $2,202 of supplier advances, and $1,863 and $2,092 of unamortized tooling and other non-
recurring costs. At December 31, 2020, $12,165 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected
to  be  recovered  from  units  included  in  the  program  accounting  quantity  that  have  firm  orders  and  $4,674  is  expected  to  be  recovered  from  units
included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders.

Commercial  aircraft  programs  inventory  included  amounts  credited  in  cash  or  other  consideration  (early  issue  sales  consideration)  to  airline
customers totaling $2,992 and $2,863 at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Note 8 – Contracts with Customers

Unbilled receivables decreased from $9,043 at December 31, 2019 to $7,995 at December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in billings at
BDS and BGS, as well as an increase in allowances for expected credit losses at BGS.

Advances  and  progress  billings  decreased  from  $51,551  at  December  31,  2019  to  $50,488  at  December  31,  2020,  primarily  driven  by  revenue
recognized  in  excess  of  advances  on  orders  received  and  return  of  BCA  customer  advances,  partially  offset  by  advances  on  orders  received  at
BCA, BDS, and BGS.

Revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the beginning
of each year were $10,360 and $16,778.

Certain commercial airplane customers are experiencing liquidity issues and seeking additional capital. Should these customers fail to address their
liquidity  issues,  accounts  receivable,  unbilled  receivables  and  certain  inventory  could  become  impaired.  In  addition  we  would  have  to  remove
contracts related to these customers from backlog and remarket any undelivered aircraft.

We acquire aircraft to be leased to customers through trades, lease returns, purchases in the secondary market, and new aircraft transferred from
our  BCA  segment.  Leasing  arrangements  typically  range  in  terms  from  1  to  12  years  and  may  include  options  to  extend  or  terminate  the  lease.
Certain leases include provisions to allow the lessee to purchase the underlying aircraft at a specified price. A minority of leases contain variable
lease payments based on actual aircraft usage and are paid in arrears.

The components of investment in sales-type/finance leases at December 31 were as follows:

Minimum lease payments receivable
Estimated residual value of leased assets
Unearned income

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due
according  to  the  original  contractual  terms.  At  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  we  individually  evaluated  for  impairment  customer  financing
receivables of $391 and $400, of which $380 and $388 were determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired
receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables.

We  determine  a  receivable  is  past  due  when  cash  has  not  been  received  upon  the  due  date  specified  in  the  contract.  There  were  no  past  due
customer financing receivables as of December 31, 2020.

We evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable is
deemed uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement, sales-type
lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If a customer status
changes  to  non-accrual  after  commencement  or  is  a  direct  finance  lease  and  sufficient  collateral  is  available,  we  recognize  contractual  interest
income as payments are received to the extent payments exceed past due principal payments. If there is not sufficient collateral, then revenue is not
recognized until payments exceed the principal balance. Receivables in non-accrual status as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were
$380 and $388. Interest income received for the twelve and three months ended December 31, 2020 was $34 and $8.

The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Four primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer
financing  receivables  are  customer  credit  ratings,  default  rates,  expected  loss  rate  and  collateral  values,  which  may  be  adversely  affected  by
impacts  that  COVID-19  has  on  our  customers.  We  assign  internal  credit  ratings  for  all  customers  and  determine  the  creditworthiness  of  each
customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to
those used by the major credit rating agencies.

Our allowance for losses on receivables decreased from $8 to $5 on January 1, 2020 upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. See Note 6 – Allowances for
Losses on Financial Assets.

At December 31, 2020, our allowance related to receivables with ratings of CCC, B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged 26.0%,
7.4%, 3.0% and 0.2%, respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables.

Customer Financing Exposure

Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and
overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Certain collateral values are being adversely impacted by
the changes in market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance
lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in out-of-production aircraft and 747-8
aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.

In  2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orders
suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S.
resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order.

Multiple  legal  actions  have  been  filed  against  us  as  a  result  of  the  accidents.  In  addition,  we  are  fully  cooperating  with  U.S.  government
investigations  related  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX  program,  including  an  investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the
outcome of which may be material. Other than as described below with respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot

96

Table of Contents

reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the lawsuits, investigations
and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.

On  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  of
Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. Under the terms of the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United
States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided
that  we  comply  with  our  obligations  under  the  agreement.  The  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  requires  that  we  make  payments  totaling  $2.51
billion, which consist of (a) a $243.6 million criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 million in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of
those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1.77 billion to the Company’s airline customers for
harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments
to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program
and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms.
Of the payments described above, $1.77 billion has been included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations. We
expensed $743.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement.

During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  the  FAA  rescinded  the  order  that  grounded  737  MAX  aircraft  and  issued  an  Airworthiness  Directive  specifying
requirements  that  must  be  met  before  U.S.  carriers  can  resume  service,  including  installing  software  enhancements,  completing  wire  separation
modification, conducting pilot training and performing maintenance steps to prepare parked aircraft to fly again. The FAA also issued a Continued
Airworthiness Notification to the International Community, and published the 737 MAX training requirements. The FAA must approve 737 MAX pilot
training  program  revisions  for  each  U.S.  airline  operating  the  aircraft  and  has  indicated  its  intent  to  retain  its  authority  to  issue  airworthiness
certificates  and  export  certificates  of  airworthiness  for  all  new  737  MAX  aircraft  manufactured  subsequent  to  the  grounding  order.  The  Brazilian
National Civil Aviation Agency approved return of operations in the fourth quarter of 2020, and Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation
Safety Agency (EASA) approved return of operations in the first quarter of 2021.

In  December  2020,  we  delivered  27  aircraft,  in  compliance  with  the  FAA  regulatory  requirements  described  above.  We  have  assumed  that  the
remaining  non-U.S.  regulatory  approvals  will  occur  and  enable  deliveries  during  the  first  half  of  2021.  We  have  approximately  425  airplanes  in
inventory as of December 31, 2020. A number of customers have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAX aircraft, and we are
remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We now expect to deliver about half of the 737 MAX aircraft in
inventory by the end of 2021. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions
of regulatory approval timing, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted.

Due to the grounding and associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries, we temporarily suspended 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020.
We resumed early stages of 737 MAX production in May 2020 and continued to produce at low rates through the end of 2020.

In addition, we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by 400 units in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reductions to
planned production rates due to COVID-19 driven market uncertainties. As we are producing at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021,
we  expect  to  incur  approximately  $5  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  that  are  being  expensed  as  incurred.  The  slowdown  in  the  planned
production rate ramp-up increased expected abnormal costs, however this increase was offset by adjustments to the determination of the normal
production level due to COVID-19 impacts on customer demand, as well as cost reduction activities, including significant

97

Table of Contents

reductions in employment levels. We expensed $2,567 of abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.

In addition to impacts related to the 737 MAX accidents and subsequent grounding, the 737 program continues to be significantly impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on aircraft demand. These impacts have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumptions. We currently
expect  to  gradually  increase  the  production  rate  to  31  per  month  by  early  2022.  We  currently  assume  that  we  will  implement  further  gradual
production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have also created
significant uncertainty around the timing of deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in inventory. We may need to recognize additional costs associated with
remarketing and/or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory, which may reduce revenue and/or earnings in future periods.

We have also recorded additional expenses of $416 and $328 due to the 737 MAX grounding during 2020 and 2019, which include costs related to
storage, inventory impairment, pilot training, and software updates.

The following table summarizes changes in the 737 MAX customer concessions and other considerations liability during 2020.

We are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. We continue to reassess the
liability  for  estimated  potential  concessions  and  other  considerations  to  customers  on  a  quarterly  basis.  This  reassessment  includes  updating
estimates to reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latest
information  based  on  engagements  with  737  MAX  customers.  The  liability  represents  our  current  best  estimate  of  future  concessions  and  other
considerations  to  customers,  and  is  necessarily  based  on  a  series  of  assumptions.  It  is  subject  to  change  in  future  quarters  as  negotiations  with
customers mature and timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. The liability balance of $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020
includes $2.3 billion expected to be liquidated by lower customer delivery payments, $0.6 billion expected to be paid in cash and $0.1 billion in other
concessions.  Of the cash payments to customers,  we expect to pay $0.3 billion in 2021 and $0.3 billion in 2022. The type of consideration  to be
provided for the remaining $2.5 billion will depend on the outcomes of negotiations with customers.

The  737 MAX  remains  grounded  in  certain  non-U.S.  jurisdictions.  The  civil  aviation  authorities  in those  jurisdictions  will determine  the  timing  and
conditions  of  return  to  service.  Our  assumptions  reflect  our  current  best  estimate,  but  actual  timing  and  conditions  of  return  to  service  and
resumption  of  deliveries  could  differ  from  this  estimate,  the  effect  of  which  could  be  material.  We  are  unable  at  this  time  to  reasonably  estimate
potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the timing and conditions of return to
service,  uncertainties  related  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  our  operations,  supply  chain  and  customers,  future  changes  to  the  production  rate,
supply chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event

98

Table of Contents

that  we  are  unable  to  resume  aircraft  deliveries  in  non-U.S.  jurisdictions  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  the  continued  absence  of  revenue,
earnings, and cash flows associated with 737 MAX deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that
future production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming, we expect that the growth in inventory and
other  cash  flow  impacts  associated  with  production  would  decrease.  However,  while  any  prolonged  production  suspension  or  delays  in  planned
production  rate  increases  could  mitigate  the  impact  on  our  liquidity,  it  could  significantly  increase  the  overall  expected  costs  to  produce  aircraft
included in the accounting quantity, which would reduce 737 program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.

Commercial air traffic has fallen dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this trend has impacted passenger traffic most severely, near-
term  cargo  traffic  has  also  fallen  significantly  due  to  the  global  economic  downturn  and  the  reduction  in  cargo  capacity  on  passenger  airplanes.
Airlines  have  significantly  reduced  their  capacity,  and  many  could  implement  further  reductions  in  the  near  future.  Many  airlines  are  also
implementing significant reductions in staffing. These capacity changes are causing, and are expected to continue to cause, negative impacts to our
customers’  revenue,  earnings,  and  cash  flow,  and  in  some  cases  may  threaten  the  future  viability  of  some  of  our  customers,  potentially  causing
defaults  within  our  customer  financing  portfolio  and/or  requiring  us  to  remarket  aircraft  that  have  already  been  produced  and/or  are  currently  in
backlog. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded for an extended period of time in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we may experience additional reductions to
backlog  and/or  significant  order  cancellations.  Additionally,  we  may  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased  cancellations  across  all  of  our
commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand. Our customers may also lack sufficient
liquidity  to  purchase  new  aircraft  due  to  impacts  from  the  pandemic.  We  are  also  observing  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  requests  for
payment  deferrals,  contract  modifications,  lease  restructurings  and  similar  actions,  and  these  trends  may  lead  to  additional  earnings  charges,
impairments  and  other  adverse  financial  impacts  in  our  business  over  time.  In  addition,  to  the  extent  that  customers  have  valid  rights  to  cancel
undelivered aircraft, we may be required to refund pre-delivery payments, putting additional constraints on our liquidity. There is risk that the industry
implements  longer-term  strategies  involving reduced  capacity,  shifting  route  patterns,  and mitigation  strategies  related  to impacts  from  COVID-19
and the risk of future public health crises. In addition, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel.

As a result,  there  is significant  uncertainty  with  respect  to  when commercial  air traffic  levels will begin to recover,  and whether  and at what point
capacity  will  return  to  and/or  exceed  pre-COVID-19  levels.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  also  has  increased,  and  its  aftermath  is  also  expected  to
continue  to  increase,  uncertainty  with  respect  to  global  trade  volumes,  putting  significant  negative  pressure  on  cargo  traffic.  Any  of  these  factors
would have a significant  impact on the demand for both single-aisle and wide-body commercial  aircraft,  as well as for the services  we provide to
commercial  airlines.  In  addition,  a  lengthy  period  of  reduced  industry-wide  demand  for  commercial  aircraft  would  put  additional  pressure  on  our
suppliers,  resulting  in  increased  procurement  costs  and/or  additional  supply  chain  disruption.  To  the  extent  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or  its
aftermath  further  impacts  demand  for  our  products  and  services  or  impairs  the  viability  of  some  of  our  customers  and/or  suppliers,  our  financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected, and those impacts could be material.

The  liabilities  recorded  represent  our  best  estimate  or  the  low  end  of  a  range  of  reasonably  possible  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  to  remediate
sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these
recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the
discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that
includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our
experience  and  existing  laws  and  regulations.  There  are  some  potential  remediation  obligations  where  the  costs  of  remediation  cannot  be
reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our
recorded liabilities by $1,095 and $1,077.

The increase in the product warranty reserve during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is primarily driven by charges related to “pickle
forks” on 737NG aircraft. During 2019, we detected cracks in the "pickle forks", a frame fitting component of the structure connecting the wings to
the  fuselages  of  737NG  aircraft.  We  notified  the  FAA,  which  issued  a  directive  requiring  that  certain  737NG  airplanes  be  inspected.  We  have
estimated  the  number  of  aircraft  that  will  have  to  be  repaired  in  the  future  and  provisioned  for  the  estimated  costs  of  completing  the  repairs.  We
recognized  charges  of  $135  in  2019  for  current  and  projected  future  aircraft  repairs.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  recognized  additional
charges of $336 based on revised engineering and fleet utilization estimates as well as updated repair cost estimates. We cannot estimate a range
of reasonably possible losses, if any, in excess of amounts recognized due to the ongoing nature of the inspections and repairs and pending the
completion of investigations into the cause of the condition.

Commercial Aircraft Commitments

In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain
customers that give them the right to trade in used

100

Table of Contents

aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using
both  quantitative  information  from  valuation  sources  and  qualitative  information  from  other  sources.  The  probability  of  exercise  is  assessed
quarterly,  or  as  events  trigger  a  change,  and  takes  into  consideration  the  current  economic  and  airline  industry  environments.  Trade-in
commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement,
and require advance notice by the customer.

Trade-in  commitment  agreements  at  December  31,  2020  have  expiration  dates  from  2021  through  2028.  At  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  total
contractual  trade-in  commitments  were  $950  and  $1,407.  As  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  we  estimated  that  it  was  probable  we  would  be
obligated  to  perform  on  certain  of  these  commitments  with  net  amounts  payable  to  customers  totaling  $599  and  $711  and  the  fair  value  of  the
related trade-in aircraft was $580 and $678.

Financing Commitments

Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft,
totaled  $11,512  and  $13,377  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The  estimated  earliest  potential  funding  dates  for  these  commitments  as  of
December 31, 2020 are as follows:

$11,512

As  of  December  31,  2020,  all  of  these  financing  commitments  relate  to  customers  we  believe  have  less  than  investment-grade  credit.  We  have
concluded that  no reserve  for  future  potential  losses  is required  for  these  financing  commitments  based upon the terms,  such as collateralization
and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.

Funding Commitments

We have commitments to make additional capital contributions of $243 to joint ventures over the next seven years.

Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds

We  have  entered  into  standby  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  with  financial  institutions  primarily  relating  to  the  guarantee  of  our  future
performance  on  certain  contracts.  Contingent  liabilities  on  outstanding  letters  of  credit  agreements  and  surety  bonds  aggregated  approximately
$4,238 and $3,769 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Company Owned Life Insurance

McDonnell Douglas Corporation  insured its executives with Company Owned Life Insurance  (COLI),  which are life insurance policies with a cash
surrender value. Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this
time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of

101

Table of Contents

December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cash surrender value was $395 and $448 and the total loans were $382 and $431. As we have the right to offset
the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

United States Government Defense Environment Overview

The Omnibus appropriations acts for FY21, enacted in December 2020, provided FY21 appropriations for government departments and agencies,
including the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation
Administration.

The enacted FY21 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64
Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future
program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes,
including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing
contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.

BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts

Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the
work.  BDS  fixed-price  contracts  with  significant  development  work  include  Commercial  Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,
and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  The  operational  and  technical  complexities  of  these  contracts  create  financial  risk,  which  could  trigger
termination  provisions,  order  cancellations  or  other  financially  significant  exposure.  Changes  to  cost  and  revenue  estimates  could  result  in  lower
margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, we have recorded an increase in the reach-forward loss of $1,320 on KC-46A
Tanker in 2020. The KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss reflects $551 of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air
Force (USAF) to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, and the remaining costs reflect production inefficiencies including impacts of
COVID-19  disruption.  Moreover,  our fixed-price  development  programs  remain  subject  to additional reach-forward  losses  if we experience  further
production, technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs.

KC-46A Tanker

In  2011,  we  were  awarded  a  contract  from  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  to  design,  develop,  manufacture  and  deliver  four  next  generation  aerial
refueling  tankers.  This  Engineering,  Manufacturing  and  Development  (EMD)  contract  is  a  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  and  involves  highly
complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 67 aircraft.
The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $15 billion as of December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $463 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,281 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers. These
values were primarily related to 12 aircraft in lot 6 and 15 aircraft in lot 7 for which we received contract awards in January 2021.

Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts

Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands
related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve
for

102

Table of Contents

amounts  disputed.  If  we  are  unable  to  satisfactorily  resolve  disputed  costs,  we  could  be  required  to  record  an  earnings  charge  and/or  provide
refunds to the U.S. government.

Severance

The following table summarizes changes in the severance liability during 2020:

During 2020, the Company recorded severance costs for approximately 26,000 employees expected to leave the Company through a combination
of voluntary and involuntary terminations. The severance packages are consistent with the Company’s ongoing compensation and benefits plans.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 18,000 of the 26,000 employees have left the Company, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021.

Note 14 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.

The  following  table  provides  quantitative  data  regarding  our  third  party  guarantees.  The  maximum  potential  payments  represent  a  “worst-case
scenario,” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated
values  of  assets  we  could  liquidate  or  receive  from  other  parties  to  offset  our  payments  under  guarantees.  The  carrying  amount  of  liabilities
represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities.

Contingent  Repurchase  Commitments The  repurchase  price  specified  in  contingent  repurchase  commitments  is  generally  lower  than  the
expected  fair  value  at  the  specified  repurchase  date.  Estimated  proceeds  from  collateral/recourse  in  the  table  above  represent  the  lower  of  the
contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.

Indemnifications  to  ULA During  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  the  USAF  and  ULA  reached  a  settlement  regarding  previously  questioned  deferred
support and deferred production costs. As part of the settlement the USAF agreed to reimburse ULA for $307 of those costs, which was received by
ULA in the second quarter. Our indemnification to ULA associated with the recoverability of contributed assets

103

Table of Contents

expired on December 31, 2020, resulting in a $33 payment to the partnership. This settlement retires our indemnification risks to ULA.

Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our
BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating
to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted
under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments
under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are
probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 13.

Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original
lessee  or  debtor  does  not  make  payments  or  perform  certain  specified  services.  Generally,  these  guarantees  have  been  extended  on  behalf  of
guaranteed  parties  with  less  than  investment-grade  credit  and  are  collateralized  by  certain  assets.  Current  outstanding  credit  guarantees  expire
through 2036.

Industrial Revenue Bonds

Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at
our St. Louis site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from St. Louis County.
We  record  these  properties  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position.  We  have  also  purchased  the  IRBs  and  therefore  are  the
bondholders  as  well  as  the  borrower/lessee  of  the  properties  purchased  with  the  IRB  proceeds.  The  liabilities  and  IRB  assets  are  equal  and  are
reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $271.

Note 15 – Debt

In  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  we  entered  into  a  $13,825,  two-year  delayed  draw  term  loan  facility,  which  includes  additional  commitments  made
subsequent to the initial closing date. As of December 31, 2020, we have fully drawn on the 13,825 delayed draw term loan facility, with February 6,
2022 as the final maturity date. Borrowings outstanding bear interest at the Eurodollar rate (determined in accordance with the delayed draw term
loan facility agreement) plus between 0.75% and 1.25%, depending on our credit rating.

In the second quarter of 2020, we issued $25,000 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $3,000 due May 1, 2023 that bear an annual interest rate
of 4.508%, $3,500 due May 1, 2025 that bear an annual interest rate of 4.875%, $2,000 due May 1, 2027 that bear an annual interest rate of 5.04%,
$4,500 due May 1, 2030 that bear an annual interest rate of 5.15%, $3,000 due May 1, 2040 that bear an annual interest rate of 5.705%, $5,500 due
May 1, 2050 that bear an annual interest rate of 5.805%, and $3,500 due May 1, 2060 that bear an annual interest rate of 5.93%. The notes are
unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net
proceeds of the issuance totaled $24,802, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued $4,900 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $1,000 due February 1, 2024 that bear an annual interest rate
of 1.95%, $1,400 due February 1, 2026 that bear an annual interest rate of 2.75%, $1,100 due February 1, 2028 that bear an annual interest rate of
3.25%, and $1,400 due February 1, 2031 that bear an annual interest rate of 3.625%. The notes are unsecured

104

Table of Contents

senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds
of the issuance totaled $4,870, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.

Interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $2,280, $867 and $624 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Interest expense recorded by BCC is reflected as Boeing Capital interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total Company
interest payments were $1,925, $973 and $616 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We  have  $9,473  currently  available  under  credit  line  agreements,  of  which  $3,073  is  a  364-day  revolving  credit  facility  expiring  in  October  2021,
$3,200 expires in October 2022, and $3,200 expires in October 2024. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to
extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants
contained in our debt or credit facility agreements.

Many  of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Nonunion  and  the  majority  of  union  employees  that  had
participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union
employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019.

We fund our major pension plans through trusts. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans’ participants, and are structured
to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future
benefit payments.

We  also  have  other  postretirement  benefits  (OPB)  other  than  pensions  which  consist  principally  of  health  care  coverage  for  eligible  retirees  and
qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. Retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for
approximately two-thirds of those participants who are eligible for health care coverage. Certain employee groups, including employees covered by
most United Auto Workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. The funded status of the plans is measured as the
difference  between the plan assets  at fair value and the projected  benefit obligation  (PBO).  We have recognized  the aggregate  of all overfunded
plans in Other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either Accrued retiree health care or Accrued pension plan liability, net. The
portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next
12 months, is reflected in Accrued liabilities.

The discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans’ expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality
bonds that are rated as Aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. The yield curve is fitted to yields
developed  from  bonds  at  various  maturity  points.  Bonds  with  the  ten  percent  highest  and  the  ten  percent  lowest  yields  are  omitted.  The  present
value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.

The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to historical returns, the assumption represents a
long-term,  prospective  return.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  component  of  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for  the  upcoming  plan  year  is
determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the
accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31,
2020, the MRVA was approximately $6,805 less than the fair market value of assets.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension
plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment objectives for
our  long-term  investment  strategy  include  reducing  the  volatility  of  pension  assets  relative  to  pension  liabilities,  achieving  a  competitive  total
investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class
are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.

We periodically  update our long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations.  We use various  analytics  to determine  the optimal  asset  mix  and consider  plan
liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment
benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.
Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length
of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and
exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and
rebalanced frequently. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:

Fixed income  securities  are invested  primarily  in a diversified  portfolio  of long duration  instruments  as well as Emerging  Market,  Structured,  High
Yield and Private Debt. Global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, across various industries and
market capitalizations.

Private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (LPs) that mainly invest in U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital
and special situation strategies.  Real estate  and real assets include global private investments  that may be held through investments  in a limited
partnership (LP) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the case of real estate).
Real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. Real assets include, but are not limited to,
investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure.

Hedge  fund  investments  seek  to  capitalize  on  inefficiencies  identified  across  and  within  different  asset  classes  or  markets.  Hedge  fund  strategy
types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy.

Investment  managers  are  retained  for  explicit  investment  roles  specified  by  contractual  investment  guidelines.  Certain  investment  managers  are
authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. Derivatives are used to achieve the
desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes,

110

Table of Contents

achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.

As  a  percentage  of  total  pension  assets,  derivative  net  notional  amounts  were  8.3%  and  4.3%  for  fixed  income,  including  to-be-announced
mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 0.4% and 3.6% for global equity and commodities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

In November 2020, the Company contributed $3,000 of our common stock to the pension fund. An independent fiduciary was retained to manage
and liquidate the stock over time at its discretion. Plan assets included $3,298 and $0 of our common stock as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Risk Management In managing the pension assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk,
counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach
and  are  integral  to  the  overall  investment  strategy.  Further,  asset  classes  are  constructed  to  achieve  diversification  by  investment  strategy,  by
investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored
regularly  through  the  custodian.  Credit  parameters  for  counterparties  have  been  established  for  managers  permitted  to  trade  over-the-counter
derivatives.  Valuation  is  governed  through  several  types  of  procedures,  including  reviews  of  manager  valuation  policies,  custodian  valuation
processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.

Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair
value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on
quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  Level  2  refers  to  fair  values  estimated  using  significant  other  observable  inputs,  and  Level  3
includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Fixed  income  securities  are  primarily  valued  upon  a  market  approach,  using  matrix  pricing  and  considering  a  security’s  relationship  to  other
securities  for which quoted prices in an active market  may be available, or an income approach, converting  future  cash flows to a single present
value amount. Inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.

Common/collective/pooled  funds  are  typically  common  or  collective  trusts  valued  at  their  net  asset  values  (NAVs)  that  are  calculated  by  the
investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. Derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are
primarily  valued  using  an  income  approach  with  inputs  that  include  benchmark  yields,  swap  curves,  cash  flow  analysis,  rating  agency  data  and
interdealer  broker  rates.  Exchange-traded  derivative  positions  are  reported  in  accordance  with  changes  in  daily  variation  margin  which  is  settled
daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled
fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily
using  a  market  approach  with  inputs  that  include  quoted  market  prices  for  similar  instruments.  In  the  event  a  market  price  is  not  available  for
instruments  with  an  original  maturity  of  one  year  or  less,  amortized  cost  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  fair  value.  Common  and  preferred  stock  equity
securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.

Private  equity  and  private  debt  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,
operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. For those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis
(primarily LPs) we use NAVs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.

Real  estate  and  real  asset  NAV  valuations  are  based  on  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments,  which  include  inputs  such  as  cost,  discounted
future  cash  flows,  independent  appraisals  and  market  based  comparable  data.  For  those  investments  reported  on  a  one-quarter  lagged  basis
(primarily  LPs)  NAVs  are  adjusted  for  subsequent  cash  flows  and  significant  events.  Publicly  traded  REITs  and  infrastructure  stocks  are  valued
using a market  approach based on quoted market  prices of identical instruments.  Exchange-traded  commodities  futures  positions are reported  in
accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.

Hedge  fund  NAVs  are  generally  based  on  the  valuation  of  the  underlying  investments.  This  is  primarily  done  by  applying  a  market  or  income
valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held.

Investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the General Partner
(GP), fund manager or third party administrator. Additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and
are valued in a similar fashion. Pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the NAV of these investments as
the practical expedient for the valuations.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the changes in unrealized gains/(losses)  for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2020 were $2 for
corporate,  $1 for mortgage  backed and asset backed fixed income securities,  $3 for municipal  bonds and ($1) for sovereign. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, the changes in unrealized gains/(losses) for Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2019 were $10 for mortgage backed and
asset backed fixed income securities and ($1) for non-U.S. common and preferred stock equity securities.

OPB Plan Assets The majority of OPB plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and
40% debt securities. The index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (Level 1). The
expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.

Cash Flows

Contributions Required pension contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as well as rules governing funding of
our non-US pension plans, are not expected to be significant in 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3,000 in common stock to
the pension fund. We do not expect to make discretionary contributions to our pension plans in 2021.

Estimated  Future  Benefit  Payments The  table  below  reflects  the  total  pension  benefits  expected  to  be  paid  from  the  plans  or  from  our  assets,
including  both  our  share  of  the  benefit  cost  and  the  participants’  share  of  the  cost,  which  is  funded  by  participant  contributions.  OPB  payments
reflect our portion only.

Certain of the pension plans provide that, in the event there is a change in control of the Company which is not approved by the Board of Directors
and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required
by  ERISA,  and  then  any  surplus  will  be  used  to  fund  a  trust  to  continue  present  and  future  payments  under  the  postretirement  medical  and  life
insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.

Should we terminate certain pension plans under conditions in which the plan’s assets exceed that plan’s obligations, the U.S. government will be
entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plan’s assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under U.S. government contracts.

Defined Contribution Plans

We provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. The principal plans are the Company-sponsored 401(k) plans. The expense
for these defined contribution plans was $1,351, $1,533 and $1,480 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Note 17 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements

Share-Based Compensation

Our  2003 Incentive  Stock  Plan, as  amended  and restated,  permits  awards  of incentive  and non-qualified  stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,
restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to
our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance
under the plan is 87,000,000.

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent
there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy
these issuances during 2021.

Restricted Stock Units

In February 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted to our executives 325,108, 233,582 and 260,730 restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-
term  incentive  program  with grant date fair values of $319.04,  $428.22 and $361.13  per unit, respectively.  In December 2020, we granted  to our
executives 721,734 RSUs as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of $233.00 per unit. The RSUs granted under this
program  will  vest  and  settle  in  common  stock  (on  a  one-for-one  basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  executive  terminates
employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active
employment during the three-year service period, except in the case of the December 2020 grant, which will vest in full for executives that terminate
employment due to retirement after attaining certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock
units will terminate. These RSUs are labeled executive long-term incentive program in the table below.

In December 2020, we granted to our employees (excluding executives and certain union-represented employees), a one-time grant of 5,163,425
RSUs with a grant date fair value of $233.00 per unit. The RSUs granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one
basis)  on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  grant  date.  If  an  employee  terminates  employment  because  of  retirement,  layoff,  disability,  or  death,  the
employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active

employment  during  the  three-year  service  period.  In  all  other  cases,  the  RSUs  will  not  vest  and  all  rights  to  the  stock  units  will  terminate.  These
RSUs are labeled employee long-term incentive program in the table below.

In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant RSUs to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or
to  reward  various  achievements.  These  RSUs  are  labeled  other  RSUs  in  the  table  below.  The  fair  values  of  all  RSUs  are  estimated  using  the
average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs) are stock units that pay out based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to
a  group  of  peer  companies  over  a  three-year  period.  The  award  payout  can  range  from  0%  to  200%  of  the  initial  PBRSU  grant.  The  PBRSUs
granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant
date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under
the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. In all
other cases, the PBRSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

In February 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted to our executives 290,202, 214,651 and 241,284 PBRSUs as part of our long-term incentive program.
Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value. The grant date fair
values were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield
as the units earn dividend equivalents.

year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit for the 2019 and 2018 Performance Awards and $0 to $150 dollars for
2020 Performance Awards, depending on the Company’s performance against plan for a three-year period. The Compensation Committee has the
discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. Compensation expense, based on
the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.

The minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2020, 2019 and 2018 Performance Awards is
$274, $341 and $331, respectively.

Deferred Compensation

The  Company  has  deferred  compensation  plans  which  permit  certain  employees  to  defer  a  portion  of  their  salary,  bonus,  certain  other  incentive
awards, and retirement contributions. Participants can diversify these amounts among 23 investment funds including a Boeing stock unit account.

Total expense related to deferred compensation was $93, $174 and $19 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019,
the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,718 and $1,779.

Note 18 – Shareholders’ Equity

On  December  17,  2018,  the  Board  approved  a  repurchase  plan  for  up  to  $20,000  of  common  stock.  In  March  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors
terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares under this plan.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. No
preferred stock has been issued.

Note 19 – Derivative Financial Instruments

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency
forward  contracts  to  manage  currency  risk  associated  with  certain  transactions,  specifically  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  made  in  foreign
currencies.  Our  foreign  currency  contracts  hedge  forecasted  transactions  through  2025.  We  use  commodity  derivatives,  such  as  fixed-price
purchase commitments and swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts
hedge forecasted transactions through 2029.

We continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flow hedges, including reductions in our forecasted purchases of certain
commodities. As of December 31, 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flow hedges was not significant.

Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment

We  have  entered  into  agreements  to  purchase  and  sell  aluminum  to  address  long-term  strategic  sourcing  objectives  and  non-U.S.  business
requirements.  These agreements  are derivative  instruments  for  accounting purposes.  The quantities  of aluminum  in these  agreements  offset  and
are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps which do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment.

Notional Amounts and Fair Values

The  notional  amounts  and  fair  values  of  derivative  instruments  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Position  as  of  December  31  were  as

Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify gains of $2 (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings
during the next 12 months.

We  have derivative  instruments  with  credit-risk-related  contingent features.  For  foreign  exchange contracts  with  original maturities  of  at  least  five
years,  our  derivative  counterparties  could  require  settlement  if  we  default  on  our  five-year  credit  facility.  For  certain  commodity  contracts,  our
counterparties  could  require  collateral  posted  in  an  amount  determined  by  our  credit  ratings.  The  fair  value  of  foreign  exchange  and  commodity
contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at December 31, 2020 was $3. At December 31, 2020,
there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.

Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and
Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Money  market  funds,  available-for-sale  debt  investments  and  equity  securities  are  valued  using  a  market  approach  based  on  the  quoted  market
prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.

Derivatives include foreign currency and commodity contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based
on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income
approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.

Certain  assets  have  been  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  using  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3).  The  following  table
presents  the  nonrecurring  losses  recognized  for  the  years  ended  December  31  due  to  long-lived  asset  impairment,  and  the  fair  value  and  asset
classification of the related assets as of the impairment date:

Investments, Property, plant and equipment, Other assets and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on
the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. The fair value of the impaired customer financing assets includes operating lease
equipment and investments in sales type-leases/finance leases, and is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of
third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades
and  other  market  factors.  Management  reviews  the  publications  quarterly  to  assess  the  continued  appropriateness  and  consistency  with  market
trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the
features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net
sales price for the aircraft.

For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2020, the following table presents
the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.

The range represents  the sum of the highest and lowest values for all aircraft  subject to fair value measurement,  according to the third party
aircraft valuation publications that we use in our valuation process.
The negative amount represents the sum, for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration
of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments.

Fair Value Disclosures

The  fair  values  and  related  carrying  values  of  financial  instruments  that  are  not  required  to  be  remeasured  at  fair  value  on  the  Consolidated

The fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms
to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current
market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing
cost  derived  from  dealer  quotes  or  discounted  cash  flows.  The  fair  values  of  our  debt  classified  as  Level  3  are  based  on  discounted  cash  flow
models using the implied yield from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to
estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  indemnifications  and  financing  commitments  because  the  amount  and  timing  of  those  arrangements  are  uncertain.
Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds,
Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of assets
and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).

Note 21 – Legal Proceedings

Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.

In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  various  U.S.  government  inquiries  and  investigations  from  which  civil,  criminal  or  administrative  proceedings  could
result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble
damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also
be  suspended  or  debarred  from  government  contracts,  or  lose  its  export  privileges,  based  on  the  results  of  investigations.  Except  as  described
below, we believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation
will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses
in  excess  of  recorded  amounts  in  connection  with  any  of  the  matters  set  forth  below,  we  will  disclose  either  the  amount  or  range  of  reasonably
possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can
be made.

Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident
of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries
relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the outcome of which may be
material. Other than with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of
loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the pending lawsuits, investigations, and inquiries related
to the 737 MAX.

124

Table of Contents

On  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that  resolves  the  Department  of
Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under
the  terms  of  the  Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement,  we  agreed  to  the  filing  of  a  criminal  information  charging  the  Company  with  one  count  of
conspiracy  to  defraud  the  United  States,  based  on  the  conduct  of  two  former  737  MAX  program  technical  pilots;  the  criminal  information  will  be
dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that
we make payments totaling $2.51 billion, which consist of (a) a $243.6 million criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 million in additional compensation
to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1.77 billion to the
Company’s  airline  customers  for  harm  incurred  as  a  result  of  the  grounding  of  the  737  MAX,  offset  in  part  by  payments  already  made  and  the
remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that
we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting
and internal controls mechanisms. Of the payments described above, $1.77 billion has been included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737
MAX  customer  considerations.  We  incurred  earnings  charges  equal  to  the  remaining  $743.6  million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  related  to  this
agreement.

During 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and services
operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and
develop  new  markets  for  the  C-390  Millennium.  In  2020,  we  exercised  our  contractual  right  to  terminate  these  agreements  based  on  Embraer’s
failure  to  meet  certain  required  closing  conditions.  Embraer  has  disputed  our  right  to  terminate  the  agreements,  and  the  dispute  is  currently  in
arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.

Note 22 – Segment and Revenue Information

Effective  at  the  beginning  of  2020,  certain  programs  were  realigned  between  our  BDS  segment  and  Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other.
Business segment data for 2019 and 2018 has been adjusted to reflect the realignment.

Our  primary  profitability  measurements  to  review  a  segment’s  operating  results  are  Earnings/(loss)  from  operations  and  operating  margins.  We
operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS, and BCC. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page
67 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.

BCA  develops,  produces  and  markets  commercial  jet  aircraft  principally  to  the  commercial  airline  industry  worldwide.  Revenue  on  commercial
aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.

BDS  engages  in  the  research,  development,  production  and  modification  of  the  following  products  and  related  services:  manned  and  unmanned
military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems,  surveillance  and  engagement,  strategic  defense  and  intelligence  systems,  satellite  systems  and  space
exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

BGS  provides  parts,  maintenance,  modifications,  logistics  support,  training,  data  analytics  and  information-based  services  to  commercial  and
government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue on
commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is
generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.

Revenues  from  the  U.S.  government  (including  foreign  military  sales  through  the  U.S.  government),  primarily  recorded  at  BDS  and  BGS,
represented  51%,  39%,  and  31%  of  consolidated  revenues  for  2020,  2019,  and  2018,  respectively.  Approximately  4%  of  operating  assets  were
located outside the United States as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as geographic
location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Earnings in Equity Method Investments

We recorded Earnings from operations associated with our equity method investments of $86, $90 and $167, primarily in our BDS segment, for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Backlog

Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed.
Backlog  is  converted  into  revenue  in  future  periods  as  work  is  performed,  primarily  based  on  the  cost  incurred  or  at  delivery  and  acceptance  of
products, depending on the applicable accounting method.

Our backlog at December 31, 2020 was $363,404. We expect approximately 20% to be converted to revenue through 2021 and approximately 66%
through 2024, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue due to
the 737 MAX grounding in non-U.S. jurisdictions, entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10, and COVID-19 impacts.

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other

Unallocated  items,  eliminations  and  other  include  common  internal  services  that  support  Boeing’s  global  business  operations,  intercompany
guarantees provided to BCC and eliminations of certain sales between segments. Such sales include airplanes accounted for as operating leases
and  considered  transferred  to  the  BCC  segment.  We  generally  allocate  costs  to  business  segments  based  on  the  U.S.  federal  cost  accounting
standards. Components of Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table.

Pension costs, comprising GAAP service and prior service costs, are allocated to BCA and the commercial operations at BGS. Pension costs are
allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ
different  actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts.  Other postretirement
benefit  costs  are  allocated  to  business  segments  based  on  CAS,  which  is  generally  based  on  benefits  paid.  FAS/CAS  service  cost  adjustment
represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and
costs  allocated  to  the  business  segments.  Non-operating  pension  and  postretirement  expenses  represent  the  components  of  net  periodic  benefit
costs other than service cost. These expenses are included in Other income, net.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results
of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  December  31,  2020,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  —  Integrated
Framework (2013) issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  February  1,  2021,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's
financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  PCAOB  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion  on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate
opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As  more  fully  described  in  Notes  1  and  13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  over  time  for  long-term
contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue
is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves
estimating  the costs  to complete  production  of goods or rendering of services  and comparing  those costs  to the estimated  final revenue  amount.
Fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts
are  subject  to  significant  variability.  Due  to  the  technical  performance  requirements  in  many  of  these  contracts,  changes  to  cost  estimates  could
occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses.

Given the complexity of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United
States Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments
necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and
required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our auditing procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential
Aircraft fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.

• We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key estimates, including

the range and probability of possible outcomes.

• We performed  inquiries of the Company’s project managers and others directly  involved with the contracts  to evaluate project status  and
project challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete. We also observed the project work site when key estimates related to
tangible or physical progress of the project.

• We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used in developing key estimates. We developed independent expectations of likely

outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates.

• We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  review  of  judgments  made  and  significant  assumptions  used  to  develop  key  estimates,

including controls over the data used in developing the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.

• We performed retrospective reviews, comparing actual performance to estimated performance and the related financial statement impact,

when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’s estimation process and effectiveness of related internal controls.

Program Accounting Estimates for the 777X Program – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification and production schedules. The
Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accounting
requires  estimating  and  demonstrating  customer  demand  for  the  number  of  units  included  in  the  program  (program  accounting  quantity)  and
estimating the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the initial program accounting quantity and revenue
for unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of possible outcomes. Additionally,
the level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, resulting in delays in the timing of entry
into  service  and  corresponding  increases  in  estimated  costs.  Changes  to  the  program  accounting  quantity  or  revenue  and  cost  estimates  could
occur,  resulting  in  lower  margins  or  material  reach-forward  losses.  Auditing  the  estimated  revenues  and  costs  for  the  777X  program  involved
extensive audit effort and required professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to
management’s estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our auditing procedures over the estimated revenues and costs for the 777X program accounting quantity included the following, among others:

• We inquired of the Company’s management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the status of current sales

campaigns, short and long-term market demand, and status of negotiations with individual sold firm customers.

• We compared management’s estimate of market demand to external industry sources of expected demand.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions used in developing its estimates

related to the initial program accounting quantity and revenue for unsold units.

• We  evaluated  management’s  ability  to  estimate  program  revenue  by  comparison  to  historical  estimates  and  actual  results  on  similar

programs.

• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates.

•

Performed inquiries of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which may affect
total estimated costs to certify the aircraft.

• We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical extrapolation of

such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of possible outcomes relating to the specific estimates.

Liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding – Refer to Notes 13 and 21 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

In  2019,  following  two  fatal  737  MAX  accidents,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities  issued  orders
suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft (the “737 MAX Grounding”). Deliveries resumed in the U.S. in late 2020 following rescission
by the FAA of its grounding order. The 737 MAX remains grounded in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, multiple legal actions have been
filed against the Company following the fatal accidents and various governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries continue relating to the
accidents and the 737 MAX aircraft.

During 2019, the Company recorded an initial liability in connection with estimated payments, concessions and other in-kind consideration it intends
to  provide  to  customers  for  disruptions  related  to  the  737  MAX  Grounding  and  associated  delivery  delays.  This  liability  totaled  $5.5  billion  at
December  31,  2020  and  is  reflected  in  the  financial  statements  in  Accrued  liabilities.  This  represents  the  Company’s  best  estimate  of  future
concessions and other consideration to its customers, and is necessarily based on individual negotiations with customers and the substance of such
negotiations.

Significant judgment is involved in management’s ability to assess and reasonably estimate potential additional financial statement effects or a range
of  loss,  if  any,  resulting  from  the  outcome  of  737  MAX-related  litigation  and  the  results  of  the  various  ongoing  governmental  and  regulatory
investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.

The subjectivity  of  the liability  associated  with  providing  consideration  to  customers  resulting  from  the 737 MAX Grounding  and the complexity  of
assessing the outcome of the ongoing litigation and investigations related to the 737 MAX required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased
audit effort.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our auditing procedures associated with liabilities related to the 737 MAX Grounding included the following, among others:

• We inquired of management to understand developments with the 737 MAX Grounding, including the status of regulatory approval for return

to service in various foreign jurisdictions and the status of consideration negotiations with individual customers.

• We  obtained  written  representations  from  management  concerning  its  intent  to  provide  consideration  to  customers  and the  extent  of  that

consideration.

• We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  related  to  nonrecurring  items  and  loss  contingencies  associated  with  litigation,  claims  and

assessments.

• We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management to estimate the liability for customer consideration, including the timing and
conditions of 737 MAX return to service in various foreign jurisdictions, and, where possible, we corroborated the significant assumptions
with management outside of the accounting and finance organizations.

• We reviewed the terms of customer contracts and correspondence with customers concerning potential consideration as a result of the 737

MAX Grounding.

135

Table of Contents

• We evaluated the terms of settlement agreements with customers for the allocation of value provided between consideration as a result of

the 737 MAX Grounding and for consideration related to the impact of current economic conditions resulting from COVID-19.

• We evaluated delivery documents for 737 MAX deliveries for incremental value provided at delivery as potential consideration as a result of

the 737 MAX Grounding.

• We inquired of internal and external legal counsel to understand developments related to contractual obligations to customers, litigation and

other claims relating to the 737 MAX Grounding and progression in potential settlement discussions.

• We read minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees for evidence of unrecorded loss contingencies.

• We evaluated the Company’s disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of matters related to the 737 MAX Grounding.

Income Taxes – Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets– Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes deferred income taxes for differences
between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amount  and  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities,  measured  using  enacted  statutory  rates  in  effect  for  the
years  in  which  the  basis  differences  are  expected  to  reverse.  A  valuation  allowance  is  provided  to  offset  deferred  tax  assets  if,  based  upon  the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets
depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income typically include future reversals of
deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income exclusive of reversals of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. During 2020 the Company
determined that it is not more likely than not that sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character will be generated in the future to realize all of
its deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded.

We identified the Company’s determination that it is not more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize all
of its deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and estimates made related to the timing of future reversals
of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve
our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s methodologies and estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our auditing procedures related to the timing of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities included the following, among others:

• With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods, significant assumptions, and judgments
used by management to determine whether it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets.

• We tested the Company’s methodologies for scheduling the reversal of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences.

136

Table of Contents

• We  evaluated  whether  the  estimates  considered  when  determining  future  taxable  income  were  consistent  with  the  evidence  obtained  in

other areas of the audit.

• We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  including  management’s  controls  over  determining  the

pattern of the reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020,
based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  — Integrated  Framework  (2013 )  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the
Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  (PCAOB),  the
consolidated  financial  statements  as  of  and  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  of  the  Company,  and  our  report  dated  February  1,  2021
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the
effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all material  respects.  Our  audit  included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A
company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the
company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020 and have
concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on  the  framework  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation  under  the  framework  in  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework,  our  management  concluded  that  our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
