PART I

Item 1.  Business.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc.
and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference
of the information contained on the websites.

Description of Business

We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology. We do that
by leveraging our combination of tech and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit
our stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Segments and Geographic Areas

We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states,
districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy
Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and
greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best
Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.

On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), a health services company, and
on August 7, 2019, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”). Additional
information on these acquisitions is included in Note 2, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Operations

Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments
operate a multi-channel platform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.

Domestic Segment

Development of merchandise and service offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile
application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support
capabilities (for example, human resources, finance and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate
headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in-home teams from our corporate headquarters and
regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer
relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All
stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market
characteristics.

International Segment

Our Canada and Mexico operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment.

Merchandise and Services

Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories. The key components of each revenue category are
as follows:

•  Computing and Mobile Phones - computing and peripherals, e-readers, mobile phones (including related mobile network

carrier commissions), networking, tablets and wearables (including smartwatches);

•  Consumer Electronics - digital imaging, health and fitness, home theater, portable audio (including headphones and portable

speakers) and smart home;

•  Appliances - large appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including

blenders, coffee makers and vacuums);

•  Entertainment - drones, gaming hardware and software, peripherals, movies, music, toys, virtual reality and other software;
•  Services - consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support and

health-related services; and

•  Other - beverages, snacks, sundry items and other product offerings within our International segment (including baby, luggage

and sporting goods).

Distribution

Domestic Segment

Customers who purchase products online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curbside pick-up in select
stores), at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve
product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution
centers located throughout the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our
stores from suppliers.

International Segment

Our Canada and Mexico distribution models are similar to that of our Domestic segment.

Suppliers and Inventory

Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers
accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and
LG – representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our
vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.

We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as
possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected
consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to
reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain
products.

We also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brand products.

Store Development

We had 1,175 large-format and 56 small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2020 throughout our Domestic and International segments.
Our stores are a vital component of our multi-channel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also
have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. We
continuously look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our
operations.

Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our
Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.

Intellectual Property

We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not
limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, Best Buy Mobile, CST, Dynex, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Insignia, Jitterbug,
Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Pacific Sales, Platinum, Rocketfish, 5Star and our Yellow Tag logo.

We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured
patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing
of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.

Seasonality

Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth
quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from
operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes
and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping
season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.

Competition

Our competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based
retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help
customers online, in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs provides us key
competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on

price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our
ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain
retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the
economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, our
integrated online, retail and in-home assets, our broad and curated product assortment, our strong vendor partnerships, our service and
support offerings designed to solve real customer needs, our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our
supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.

Environmental and Social Matters

Best Buy is an organization built on values-driven leadership and a clear purpose to enrich lives through technology. We strive to be a
good corporate citizen in all our interactions with stakeholders, including customers, employees, vendor partners, shareholders, the
environment and communities in which we operate.

For our business to succeed, we need to hire and retain the best employees. To accomplish this, we must maintain a supportive and
inclusive culture that values everyone’s talents, life experiences and backgrounds and offer compensation and benefits that maintain
our competitiveness and reflect our values. We recently added two new benefit offerings: surrogacy assistance and increased adoption
expense reimbursement. They were the latest in a suite of expanded benefits, based on employee feedback, that included paid
caregiver leave, paid time off for part-time employees and expanded mental health resources.

Best Buy has also continued to publicly show commitment to equality and non-discrimination. We joined the Human Rights Campaign
and 160 leading U.S. companies to support the Equality Act, federal legislation that would add protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people to U.S. civil rights laws. We also signed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court to show
support for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.

We are committed to supporting teens from underserved communities as they build brighter futures through technology, training and
mentorship. The primary way we do this is through our network of Best Buy Teen Tech Centers. The centers are safe, after-school
learning spaces equipped with cutting-edge technology where youth learn new tech skills, stay on track with school, gain exposure to
new career possibilities and benefit from positive adult and peer relationships. We had 33 Teen Tech Centers operating at the end of
fiscal 2020 and plan to have at least 60 operating over the next few years.

Minimizing carbon emissions in our operations is a priority at Best Buy. We have achieved significant progress toward our carbon-
reduction goal of 75 percent by 2030 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. In fiscal 2020,
we made an investment in partnership with U.S. Bank and X-Elio to build a solar field that is expected to produce 174,000 MWh of
clean electricity per year.

We also set a new goal to help our customers cut carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2030 through purchasing ENERGY STAR®
certified products, which will save them $5 billion on utility bills. In addition, we collected more than 204 million pounds of consumer
electronics and appliances for recycling last year, bringing our total to more than 2.1 billion pounds. We continue to earn recognition
from prestigious organizations, including being named to CDP’s Climate A List and ranking among Barron’s Most Sustainable
Companies.

Please refer to the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability section on our website for further information on environmental and
social performance.

Number of Employees

At the end of fiscal 2020, we employed nearly 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and
statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the following risk
factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our
other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the
market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical
results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are
not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial.
All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.

We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional
store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.

While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most
customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of
consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with
many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and
mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the
markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.

The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some
online-only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with
customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on
delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive
delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based
on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might
be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these
and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.

Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.

As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer
markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new
and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions,
failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we may be
subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to
increased potential liability risk.

This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees,
operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In
addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our
growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current
expertise.

In fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. The new
health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. In addition, the
services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system
interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our
revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.

We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation,
memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing,
marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:

increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;

•
•   pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;
•
increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;
•   unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;
•   employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes,

which may increase our scope of liability;
the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;

•
•   employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our

•

responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold;
the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for
the actions they undertake;

7

Table of Contents

•

•

the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and
catastrophic events; and
increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.

We are subject to risks associated with company transformation.

Our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income
growth, including our Building the New Blue strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material
impact on achieving that strategy.

Any limitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives
supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and
providing differentiated value. If we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources
to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected.

Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our
revenue and profitability.

We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers
accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and
LG - representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our
vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms
with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional
programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-
focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer
capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive
advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or
their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified
by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our
ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion
of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer
certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.

We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The
competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing
consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification
requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers
may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own
stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.

If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations
and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.

Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service
centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers
requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to
recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee
engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to
offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our
efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive
team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact
our operations.

We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits
could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on
employer-provided benefits, and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and
benefit packages could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.

We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material
adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:

•
•

•

the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;
the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international
agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;
the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the
products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;

8

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the California
Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA");
the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor
Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment
rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or
payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well
as alter our expense structure;
the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and
employment matters; and
the impact of the general election on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies.

With respect to the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, the statute provides new privacy rights for California residents
and requires companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal
information. In addition, the California Attorney General has issued proposed rules under the CCPA. We cannot predict the impact of
this first-of-its-kind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized, in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in
other states and the U.S. federal level, on our business or operations, but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data
processing practices and policies, interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an effort to
comply.

The impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade
agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect
on our business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of
tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we
did in fiscal 2020.

Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws,
including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs
associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert
management's attention and resources from other matters.

Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of novel coronavirus
disease (“COVID 19”) may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.

To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending.
As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:

their choice of brand, model or price-point;

•   whether or not they make a purchase;
•
•   how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and
•

their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).

Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor, inflation, employment levels, oil
prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the
products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the
macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

The impact of COVID-19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results.

Concerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming
ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or
self-quarantine have increased, which will adversely affect traffic to our stores. In particular, we recently announced a shift to enhanced
curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis. Further, all in-home installation and repair has been temporarily
suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. The significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at,
our stores caused by COVID-19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. We may further restrict
the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authorities and
these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic,
or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage
to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future.

COVID-19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our
products are manufactured. We could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the U.S. as well as significant deterioration
in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.

In addition, we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incurred to

9

Table of Contents

implement the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working
during the pandemic.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the
duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and
spending, all of which are highly uncertain.

Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining
revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may
be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or
our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative.
Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our
growth or other critical initiatives.

We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these
systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.

The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information
technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including
demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and
deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.

Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches
(through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and
usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could
significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.

Our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID-19, including for example, a
significant increase in remote working of our employees and an increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations.

We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these
systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and
improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such
as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as
natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer
orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our
reputation.

Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company
information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.

Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as
confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential
information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a
variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches
of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks,
lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our
privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate
employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate
manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately
detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer
information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our
customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and
claims.

Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on
products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts
to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service
may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.

Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs
of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations
to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the CCPA, are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of
customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise
of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal
risk.

Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.

We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, "new ventures").
Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be
adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:

failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;

•   different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;
•
•   uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;
•

failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or
information technology systems;
failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;
•
•
failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;
•   unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;
•   disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and
•   adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.

If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to
recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and
management's attention from other important areas of our business.

We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the
majority of the holiday shopping season.

A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday
shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable
factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it
difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters,
changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management
information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our
operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.

Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and
changes in consumer preferences.

We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This
manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of
categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.

This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail
to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the
products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to
secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising,
marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. These and
other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.

Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to
our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs.

We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers.
Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying
purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other
available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2020
revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses
from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to
numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest
rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors
could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from
sharing in the profits of the programs.

Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely
affect our business.

Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the
emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location,
right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network.
The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:

11

Table of Contents

interruptions to our delivery capabilities;
failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;

•
•
•   disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;
•
•
•
•   diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns, which have resulted in and could
continue to result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods
produced in infected areas;

limitations in capacity;
consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;
labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;

•   damages or other loss to products; and
•

increasing transportation costs.

It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands.
Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our
dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the
scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these
risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and
profitability.

Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.

The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such
events may be caused by, for example:

•   natural disasters or extreme weather events;
•   diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or

partners;
floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or
terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.

•
•

In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. Such events can
adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or
disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in
disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of
these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which
could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.

Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition
through a focused consumer experience approach.

We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation
of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services,
uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such
as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and
other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated.
Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty,
decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which
could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.

Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.

If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be
exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls
could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls
of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement
products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.

Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of
our operating model.

As an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws
and regulations including, for example:

•

•
•

the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor
Relations Board continually considers;
laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and
laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our
payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.

12

Table of Contents

Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our
profitability.

Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.

Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations
for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased,
of which some are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence
the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:

changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;
the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;
the interior layout, format and size of our stores;
the products and services we offer at each store;
the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;
the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store;
the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•   our supply chain service location network strategy.

If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could
include, for example:

closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;
incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;

•
•
•   operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and
•   bearing excessive lease expenses.

These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.

For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the
lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the
availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can
be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant
properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease
property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default
by the sub-lease tenant.

Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.

We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance
business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue
business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid
investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our
vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may
need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market
conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our
reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing, our ability to pursue
business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.

Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.

Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to
capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or
obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies
at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the
introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.

We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their
services might have an impact to our business.

We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information
technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and
customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance
programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems
provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption
occurs during peak revenue periods.

Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our
operating results.

Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as
other products such as Jitterbug, Lively Mobile and Lively Mobile Plus, represent an important component of our product offerings and
our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This
arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:

•   we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive

brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign
jurisdictions;

•   we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property

damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product
recalls;

•   we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and
we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns,
our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural
disasters;

•   we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for

migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;

•   we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights;
•   we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign

countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;

•   we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents

or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;

•   our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of
trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product
supply;

•   we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand

•

products or manufacturing processes; and
regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply
chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an
adverse effect on our reputation.

Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer
loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on
the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.

We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.

Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality
and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability,
cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics
(including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in
design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change
their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the
legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we
operate.

We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract
manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including
Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2020, our International
segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International
operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:

•   political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;
•   economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;
•

rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign
entities;

•   government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and

differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;
cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;

•
•   different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;
•   difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and
•   difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.

14

Table of Contents

These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability
and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.

Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could
result in a decline in our stock price.

We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we
believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and
is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and
uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with
guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels
and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to
adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our
percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the
products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our
financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance
for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted new lease accounting guidance that resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on
the balance sheet. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding this adoption.

(2)  Fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks. All other periods presented included 52 weeks.
(3)  Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months, as well as revenue related to certain

other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized
stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the
comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refined
our methodology for calculating comparable sales. It now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation, such as credit
card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. The impact of adopting these changes is
immaterial to all periods presented, and therefore prior-period comparable sales disclosures have not been restated. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding our comparable sales calculation.

(4)  The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities.
(5)

Includes Best Buy Outlet Centers for all fiscal years presented.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of
our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly
impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is presented in the
following sections:

•   Overview
•   Business Strategy
•   Results of Operations
•   Liquidity and Capital Resources
•   Critical Accounting Estimates
•   New Accounting Pronouncements

Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In March 2019, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10618, FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of
Regulation S-K (“FAST Act”). The amendment aims to modernize and simplify certain reporting requirements and improve readability
and navigability between disclosures. On adoption of this amendment, we omitted analysis of the results of operations and cash flows
for the year ended February 2, 2019, in comparison to the year ended February 3, 2018. For such omitted disclosures, refer to Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, which Item 7 is incorporated by reference herein.

Overview

Our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International.
The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names
including Best Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific
Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in
Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain names
bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018
included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A
large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday
shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refined our methodology for calculating
comparable sales. It now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation, such as credit
card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. The impact of
adopting these changes is immaterial to all periods presented, and therefore prior-period comparable sales disclosures have not been
restated. Our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full
months, as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the
prior year. Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the
comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation
beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The calculation of comparable sales
excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
(applicable to our International segment only). The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result,
our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods.

On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a
result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On
October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”) and on May 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding
shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”). Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are included in
our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of CST are excluded from our
comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("GAAP"), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-
GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations. We believe that non-GAAP
financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in
evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For these reasons, our internal management reporting also
includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as
restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, gains and losses on investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related
costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when we
believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered
in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders
to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP
financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

In our discussions of the operating results of our Consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are
references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating
results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term "constant currency," which represents
results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results
translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We

23

Table of Contents

believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of
significant fluctuations in currency rates.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted non-GAAP operating
income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the presented periods.

Business Strategy

In fiscal 2020, we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 2.1% on top of 4.8% in fiscal 2019, which represents our sixth consecutive
year of positive Enterprise comparable sales. We also increased GAAP diluted EPS by 10.6% to $5.75 and increased our non-GAAP
diluted EPS by 14.1% to $6.07. In addition, we recorded annual revenue of $43.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $2.0 billion and
non-GAAP operating income of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2020. Compared to fiscal 2019, our fiscal 2020 GAAP and non-GAAP operating
income as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 20 basis points and approximately 30 basis points, respectively. From a
capital allocation standpoint, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

We continue to make progress on our Building the New Blue strategy and our purpose to enrich lives through technology. Our strategy
is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet every day human needs and build more and deeper relationships with
customers. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers,
capturing new demand, entering new spaces and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time.

During fiscal 2020 we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, ending fiscal 2020 with almost 2.3 million members.
Having a service that provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they bought it,
is a compelling value proposition for our members. We also expanded our In-Home Advisor program from 530 advisors to
approximately 720 advisors and provided more than 250,000 free, in-home consultations to customers across the nation. In Health, we
continued to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. We successfully
integrated acquisitions that have given us the capabilities, infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We
continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment, enabled by the advancement of our supply chain
transformation. In parallel to the customer experience work, we continued to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund
investments and offset pressures.

In addition to these accomplishments, we are proud of our progress in advancing our Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability
efforts. In fact, we were named to the top 5 on Barron’s annual “100 Most Sustainable Companies” list for the third consecutive year.

In September 2019, we set three fiscal 2025 targets focused on employees, customers and financials, which are:

•

•

•

to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune’s “100 Best Companies” to
work for list;
to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million, which includes Total Tech Support
memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, customers using our financial services offerings and senior lives
supported; and
to deliver continued top- and bottom-line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5.0% non-GAAP
operating income rate in fiscal 2025.

Looking to the future, our priorities will look to build upon our momentum and remain focused on achieving our fiscal 2025 targets. We
will continue to bring our deep consumer electronics expertise and ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new
technology, offering customers great products and solutions. Our priorities will also include increasing our Total Tech Support member
base, growing our Health business and continuing to expand our In-Home Advisor program. We will also continue to innovate and
design multi-channel experiences that solve customer needs across our website, app and other channels in ways that enhance the
experience across online and physical shopping and continue with our supply chain transformation, including using automation and
process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation. In addition, as has
been our brand over the last several years, we will strive to keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business.

Impact of COVID-19

We are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business and in all of our locations. We are making the best
decisions we can with two goals in mind: protecting employees, customers and their respective families, while trying our best to serve
our customers who rely on us for increasingly vital technology. We have seen increased demand for products that people need to work
or learn from home, as well as those products that allow people to refrigerate or freeze food. As we meet the demand for these
necessities, we are adjusting how we operate in many ways to improve safety. For example, except where otherwise directed by state
and local authorities, on March 22, 2020, we shifted to enhanced curbside service only for all of our U.S. stores on an interim basis.
Customers can also still order online or via the Best Buy app and have their products shipped directly to their homes. Large products,
such as appliances, will be delivered where permitted and under strict safety guidelines with doorstep drop-off deliveries only. All in-
home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. We may
further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities and these measures could have a material impact on our revenues
and profits. COVID-19 could also lead to significant disruption to our supply chain for products we sell and could trigger a significant
deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending.

24

All Best Buy employees have been told they do not have to work if they do not feel comfortable and to stay home if they are feeling
sick, knowing they will be paid. All field employees whose hours have been eliminated will be paid for two weeks at their normal wage
rate based on their average hours worked over the last 10 weeks.

It is not possible to predict the likelihood, timing or severity of the aforementioned direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on our
business. In light of the uncertainty in this fluid environment, on March 19, 2020, we drew the full amount of our $1.25 billion revolving
credit facility and temporarily suspended all share repurchases.

Tariffs

During fiscal 2020, we worked to actively address the risks related to increases to tariff rates and proposed new tariffs on Chinese
imports. In May 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) increased the tariff on List 3 products imported from China from 10% to
25%, effective June 15, 2019. The USTR also implemented a List 4 tariff of 15% on additional products imported from China. The List 4
tariffs had two effective dates. The first effective date (List 4A) was September 1, 2019, and the most notable affected categories
relative to Best Buy on this list are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date (List 4B) was December 15,
2019, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy on this list are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. On
January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China completed a “phase one” trade agreement. Under the agreement, List 4A tariffs were reduced
from 15% to 7.5%, effective 30 days later. List 4B tariffs were suspended indefinitely and List 1-3 tariffs of 25% were maintained. There
was no timeline given for additional phases (or tariff actions) to begin or to be concluded. Throughout fiscal 2020, we were able to
minimize the impact of tariffs on our business by accelerating purchases and working with our vendors, some of which are in the
process of migrating their manufacturing out of China, factoring tariffs into our product assortment decisions, promotional and pricing
strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies in partnership with our vendors. However, future trade disputes with China or future
phases of trade negotiations between the U.S. and China could lead to the imposition of new tariffs or other adverse consequences for
our business.

Results of Operations

In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our
Mexico operations on a one-month lag. Consistent with such consolidation, the financial and non-financial information presented in our
MD&A relative to these operations is also presented on a lag. Our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag
period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. No such events were identified for the periods presented.

(1)  Comparable sales exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile
stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On
October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall and on May 9, 2019, we acquired all outstanding shares of CST. Consistent with our comparable sales
policy, the results of GreatCall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of CST are excluded from
our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.

(2)  Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be

comparable to other retailers' corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Includes both gain from discontinued operations and net earnings from discontinued operations.

Revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A rate and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by our Domestic

(1)  Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1,

2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and the results of CST are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented.

The increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the comparable sales growth of 2.3% and revenue from GreatCall prior
to its inclusion in comparable sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These increases were partially offset by the loss of revenue from
store closures. Online revenue increased in fiscal 2020 due to higher average order values, higher conversion rates and increased
traffic.

Our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by lower product margin rates, partially offset by the higher gross profit
rate of GreatCall.

Our SG&A rate decreased in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by expenses associated with
GreatCall, which we acquired in October 2018.

Restructuring charges in fiscal 2020 related to our U.S. retail operating model changes. Refer to Note 9, Restructuring, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for further information about our restructuring activities.

Our operating income rate increased in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the decrease in SG&A rate, partially offset by the decrease in
gross profit rate described above.

•   Services: The 9.3% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by warranty revenue.
•   Other: The 14.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by luggage and baby products.

Our gross profit rate increased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased revenue in the higher margin services category, primarily
related to our Canadian operations.

Our SG&A rate increased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to sales de-leverage, as SG&A dollars decreased due to the favorable impact of
foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to Canada.

Our operating income rate remained flat in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the increase in gross profit rate, partially offset by the
increase in SG&A rate described above.

Additional Consolidated Results

Other Income (Expense)

Our gain on sale of investments decreased in fiscal 2020, due to the sale of fewer equity investments.

Our investment income and other remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020.

Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the derecognition of financing obligations as a result of our adoption of new
lease accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 10, Leases, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in pre-tax earnings. Our effective tax rate remained
relatively unchanged in fiscal 2020.

(1)  Represents charges associated with acquisitions, including (1) the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships,

tradenames and developed technology, and (2) acquisition-related transaction costs primarily comprised of professional fees. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 3,
Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the nature of these charges.

U.S. in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 9, Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the nature of these charges.

(3)  Represents charges and subsequent adjustments resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“tax reform”) enacted into law in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018,

including amounts associated with a deemed repatriation tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as tax reform-related items announced in
response to future tax savings created by tax reform, including a one-time bonus for certain employees and a one-time contribution to the Best Buy Foundation. Refer to
Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding the nature of these charges.

(4)  Represents (gain) loss on sale of investments and investment impairments included in Investment income and other on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
(5)  Represents the summation of the calculated income tax charge related to each non-GAAP non-income tax adjustment. The non-GAAP adjustments relate primarily to

adjustments in the U.S. and Canada. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rates for the U.S. (ranging from 24.5% to 36.7% for the periods
presented) and Canada (ranging from 26.6% to 26.9% for the periods presented), applied to the non-GAAP adjustments of each country.

Our non-GAAP operating income increased $137 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by strong revenue performance in our Domestic
segment in nearly all product categories and a decrease in SG&A, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. The increase in non-
GAAP operating income resulted in a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020, which also
benefited from a lower weighted-average diluted share count from share repurchases. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate decreased in
fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the resolution of discrete tax matters.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Summary

We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of
investment required to support our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, credit facilities, short-
term borrowing arrangements and working capital management. Capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our

cash flow and capital management strategy which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our
business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our
strategy.

Cash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):

The increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by share
repurchases, investments in capital expenditures and dividends.

 (1,133)

The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital, primarily due to the
timing of receipts and payments on inventory, the timing of deliveries of inventory to customers, increased earnings and lower incentive
compensation payments due to a special one-time incentive payment in fiscal 2019. This was partially offset by the timing of collections
on receivables and the timing of tax payments.

Investing Activities

The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to decreases in sales and increases in purchases of
investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash used in the acquisitions of CST and BioSensics in fiscal 2020 compared to the
acquisition of GreatCall in fiscal 2019.

Financing Activities

The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020 and the
repayment in fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due August 1, 2018. This was partially offset by the issuance in
fiscal 2019 of our $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028.

Sources of Liquidity

Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our
most significant sources of liquidity. We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital
expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and strategic initiatives, including business combinations. However, in the event our
liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash
flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain
additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.

We have a $1.25 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Facility”) with a syndicate of banks that expires in April
2023. There were no borrowings under the Facility during fiscal 2020. On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility
to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19. Refer to Note
6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Our ability to continue to access the Facility is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions, including financial covenants.
The financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants. If an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt, it would likely constitute an event of default under
our Facility as well.

Our credit ratings and outlook at March 18, 2020, are summarized below. On October 30, 2019, Fitch affirmed its BBB rating and
withdrew all future ratings for commercial reasons. On March 9, 2020, Moody’s concluded their review for upgrade that was initiated on
November 20, 2019, and confirmed its current rating of Baa1 and changed its outlook to Stable from Rating Under Review. Standard &
Poor’s rating and outlook remained unchanged from the prior year.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject
to review at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic
environment, conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. If
further changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, interest costs for certain of our credit
facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing costs.

Restricted Cash

Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compensation
and general liability insurance claims. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets,
was $126 million and $204 million at February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively. The decrease was due to a dividend of
excess cash from our wholly-owned insurance captive that manages a portion of our self-insured claims.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores, distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements
(including e-commerce). Capital expenditures were as follows ($ in millions):

Non-cash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases, as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable.

Debt and Capital

As of February 1, 2020, we had $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”), and $500 million principal
amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”), outstanding. Refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
information.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

We repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors ("Board"). The payment
of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund
operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases
while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.

On February 23, 2019, our Board authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. As of February 1, 2020, $2.0 billion of the
$3.0 billion share repurchase authorization was available. Between the end of fiscal 2020 on February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020, we
repurchased an incremental 0.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $56 million. We have since temporarily suspended all
share repurchases.

Dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividends per share, partially
offset by fewer shares outstanding due to the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.

On February 27, 2020, our Board authorized a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share, effective immediately.

Other Financial Measures

Our current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, was 1.1 as of February 1, 2020, compared to 1.2 as
of February 2, 2019. Our debt to earnings ratio, calculated as total debt (including current portion) divided by net earnings from
continuing operations, was 0.8 as of February 1, 2020, compared to 0.9 as of February 2, 2019. The decline in both ratios was primarily
due to the adoption of new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that resulted in the recognition of operating
lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and
Note 10, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding this adoption.

Included in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at February 1, 2020, was a $22 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific
payment dates for deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances have not been reflected in the "Payments Due by Period" section of the table.

Additionally, we had $1.25 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at February 1, 2020. On March 19, 2020, we drew down the
full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of
COVID-19. The proceeds and resulting liability from the facility will be included in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term debt,
respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions,
estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated
financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could
differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other
than our adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or
methodologies during the past three fiscal years. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments
and generally incorporate significant uncertainty.

32

Table of Contents

Vendor Allowances

Description
We receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-
based or sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores. We recognize these funds as a reduction of
cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. If the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes, the funds are
recognized ratably over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed. Funds that are determined to be a
reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related
expense when incurred.

Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate
Due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be
recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory. These estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including
(1) proper classification of the type of funding received; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding
that should be recognized in cost of sales, which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of
inventory.

Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
A 10% change in our vendor funding deferral at February 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million in
fiscal 2020.

Goodwill

Description
Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit
with its carrying value. Fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an
arms-length transaction.

Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate
Determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market
information, such as trading multiples when applicable. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as revenue
growth rates, expenses and capital expenditures. Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. We
have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $443 million and $541 million,
respectively, as of February 1, 2020. There is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
the Best Buy Health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis. In
particular, our analysis of the Best Buy Health reporting unit fair value includes estimation of revenue growth rates, capital expenditure
requirements and weighted-average cost of capital rates that incorporate significant judgment.

Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
A 10% change in the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit at February 1, 2020, would not have a material effect on our net
earnings.

Inventory Markdown

Description
Our merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at February 1, 2020. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value
through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery
we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for
inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit.

Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate
Markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment
about the expected recovery rates. The determination of the expected recovery rates includes the evaluation of historical recovery rates
as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, the promotional environment,
vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other
components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.

Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
A 10% change in our markdown adjustment at February 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by approximately $11 million in
fiscal 2020.

Tax Contingencies

Description
Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities audit our tax
filing positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our

33

Table of Contents

various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for
which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and
income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the
relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also
affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.

Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply
judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and
uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal
factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending.

Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be
exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are
required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could
be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our
effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of
resolution.

Service Revenue

Description
We sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support, extended
warranty, price discounts on future purchases, anti-virus software and one-time service repairs. We allocate the transaction price to all
performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value. For technical support membership contracts, we
typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This
method involves the use of expected usage patterns, derived from historic information.

Judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate
There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) measuring the relative
standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to
customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and (3) assessing the pattern of
delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When insufficient history of
usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.

Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
A 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of February 1, 2020, would have affected net earnings by
approximately $12 million in fiscal 2020.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in short-term market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense. Our
cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates. In addition, we have
swapped our fixed-rate debt to floating-rate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with short-term interest rates. Refer to
Note 5, Derivative Instruments, and Note 6, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our interest rate swaps.

As of February 1, 2020, we had $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of debt that has been swapped to floating
rate, and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was $1.0 billion. As of February 1, 2020, a 50-basis point increase
in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $5 million reduction in net interest expense, and conversely a 50-basis point
decrease in short-term interest rates would have led to an estimated $5 million increase in net interest expense.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our International segment operations. On a
limited basis, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory
purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective in

34

Table of Contents

holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as net asset value associated with changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives
that are not designated as hedging instruments, which generally have terms of up to 12 months. Refer to Note 5, Derivative
Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these instruments.

Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar
compared to the prior-year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as our Canadian dollar revenue translated into
fewer U.S. dollars. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of
approximately $29 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2020.

Management's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
the related financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and necessarily
include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, which conducted its audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). The independent registered public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion as to whether such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in
accordance with GAAP.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that:

(1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the

dispositions of our assets;

(2)  provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

accordance with GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
management and Board; and

(3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our

assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, using the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
(2013). Based on our assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of February 1, 2020. During our assessment, we did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements for the year
ended February 1, 2020, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has
issued an unqualified attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Best Buy Co., Inc.
Richfield, Minnesota

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
changes in shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2020, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended February 1, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March 23, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the Company’s financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02
Leases (Topic 842) as of February 3, 2019. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.

Vendor Allowances — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company receives vendor allowances from certain merchandise vendors through a variety of programs intended to offset the
invoice cost of inventory and for promoting and selling merchandise inventory. Purchases-based vendor allowances are initially
deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated
inventory is sold. Sales-based vendor allowances are based on merchandise sold and are calculated using an agreed upon amount for
each unit sold and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. Other promotional allowances not
specifically related to volume of purchases or sales, such as advertising and in-store product placement are recognized ratably as a
reduction to cost of sales over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed. Funds that are determined
to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor’s products are recorded as an offset to
the related expense when incurred.

Given the significance of vendor allowances to the financial statements and volume and diversity of the individual vendor agreements,
auditing vendor allowances was complex and subjective due to the extent of effort required to evaluate whether the vendor allowances
were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and that the allowances deferred as an offset to inventory were
complete and accurate.

37

Table of Contents

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to evaluating whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor
agreements and the completeness and accuracy of deferred vendor allowances included the following, among others:

•  We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recording of vendor allowances, including management's controls over the
establishment of vendor arrangements, the calculation of vendor allowances earned, and the determination of the deferred
vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory.

•  We selected a sample of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and (1) recalculated the amount

recognized using the terms of the vendor agreement; (2) for certain arrangements, confirmed the terms of the agreement
directly with the vendor; and (3) evaluated, based on the terms of the agreement, if the amount should be deferred and
recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory.

•  Where confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to
underlying contractual arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of
Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.

•  We tested the amount of deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory by developing an expectation for
the amount based on the historical amounts recorded as a percentage of vendor allowances earned and comparing our
expectation to the amount recorded by management.

Goodwill — Best Buy Health Reporting Unit — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
value. The goodwill balance was $984 million as of February 1, 2020, of which $541 million was related to the Best Buy Health
reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, which
requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues. Changes in these
assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The fair
value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was
recognized.

Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, performing audit
procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future revenue of
the Best Buy Health reporting unit, specifically for new products and services, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an
increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue used by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health
reporting unit included the following, among others:

•  We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination
of the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue.
•  We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management’s historical

forecasts.

•  We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts for the new products and services by comparing the

forecasts to: (1) the Company’s historical revenue growth rates, including for similar existing products and services; (2) internal
communications to management and the board of directors; (3) underlying source documents, when available, such as customer
contracts; (4) underlying analyses detailing business strategies and growth plans; (5) forward-looking revenue expectations in
external communications made by management to analysts and investors; and (6) industry reports containing analyses of the
Company and its peers utilizing the assistance of our fair value specialists.

•  We inquired of operating and sales management teams to determine whether the judgments and assumptions used in the future

revenue projections were consistent with the strategy and long- range plans for the Best Buy Health reporting unit.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Best Buy Co., Inc.
Richfield, Minnesota

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020, of the Company and our report dated
March 23, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the
Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms "Best Buy," "we," "us" and "our" in these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements refers to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries.

Description of Business

Our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International.
The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names
including Best Buy, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Health, CST, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Lively, Magnolia and Pacific
Kitchen and Home and the domain names bestbuy.com and greatcall.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in
Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and the domain names
bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.

On October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”). On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the
outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), and on August 7, 2019, we acquired the predictive healthcare
technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”). Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, for additional information.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.

In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements, we consolidate the financial results of our
Mexico operations on a one-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate recording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that
significantly affect our consolidated financial statements. No significant intervening event occurred in these operations that would have
materially affected our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2020, fiscal
2019 or fiscal 2018.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 reflects the proceeds attributed to a non-compete clause from the sale of Best Buy Europe to
Carphone Warehouse plc.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") requires us to
make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial
statements, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially affected if actual results were to differ
from these estimates and assumptions.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks and fiscal 2018
included 53 weeks, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter.

Unadopted Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-04,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates the requirement to calculate
the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead,
entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the
charge based on the current Step 1). We do not believe the new guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement - Disclosure Framework (Topic 820). The updated
guidance improves the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. We do not believe the updated guidance, which is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This guidance requires
companies to apply the internal-use software guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40 to implementation costs
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to determine whether to capitalize certain implementation costs or expense
them as incurred. We do not believe the new guidance, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, will have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires the recognition of operating lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to
assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02 using the “Comparatives Under 840 Option” approach to transition. Under
this method, financial information related to periods prior to adoption were as originally reported under the previous standard – ASC
840, Leases. The effects of adopting the new standard (ASC 842, Leases) in fiscal 2020 were recognized as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal first quarter. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted
under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease
classification as operating or capital leases. We also elected to combine lease and non-lease components and to exclude short-term
leases from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in determining the lease term for
existing leases as of February 3, 2019.

The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of $2.7 billion and
$2.8 billion, respectively, while our accounting for existing capital leases (now referred to as finance leases) remained substantially
unchanged. The cumulative impact of these changes decreased retained earnings by $22 million, which included a $3 million net-of-tax
adjustment made during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 related to on-adoption impairment charges. We expect the impact of adoption
to be immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows on an ongoing basis. As part of
our adoption, we also modified our control procedures and processes, none of which materially affected our internal control over
financial reporting. See Note 10, Leases, for additional lease disclosures.

Segment Information

Our business is organized into two reportable segments: Domestic (which is comprised of all states, districts and territories of the U.S.)
and International (which is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico). Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is our
Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions, including determining resource allocation for,
and monitoring the performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Domestic reportable segment and the International reportable
segment.

Our CODM relies on internal management reporting that analyzes enterprise results to the net earnings level and reportable segment
results to the operating income level. We aggregate our Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health operating segments into one
Domestic reportable segment. We also aggregate our Canada and Mexico businesses into one International operating segment, which
represents the International reportable segment.

Business Combinations

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired
assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to business combinations are included
prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition and transaction costs related to business combinations are recorded within selling,
general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, commercial paper,
corporate bonds and time deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less when purchased. The amounts of cash equivalents
at February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, were $1,668 million and $1,410 million, respectively, and the weighted-average interest
rates were 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our Consolidated Balance Sheets is reconciled to the total shown within our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows ($ in millions):

Amounts included in restricted cash are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers' compensation and general liability
insurance claims.

Receivables

Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from vendors for various vendor funding programs, banks for customer credit card and
debit card transactions and mobile phone network operators for device sales and commissions. We establish allowances for
uncollectible receivables based primarily on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $24 million
and $23 million at February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019, respectively. We did not have material write-offs during the periods
presented.

Merchandise Inventories

Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted average method is used to determine
the cost of inventory which includes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of
inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs associated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are
expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales.

Our inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from
the ultimate disposition of inventory and establishes a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return
to our vendors for full credit. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded
markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis.

Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft). Physical inventory is
maintained through a combination of full location counts (typically once per year) and more regular cycle counts.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if they
are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.

When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of
an asset are capitalized and depreciated.

Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected
useful life of the software, generally from two years to seven years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use
software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software's functionality or extends its useful life. Capitalized software is
included in Fixtures and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the
period incurred. The costs of developing software for sale to customers is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
established, which generally leads to expensing substantially all costs.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Useful Life
5-35
2-10
2-15

Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying
value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less
than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of
the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment
loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value.

We evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis. For store locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values
may not be recoverable is negative store operating income for the most recent 12-month period. We also monitor other factors when
evaluating store locations for impairment, including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant
changes in our business strategies.

When reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we group long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For example, long-lived assets
deployed at store locations are reviewed for impairment at the individual store level, which involves comparing the net carrying value of
all assets to the net cash flow projections for each store. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as
appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets shared by several areas of operations, such as information
technology systems.

Leases

The majority of our lease obligations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our finance leases
are primarily equipment-related. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are
recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it is
determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For lease agreements
entered into or reassessed after the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all
classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets; we recognize
lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of
future payments over the lease term at the commencement date. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on
an evaluation of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for collateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar
payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. Our operating leases also typically require payment of
real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and
are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to
combine lease and non-lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are
reduced by lease incentives. Our lease terms generally do not include options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably
certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related
rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test
goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at
the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by identifying components of operating segments which constitute businesses
for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management. No components were
aggregated in arriving at our reporting units. We have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with
carrying values of $443 million and $541 million, respectively, as of February 1, 2020.

Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair
value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction and
typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples when applicable. If the fair
value exceeds carrying value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically

48

Table of Contents

valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the
carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an
amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.

Intangible Assets

Our valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of
acquisition, using income and market approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate.

We amortize our definite-lived intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the asset. We do not amortize our indefinite-lived
tradename, but test for impairment annually, or when indications of potential impairment exist. We utilize the relief from royalty method
to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived tradename. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment
loss in an amount equal to the excess.

Derivatives

Net Investment Hedges

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of
our net investment in our Canadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we
recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income
to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We
limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to circumstances such as complete or
substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and losses, if any, related
to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.

Interest Rate Swaps

We utilized "receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate" interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our
$650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (“2021 Notes”) and on our $500 million principal amount of notes due
October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”). Our interest rate swap contracts are considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional
amounts match those of our fixed-rate debt being hedged and are, therefore, accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut
method. Under the shortcut method, we recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the
carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the
derivatives.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to
recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up
to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on
these contracts directly to net earnings.

Fair Value

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To
measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:

Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either
directly or indirectly, including:

•   Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
•   Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;
•
•

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.

Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant
management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s
estimates of market participant assumptions.

The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair
value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair
value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.

49

Table of Contents

Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and
other intangible assets, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For these assets, we do not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we determine that
impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair value and the difference is recorded within SG&A and
Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non-restructuring and restructuring charges, respectively.

Fair value remeasurements are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected to
generate. The key inputs to the DCF model generally include our forecasts of net cash generated from revenue, expenses and other
significant cash outflows, such as capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate.

Insurance

We are self-insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, medical and general liability claims; however, we obtain third-
party excess insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims. Some of these self-insured losses are managed through a
wholly-owned insurance captive. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but
not yet reported. We utilize valuations provided by qualified, independent third-party actuaries as well as internal insurance and risk
expertise. Our self-insured liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows ($ in millions):

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We record a valuation allowance to
reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent
differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of
the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events
becomes available. Discrete events, such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws, are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax authorities. At any one time, multiple tax
years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we
may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a
liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the
period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to
examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including
accrued penalties and interest, in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Income tax expense on our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Accrued Liabilities

The major components of accrued liabilities are sales tax liabilities, advertising accruals, loyalty program liabilities, sales return
reserves, customer deposits and insurance liabilities.

Long-Term Liabilities

The major components of long-term liabilities are unrecognized tax benefits, income tax liabilities, self-insurance reserves and deferred
taxes.

Foreign Currency

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our
Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. For operations reported on a one-month lag, we use the exchange rates in effect one month prior to
our Consolidated Balance Sheet dates. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates
throughout the periods. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of
shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are
included in SG&A, have not been significant in any period presented.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue from the sale of products and services, both as a principal and as an agent. Revenue is recognized when control
of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we
expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and is
reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and contract cancellations based on historical refund rates,
with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. We defer the revenue associated with any unsatisfied performance obligation until the
obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed.

Product Revenue

Product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical control, either in our stores or at their home. Any fees charged to
customers for delivery are a component of the transaction price and are recognized when delivery has been completed. We use
delivery information at an individual contract level to determine when to recognize revenue for delivered products and any related
delivery fee revenue.

In most cases, we are the principal to product contracts as we have control of the physical products prior to transfer to the customer.
Accordingly, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily activation-based software licenses and third-party
stored-value cards, we are the sales agent providing access to the content and recognize commission revenue net of amounts due to
third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control passes upon providing access of the content to the
customer.

Warranty obligations associated with the sale of our exclusive brands products are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of
the product’s intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract.

Services - When we are the principal

We recognize revenue for services, such as installation, set-up, software troubleshooting, product repair, consultation and educational
classes once the service is completed, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the
service or serviced product. Payment terms are typically at the point of sale, but may also occur upon completion of the service. Our
service contracts are primarily with retail customers, merchandise vendors (for factory warranty repairs) and third-party underwriters
who sell extended warranty protection plans.

For technical support membership contracts (for example, our Total Tech Support offering), we are responsible for fulfilling the support
services to customers. These contracts have terms ranging from one month to three years and typically contain several performance
obligations. Payment for the membership contracts is due at the start of the contract period. We have determined that our contracts do
not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our payment terms is to provide customers with a simplified
method of purchasing our services, not to provide customers with financing. For performance obligations provided over time, we
recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method is derived by
analysis of historical utilization patterns as this depicts when customers use the services and, accordingly, when delivery of the
performance obligation occurs. There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts;
(2) measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only
bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations, or alternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and, (3)
assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current and future usage patterns. When
insufficient history of usage is available, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract.

Services - When we are the agent

On behalf of third-party underwriters, we sell various hardware protection plans to customers that provide extended warranty coverage
on their device purchases. Such plans have terms ranging from one month to five years. Payment is due at the point of sale. Third-party
underwriters assume the risk associated with the coverage and are primarily responsible for fulfillment. We record the net commissions
(the amount charged to the customer less the premiums remitted to the underwriter) as revenue at a point in time when the
corresponding product revenue is recognized. In addition, in some cases we are eligible to receive profit-sharing payments, a form of
variable consideration, which are dependent upon the financial performance of the underwriter’s protection plan portfolio. We do not
share in any losses of the portfolio. We record any profit share as revenue once the uncertainty associated with the portfolio period,
which is calendar-year based, is no longer constrained using the expected value method. This typically occurs during our fiscal fourth
quarter, with payment of the profit share occurring in the subsequent fiscal year. Service and commission revenues earned from the
sale of extended warranties represented approximately 2% of revenue in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.

We earn commissions from mobile network carriers to sell service contracts on their platforms. Revenue is recognized when control
passes at a point in time upon sale of the contract and activation of the customer on the provider’s platform. The time between when we
activate the service with the customer and when we receive payment from the content provider is generally within 30 to 60 days, which
is after control has passed. Activation commissions are subject to repayment to the carrier primarily in the event of customer
cancellation for specified time periods after the sale. Commission revenue from mobile network carriers is reported net of the expected
cancellations, which we estimate based on historical cancellation rates.

51

Table of Contents

Credit Card Revenue

We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers.
Approximately 25% of revenue in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was transacted using one of our branded cards. We provide a
license to our brand and marketing services, and we facilitate credit applications in our stores and online. The banks are the sole
owners of the accounts receivable generated under the program and, accordingly, we do not hold any customer receivables related to
these programs and act as an agent in the financing transactions with customers. We are eligible to receive a profit share from certain
of our banking partners based on the annual performance of their corresponding portfolio, and we receive quarterly payments based on
forecasts of full-year performance. This is a form of variable consideration. We record such profit share as revenue over time using the
most likely amount method, which reflects the amount earned each quarter when it is determined that the likelihood of a significant
revenue reversal is not probable, which is typically quarterly. Profit-share payments occur quarterly, shortly after the end of each
program quarter.

Best Buy Gift Cards

We sell Best Buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores, online and through select third parties. Our gift cards do not expire. We
recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer. We also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card
values that is not expected to be redeemed ("breakage"). We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as
laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer
redemption patterns. Typically, over 90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of over 90% of gift card breakage revenue)
occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage
rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage
income was $35 million, $34 million and $40 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

Sales Incentives

We frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a gift card at the time of purchase or an instant savings
coupon that can be redeemed towards a future purchase. For sales incentives issued to customers that are only earned in conjunction
with the purchase of products or services, the sales incentives represent an option that is a material right and, accordingly, is a
performance obligation in the contract. The revenue allocated to these sales incentives is deferred as a contract liability and is based on
the cards or coupons that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation when it is redeemed by
the customer or when it is not expected to be redeemed. There is judgment in determining (1) the level at which we group incentives
based on similar redemption patterns, (2) future redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate number of incentives that we do not expect to
be redeemed.

We also issue coupons that are not earned in conjunction with a purchase of a product or service, typically as part of targeted
marketing activities. This is not a performance obligation, but is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price when redeemed by
the customer.

Customer Loyalty Programs

We have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our co-
branded credit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Depending on
the customer's membership level within our loyalty program, certificate expirations typically range from 2 to 6 months from the date of
issuance. Our loyalty programs represent customer options that provide a material right and, accordingly, are performance obligations
for each applicable contract. The relative standalone selling price of points earned by our loyalty program members is deferred and
included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of points that are projected to be
redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation over time when a certificate is estimated to be redeemed by the
customer. There is inherent judgment in estimating the value of our customer loyalty programs as they are susceptible to factors
outside of our influence, particularly customer redemption activity. However, we have significant experience in estimating the amount
and timing of redemptions of certificates, based primarily on historical data.

Vendor Allowances

We receive funds from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or
sales-based volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores. We recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales
when the associated inventory is sold. If the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes, the funds are recognized
ratably over the performance period as the product promotion is completed. Funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of
specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when
incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed over the period in which the advertisement is customer-facing.
Advertising costs consist primarily of digital and television advertisements, as well as agency fees and production costs. Advertising
expenses were $840 million, $777 million and $776 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

We apply the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance as they relate to our stock-based compensation, which requires
us to recognize expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the
period in which services are required. It is recognized on a straight-line basis, except where there are performance awards that vest on
a graded basis, in which case the expense for these awards is front-loaded or recognized on a graded-attribution basis.

Comprehensive income (loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity. In
addition to net earnings, the significant component of comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments.

2.  Acquisitions

GreatCall, Inc.

On October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. (“GreatCall”) for net cash consideration of $787 million.
GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers, offers easy-to-use mobile products and connected
devices, tailored for seniors. These products are combined with a range of services, including a simple, one-touch connection to U.S.-
based, specially-trained agents who can connect the user to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency
personnel. The acquisition of GreatCall is aligned with our strategy to address health and wellness with a focus on aging consumers
and how technology can help them live more independent lives.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. All of the goodwill was
assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit within our Domestic reportable segment, the majority of which was deductible for income
tax purposes. We recorded $13 million of transaction costs in fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition within SG&A expenses on our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operations from the date of acquisition were included within our Best Buy Health
operating segment, Domestic reportable segment and our Services revenue category. The acquisition of GreatCall was not material to
the results of our operations.

Critical Signal Technologies, Inc.

On May 9, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Critical Signal Technologies, Inc. (“CST”), a health services company, for
net cash consideration of $125 million. The acquisition of CST is aligned with our strategy to address health and wellness with a focus
on aging seniors and how technology can help them live longer in their homes.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The purchase price allocation
for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete, but may be subject to immaterial changes. The acquired
assets were primarily comprised of $83 million of customer relationships (amortized over 15 years) recorded within Other assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill of $52 million was recorded and assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and is not
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded $3 million of transaction costs in fiscal 2020 related to the acquisition
within SG&A expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Results of operations from the date of acquisition were included
within our Best Buy Heath operating segment, Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition of CST is
not material to the results of our operations.

BioSensics, LLC

On August 7, 2019, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, LLC (“BioSensics”) for net cash
consideration of $20 million, primarily comprised of $19 million of goodwill and $4 million of definite-lived technology (amortized over 3
years). Goodwill, which was assigned to our Domestic reporting unit, is deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition currently supports
our health strategy and is included in our Domestic operating and reportable segments. The transaction was accounted for as a
business combination and is not material to the results of our operations.

active market.

(5)  Valued using select mutual fund performance that trade with sufficient frequency and volume to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash, receivables, accounts payable and other payables approximated their carrying values because of the short-
term nature of these instruments. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified
as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values for other investments held at cost are not readily available, but we estimate that the
carrying values for these investments approximate their fair values.

5.   Derivative Instruments

We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain risks by using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the
effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations, and interest rate
swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our 2021 Notes and 2028 Notes. In addition, we use foreign currency forward
contracts not designated as hedging instruments to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to
recognized receivable and payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies.

Our derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges and interest rate swaps are recorded on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value. See Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for gross fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments and

Short-Term Debt

U.S. Revolving Credit Facility

On April 17, 2018, we entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the "Facility") with a
syndicate of banks. The Facility permits borrowings of up to $1.25 billion and expires in April 2023, with no borrowings outstanding as
of February 1, 2020, and February 2, 2019.

The interest rate under the Facility is variable and, barring certain events of default, is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the
greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate
plus, in each case, 0.5%, and (3) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), subject to certain adjustments plus 1%, and
(b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable margin rate (the “LIBOR Margin”). In addition, a facility
fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are based upon our current senior
unsecured debt rating. Under the Facility, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.00% to 0.30%, the LIBOR Margin ranges from 0.80% to
1.30% and the facility fee ranges from 0.08% to 0.20%.

The Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other
things, these covenants restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens on certain assets; make material changes in
corporate structure or the nature of our business; dispose of material assets; engage in certain mergers, consolidations and other
fundamental changes; or engage in certain transactions with our affiliates. The Facility also contains covenants that require us to
maintain a maximum quarterly cash flow leverage ratio and a minimum quarterly interest coverage ratio. The Facility contains default
provisions including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest or principal when due and failure to comply with covenants. At
February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the
uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19. The interest rate for this draw under the Facility is variable at the 7-day LIBOR plus a
variable margin rate of 1.015%. The proceeds and resulting liability from the Facility will be included in Cash and cash equivalents and
Short-term debt, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

2021 Notes

In March 2011, we issued $650 million principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021 Notes bear interest
at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on
September 15, 2011. The 2021 Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting discounts of $4
million, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the 2021 Notes of $644 million.

We may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal
amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to the
redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as described
in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2021 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event
occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2021 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.

The 2021 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated
debt. The 2021 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and
lease-back transactions.

2028 Notes

In September 2018, we issued $500 million principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The 2028 Notes bear
interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2019. Net
proceeds from the issuance were $495 million after underwriting and issuance discounts totaling $5 million.

We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal
amount, and (ii) the sum of the present values of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest discounted to the
redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to the redemption date as described
in the indenture (including the supplemental indenture) relating to the 2028 Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event
occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the remaining unredeemed 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.

The 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated
debt. The 2028 Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt secured by liens or to enter into sale and
lease-back transactions.

Fair Value and Future Maturities

See Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair value of long-term debt.

At February 1, 2020, the future maturities of long-term debt, net of interest rate swaps and excluding debt discounts, issuance costs

7.   Shareholders' Equity

Stock Compensation Plans

Our Best Buy Co., Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan") authorizes us to grant or issue non-
qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity awards
up to a total of 22.5 million shares. We have not granted incentive stock options under the Omnibus Plan. Under the terms of the
Omnibus Plan, awards may be granted to our employees, officers, advisers, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the
Omnibus Plan vest as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of
grant. Awards granted, forfeited or canceled under the previous plan, the 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, after
February 1, 2014, adjust the amount available under the Omnibus Plan. At February 1, 2020, a total of 9.4 million shares were available
for future grants under the Omnibus Plan.

Upon adoption and approval of the Omnibus Plan, all of our previous equity incentive compensation plans were terminated. However,
existing awards under those plans continued to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule and will expire at the end of their
original terms.

Our outstanding stock options have a 10-year term. Outstanding stock options issued to employees generally vest over a three year
period. Share awards vest based either upon attainment of specified goals or solely upon continued employment ("time-based").
Outstanding share awards that are not time-based vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based upon our total shareholder
return ("TSR") compared to the TSR of companies that comprise Standard & Poor's 500 Index ("market-based") or upon the
achievement of company performance goals ("performance-based"). Generally, time-based share awards vest 33% on each of the
three annual anniversary dates following the grant date. Time-based share awards to directors vest one year from the grant date.

stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise price of the option) exercised during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, was
$59 million, $33 million and $57 million, respectively. At February 1, 2020, there was $10 million of unrecognized compensation
expense related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $40 million, $30 million and $156 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and
fiscal 2018, respectively.

There was $14 million, $7 million and $19 million of income tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in fiscal 2020,
fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

On February 23, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. There is no expiration date
governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.

Between the end of fiscal 2020 on February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020, we repurchased an incremental 0.6 million shares of our
common stock at a cost of $56 million. We have since temporarily suspended all share repurchases. Repurchased shares have been
retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.

8.  Revenue

We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of products and services. Contract balances primarily
consist of receivables and contract liabilities related to product merchandise not yet delivered to customers, unredeemed gift cards,
services not yet completed, and options that provide a material right to customers, such as our customer loyalty programs. Contract
balances were as follows ($ in millions):

contract liabilities at the beginning of the respective periods.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we made changes primarily related to our U.S. retail operating model to increase organization
effectiveness and create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. All charges incurred, including $10 million related
to a voluntary early retirement offer, related to termination benefits from continuing operations within our Domestic segment.

Best Buy Mobile

On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. This
decision was a result of changing economics in the mobile industry since we began opening these stores in 2006, along with the
integration of our mobile model into our core stores and on-line channel, which are more economically compelling today. All charges
incurred were from continuing operations within our Domestic segment. No restructuring accrual related to this plan remains as of
February 1, 2020.

In accordance with the prior guidance, ASC 840, Leases, our leases were previously designated as either capital, financing or
operating. Previously designated capital leases are now considered finance leases under the new guidance, ASC 842, Leases, while
our previously existing financing leases have been derecognized and reclassified as operating leases. The designation of operating
leases remains substantially unchanged under the new guidance. The future minimum lease payments by fiscal year as determined
prior to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, under our previously designated capital, financing and operating leases (not including
contingent rent) as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, were as follows ($ in

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. Among other
things, the Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, broadened the base to which U.S.
income tax applies, imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously
subject to U.S. income tax and changed how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. income tax.

In response to the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which
provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts to the extent
they were reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information became available, not to extend beyond the
measurement period of one year from the enactment of the Tax Act.

As a result of the Tax Act, our blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 33.7% for fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded
provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 of $283 million. The $283 million included a $209 million charge associated with the deemed
repatriation tax and a $74 million charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new 21.0% tax rate.

In accordance with SAB 118, we completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded the following
adjustments to the provisional tax expense during fiscal 2019: (1) a $20 million reduction to the deemed repatriation tax liability,
resulting in a final tax liability of $189 million, and (2) a $3 million reduction to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to
reflect the new tax rate, resulting in a net revaluation charge of $71 million.

At February 1, 2020, we had deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards from international operations of $78 million, of
which $73 million will expire in various years through 2037 and the remaining amounts have no expiration; acquired U.S. federal net
operating loss carryforwards of $15 million, of which $11 million will expire in various years between 2023 and 2037 and the remaining
amounts have no expiration; U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $6 million, which expire between 2024 and 2030; U.S.
federal capital loss carryforwards of $4 million, which expire between 2023 and 2025; state credit carryforwards of $8 million, which
expire between 2022 and 2039; state net operating loss carryforwards of $6 million, which expire between 2021 and 2039; international
credit carryforwards of $2 million, which have no expiration; and international capital loss carryforwards of $8 million, which have no
expiration.

At February 1, 2020, a valuation allowance of $96 million had been established, of which $5 million is against U.S. federal foreign tax
credit carryforwards; $8 million is against international capital loss carryforwards; $78 million is against international and state net
operating loss carryforwards; $1 million is against international credit carryforwards; and $4 million is against other state deferred tax
assets. The $5 million increase from February 2, 2019, is primarily due to the current year loss activity from international net operating
loss carryforwards, as well as the acquired state net operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the expiration of certain
international net operating loss carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $300 million, $282 million and $263 million at February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018,
respectively, would favorably impact our effective income tax rate if recognized.

We recognize interest and penalties (not included in the "unrecognized tax benefits" above), as well as interest received from favorable
tax settlements, as components of income tax expense. Interest expense of $11 million, interest expense of $10 million and interest
income of $10 million was recognized in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. At February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019,
and February 3, 2018, we had accrued interest of $67 million, $53 million and $42 million, respectively.

We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few
exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years
before fiscal 2011.

Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase or decrease our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income
tax examinations and controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by
the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive
additional assessments by various tax authorities or reach resolutions of income tax examinations or controversies in one or more
jurisdictions. These assessments, resolutions, or law changes could result in changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. The
actual amount of any changes could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any assessments, resolutions or
law changes. An estimate of the amount or range of such changes cannot be made at this time.

12.   Benefit Plans

We sponsor retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Participants may choose from various
investment options, including a fund comprised of our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their eligible
compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100% of the
first 3% of participating employees' contributions and 50% of the next 2%. Employer contributions vest immediately. The total employer
contributions were $73 million, $67 million and $62 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.

We offer a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for highly-compensated employees and members of our Board of
Directors. Amounts contributed and deferred under the plan are invested in options offered under the plan and elected by the
participants. The liability for compensation deferred under the plan was $22 million and $23 million at February 1, 2020,
and February 2, 2019, respectively, and is included in Long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4, Fair Value
Measurements, for the fair value of assets held for deferred compensation.

13.   Contingencies and Commitments

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Where appropriate, we have made accruals with respect to these matters, which are
reflected on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there are cases where liability is not probable or the amount cannot be
reasonably estimated and, therefore, accruals have not been made. We provide disclosure of matters where we believe it is reasonably
possible the impact may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We had outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate fair value of $81 million at February 1, 2020.

16.   Subsequent Events

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic, and
we expect our operations in all locations to be affected as the virus continues to proliferate. We have adjusted certain aspects of our
operations to protect our employees and customers while still meeting customers’ needs for vital technology. We will continue to
monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures. In light of the uncertainty as to the severity and
duration of the pandemic, the impact on our revenues, profitability and financial position is uncertain at this time.

On March 19, 2020, we drew down the full amount of the Facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the
uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19. See Note 6, Debt, for additional information. We also temporarily suspended all share
repurchases.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. We have established a Disclosure Committee, consisting of certain members of management, to assist in this
evaluation. Our Disclosure Committee meets on a quarterly basis and more often if necessary.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), as of February 1, 2020.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of February 1, 2020, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.
