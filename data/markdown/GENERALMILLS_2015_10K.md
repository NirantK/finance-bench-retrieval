PART I

ITEM 1

Business

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean
General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates
otherwise.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of
branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. We manufacture our products in
16 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two
strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.

We offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience and value for consumers around the world, with a focus on
five large global categories:

•

•

•

•

•

   ready-to-eat cereal;

   convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;

   snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;

   yogurt; and

   super-premium ice cream.

Other significant product categories include:

•

•

•

   baking mixes and ingredients;

   refrigerated and frozen dough; and

   frozen and shelf-stable vegetables.

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside
North America and our Häagen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales
contributed by each class of similar products, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

We manage and review the financial results of our business under three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores
and Foodservice. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this
report for a description of our segments. For financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Customers. Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount
chains, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, and convenience stores. We generally sell to these
customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products or to serve certain types of
customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

During fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates (Wal-Mart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of
our net sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. Wal-Mart also
represented 7 percent of our net sales in the International segment and 9 percent of our net sales in the Convenience Stores and Foodservice
segment. As of May 31, 2015, Wal-Mart accounted for 29 percent of our U.S. Retail receivables, 6 percent of our International receivables, and
9 percent of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice receivables. The five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 54
percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for 24 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales,
and the five largest customers in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment accounted for 44 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales.

Competition. The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The food categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all
have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product
quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer relationships,
superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an efficient supply
chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional brands
and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and
local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), sugar, dairy products,
vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic
and metal packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased
from suppliers in the United States. In our international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported
from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources
of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations.
We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able
to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our
business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production
needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our
products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk
management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of,
various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at fair market value and uses
derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement,
packaging, and exploratory research in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $229 million in fiscal
2015, $244 million in fiscal 2014, and $238 million in fiscal 2013.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Our products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global operations (set
forth in italics in this report) include Annie’s, Betty Crocker , Bisquick , Bugles , Cascadian Farm , Cheerios , Chex , Cinnamon Toast Crunch ,
Cocoa Puffs , Cookie Crisp , Fiber One , Food Should Taste Good , Fruit by the Foot , Fruit Gushers , Fruit Roll-Ups , Gardetto’s , Go-Gurt ,
Gold Medal , Golden Grahams , Green Giant , Häagen-Dazs , Helpers , Jeno’s , Jus-Rol , Kitano , Kix , La Salteña , Lärabar , Latina ,
Liberté , Lucky Charms , Muir Glen , Nature Valley , Oatmeal Crisp , Old El Paso , Pillsbury , Progresso , Raisin Nut Bran , Total , Totino’s ,
Trix , Wanchai Ferry , Wheaties , Yoki , and Yoplait . We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other
jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly
maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as
long as the trademarks are in use.

Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others, including Reese’s Puffs for
cereal, Hershey’s for a variety of products, Weight Watchers as an endorsement for yogurt and soup, and Cinnabon for refrigerated dough,
frozen pastries, and baking products. Our fruit snacks business uses a variety of licensed trademarks, including Mott’s , Minions , Sunkist ,
Scooby Doo , Batman , Tom and Jerry , Hello Kitty , Thomas the Tank Engine , and various Warner Bros. and Nickelodeon characters. Our
yogurt business uses a variety of licensed trademarks, including various Disney, Marvel, Warner Bros., and Nickelodeon characters.

Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestlé trademark. Nestlé licenses certain of its trademarks
to CPW, including the Nestlé and Uncle Toby’s trademarks. The Häagen-Dazs trademark is licensed royalty-free exclusively to Nestlé for ice
cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada. The Häagen-Dazs trademark is also licensed to HDJ. The J. M.
Smucker Company holds an exclusive royalty-free license to use the Pillsbury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy character in the dessert mix
and baking mix categories in the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico. The Green Giant trademark is licensed
to a third party for use in connection with its sale of fresh produce in the United States and Europe.

The Yoplait trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest.
These marks are licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a 51 percent interest. Yoplait SAS licenses these trademarks
to its franchisees. The Liberté trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50
percent interest.

We continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products. We consider the collective rights under our various
patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single
patent or group of related patents.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our U.S. Retail segment demand for refrigerated
dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso soup and Green Giant
canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, demand for Häagen-Dazs ice cream is higher during
the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these
demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our International segment net sales are generally
evenly balanced throughout the year.

BACKLOG

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any
unfilled orders as of May 31, 2015, was not material.

WORKING CAPITAL

A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices are
described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

EMPLOYEES

As of May 31, 2015, we had approximately 42,000 full- and part-time employees.

FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various
federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission,
Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As of May 31, 2015, we were involved with two active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances
or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey. These matters involve several different actions, including
administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state, local, and
foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general
with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

ITEM 1A  Risk Factors

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations
could be adversely affected.

The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial,
marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with
regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is
based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes,
we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market
share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in
introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are
unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over
generic and private label products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.

There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large
retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on
their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are
unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond
to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer for an extended
length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. For more information on significant customers, please see Company Overview in
Item 1 of this report.

Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.

The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product
scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy
policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are
unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We
do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we
intend.

8

Table of Contents

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our
gross margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils
(principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently,
resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements
of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing
process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at fair value. We
may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.

If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we
operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly
competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity
gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our
competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such
manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We are
currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we
are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or
distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack,
pandemic, strikes, import restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate
steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a
product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional
resources to restore our supply chain.

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients.

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or
ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or
cause production and delivery disruptions.

If our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product
liability claims if consumers are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in
significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period
of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability
case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have
an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their
preferences. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from

9

Table of Contents

time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and
trends, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn
cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health
effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or
attributes.

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business
faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding
innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market
share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth
may slow, which could adversely affect our profitability.

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty,
consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those
circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In
addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins.
Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Convenience
Stores and Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.

Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is
based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due
to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our
failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about
food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third
parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our
brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable
perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.

Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.

In fiscal 2015, 29 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of
risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:
•    political and economic instability;
•    exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
•    nationalization of operations;
•    compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
•    foreign tax treaties and policies; and
•    restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.

Table of Contents

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could
cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling,
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are
intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our
exposure.

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal
Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
agencies relating to the production, packaging, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our
employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies,
including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or
deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our
right to advertise our products, including proposals to limit advertising to children. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional
regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely
affected.

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws
and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental
remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on
current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our
estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed
our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our
ability to pay dividends.

As of May 31, 2015, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $10.4 billion. The agreements under which we
have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit
our:

•    ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings

assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and

•    flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic

conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any
of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity
and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial
performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.

11

Table of Contents

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the
operations of our suppliers and customers.

We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating
cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for
the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity
or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective
in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our
suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined
benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded
with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health
care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit
plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations
or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.

Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology
networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes
and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively
manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration,
and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers,
customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees and proprietary business information.
Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage,
interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures,
telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential
risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data
stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in
transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology
systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to
value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net
worth.

As of May 31, 2015, we had $13.1 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested
for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the
carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. If the fair value of the net assets of the
reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a
discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also
make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

12

Table of Contents

While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could
result in significant impairment losses.

We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Pillsbury , Totino’s , Progresso , Green
Giant , Yoplait , Old El Paso , Yoki , Häagen-Dazs , and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the
expected lives of other related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs
including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a
discount rate. Our Green Giant , Uncle Toby’s , and Mountain High brands have experienced declining business performance, and we will
continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.

From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part,
upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could
suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the
acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in
which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-
related intangible assets.

ITEM 7  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We
work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition,
we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising.
We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales,
segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key drivers of financial performance for our
business.

Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver:

•

•

•

•

   low single-digit annual growth in net sales;

   mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit;

   high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; and

   improvement in return on average total capital.

We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders.
We return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Our fiscal 2015 performance was mixed. Our two smaller operating segments delivered growth. Operating profit for the Convenience Stores
and Foodservice segment increased 15 percent to an all-time high of $353 million. Operating results for the International segment were muted
by a significant negative impact from foreign currency exchange and slowing economic growth in key emerging markets, but the segment
achieved good margin expansion and profit growth in constant currency. Results for our U.S. Retail segment were disappointing, as both net
sales and segment operating profit declined. Our brands achieved share gains in categories representing 65 percent of our products’ sales in
measured U.S. retail channels, but overall sales trends in many categories were weak, reflecting the impact of changing consumer food
preferences.

rd

Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015, declined 2 percent to $17.6 billion, as unfavorable foreign exchange offset
the benefits of a 53  week and six months of incremental contribution from the Annie’s Inc. (Annie’s) natural and organic foods business
acquired in October 2014. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 1 percent. Total segment operating profit of $3.0 billion declined 4
percent and 2 percent in constant currency. Diluted EPS declined 30 percent to $1.97 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain
items affecting comparability of results, rose 1 percent to $2.86 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis. These results
were in line with our expectations which were revised in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our return on average total capital declined 40 basis
points to 11.2 percent. (See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for discussion of total segment operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS,
constant-currency nets sales growth rates, constant-currency total segment operating profit growth rate, constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS
growth rate, and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).

Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $712 million in
fiscal 2015. We also returned significant cash to stockholders through an 8 percent dividend increase, and share repurchases totaling $1.2
billion.

We recorded the following achievements related to our other key operating objectives for fiscal 2015:

•

   Product improvements on established brands and new-product introductions designed to respond to evolving consumer food preferences
generated good growth for a variety of our product lines. Examples included renewed sales growth for our U.S. Yogurt operating unit;
strong sales contributions from protein-enriched

17

Table of Contents

cereal varieties; robust consumer demand across international markets for new Old El Paso Mexican food items; and double-digit growth
for our U.S. portfolio of natural and organic food products.

   The acquisition of Annie’s in October 2014 significantly expanded our scale and participation in the attractive U.S. natural and organic
food category. Combined net sales in the U.S. for our portfolio of natural and organic brands exceeded $570 million in fiscal 2015.

   We increased our share of U.S. cereal category measured dollar sales.

   We increased our share of U.S. yogurt category measured dollar sales, including strong gains in the Greek yogurt segment, and renewed
sales growth in the regular and child yogurt segments. Our international yogurt operations expanded to China with first production and
order shipments to the Shanghai market commencing near the end of the fiscal year.

•

•

•

•

   We generated strong levels of supply chain productivity savings in 2015 through our ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM)

efforts. Beyond this program, we began several new cost savings initiatives during the fiscal year. Project Century is our effort to simplify
our North American supply chain. Project Catalyst is focused on increasing the agility and effectiveness of our U.S. Retail and corporate
organizations, and we are making changes to various corporate policies and practices to reduce overhead expense. Together, these three
initiatives generated more than $75 million in cost savings during fiscal 2015, and they are expected to produce a cumulative $260 to
$280 million in savings in fiscal 2016.

•

   We delivered strong cash returns to stockholders through dividends of $1.67 per share and share repurchases totaling $1.2 billion. Share
repurchase activity in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reduced the average number of diluted shares outstanding in fiscal 2015 by 4 percent from
fiscal 2014.

A detailed review of our fiscal 2015 performance appears below in the section titled “Fiscal 2015 Consolidated Results of Operations.”

Our sales and earnings growth targets for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of one less week compared to fiscal 2015. The Annie’s business will
contribute 6 months of incremental results. We expect foreign currency exchange will continue to have a negative impact on reported results
for our international operations, and we expect the operating environment in our large developing markets (China and Brazil) to remain
uncertain. We estimate our input cost inflation for fiscal 2016 at 2 percent. With these assumptions in mind:

•

•

•

•

   We expect fiscal 2016 net sales to essentially match 2015 levels in constant currency, reflecting the impact of one less week of business.

   We expect fiscal 2016 total segment operating profit to increase at a low-single-digit rate in constant currency, as HMM and our more
recent cost-saving initiatives increase our efficiency and improve margins.

   We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted EPS to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in constant currency.

   Our fiscal 2016 plans call for continued strong cash returns to stockholders. The current annualized dividend rate of $1.76 per share is up

5 percent from the annual dividend paid in 2015. Share repurchases in fiscal 2016 are expected to result in a net reduction in average
diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 percent.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.

FISCAL 2015 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2015 had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2014.

Fiscal 2015 net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630 million and increased 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. In fiscal 2015, net earnings
attributable to General Mills were $1,221 million, down 33 percent from $1,824 million in fiscal 2014, and we reported diluted EPS of
$1.97 in fiscal 2015, down 30 percent from $2.83 in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 results include restructuring-related charges, an indefinite-lived
intangible asset impairment charge, tax impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings, losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain
commodity positions and grain inventories, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie’s, and the impact of Venezuela currency
devaluation. Fiscal 2014 results include the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, a gain on the divestiture of certain grain elevators,
losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and restructuring charges related to our fiscal
2012 productivity and cost savings plan. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.86 in fiscal 2015, up 1 percent
from $2.82 in fiscal 2014. Diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability on a constant-currency basis increased 4 percent
compared to fiscal 2014 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP).

Net sales declined 2 percent to $17,630 million in fiscal 2015 from $17,910 in fiscal 2014. The components of net sales growth are shown in

The 53  week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales growth, reflecting 1 percentage point of growth from
rd
volume.

Cost of sales increased $141 million in fiscal 2015 to $11,681 million. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90 million net increase in cost of sales
related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $49 million in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we recorded $60 million of
restructuring charges in cost of sales. Product mix drove a $17 million increase in cost of sales. We also recorded a $3 million foreign exchange
loss in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $23 million loss in fiscal 2014. Lower volume drove a $68 million
decrease in cost of sales.

We also expect to incur approximately $65 million of restructuring initiative project-related cash costs and recorded $13 million of these costs
in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Gross margin declined 7 percent in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34 percent decreased 190 basis
points compared to fiscal 2014.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $146 million in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 primarily due to a 5 percent
decrease in advertising and media expense, and savings from Project Catalyst (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this report) and our other cost management initiatives. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge related to Venezuela
currency devaluation compared to a $39 million charge in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $16 million of integration costs in fiscal 2015
related to our acquisition of Annie’s. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2014.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $544 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in fiscal 2014.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our
U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. As a result, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset.

Restructuring charges recorded in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs were $284 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $4 million in
fiscal 2014. Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:

activities.

There were no divestitures in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain
elevators in our U.S. Retail segment.

Interest, net for fiscal 2015 totaled $315 million, $13 million higher than fiscal 2014. Average interest bearing instruments increased $1,370
million, generating a $55 million increase in net interest. The average interest rate decreased 47 basis points, including the effect of the mix of
debt, generating a $42 million decrease in net interest.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 33.3 percent was consistent with fiscal 2014. The 4.5 percentage point impact resulting
from the repatriation of $606 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2015 was offset by changes in earnings mix by country, certain favorable
discrete items, and favorable state tax rate changes.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2015 decreased to $84 million compared to $90 million in fiscal 2014 primarily driven by

FISCAL 2015 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Cash and cash equivalents decreased $533 million from fiscal 2014, as discussed in the “Liquidity” section below.

Receivables decreased $97 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by timing of sales.

Inventories decreased $19 million from fiscal 2014.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $15 million from fiscal 2014.

Land, buildings, and equipment decreased $159 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by $108 million related to restructuring activities.

Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $113 million from fiscal 2014, driven by foreign exchange and a $260 million impairment
charge related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset, partially offset by the $858 million of intangible assets recorded in the acquisition of
Annie’s.

Other assets decreased $302 million from fiscal 2014, largely driven by a decrease in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans
primarily due to the adoption of new mortality tables for the annual remeasurement of the obligations associated with these plans.

Accounts payable increased $73 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the extension of payment terms and the timing of payments.

Notes payable and long-term debt, including current portion, increased $438 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by $1,107 million of
net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by net commercial paper payments.

The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability decreased $142 million from fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of
changes in the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.

Table of Contents

Other current liabilities increased $140 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by the establishment of restructuring reserves related to the
actions taken in fiscal 2015.

Other liabilities increased $102 million from fiscal 2014, largely driven by an increase in our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
liabilities primarily due to the adoption of new mortality tables for the annual remeasurement of the obligations associated with these plans.

Redeemable interest decreased $205 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by foreign exchange.

Retained earnings increased $204 million from fiscal 2014, reflecting fiscal 2015 net earnings of $1,221 million less dividends declared of
$1,018 million. Treasury stock increased $836 million from fiscal 2014, driven by $1,162 million of share repurchases, partially offset by
$326 million related to stock-based compensation plans. Additional paid in capital increased $65 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven
by redeemable interest revaluation, partially offset by stock compensation activity. AOCI increased by $970 million from fiscal 2014.

Noncontrolling interests decreased $75 million from fiscal 2014, primarily driven by foreign exchange.

FISCAL 2014 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our consolidated results for fiscal 2014 include one additional quarter of operating activity from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki)
in Brazil, one additional quarter of operating activity from the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license, and three additional
quarters of operating activity from the acquisition of Immaculate Baking Company in the United States. Collectively, these items are referred to
as “new businesses” in comparing our fiscal 2014 results to fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2014 net sales grew 1 percent to $17,910 million including 1 percentage point of growth contributed by new businesses and 1 percentage
point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2014,  net earnings attributable to General Mills  were $1,824 million, down 2
percent from $1,855 million in fiscal 2013, and we reported  diluted EPS  of $2.83 in fiscal 2014, up 1 percent from $2.79 in fiscal 2013.
Fiscal 2014 results include a gain on the divestiture of certain grain elevators, the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation, gains from the
mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012
productivity and cost savings plan. Fiscal 2013 results include the effects from various discrete tax items, the impact of Venezuela currency
devaluation, restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, integration costs resulting from the acquisition
of Yoki, and gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Diluted EPS excluding these items
affecting comparability totaled $2.82 in fiscal 2014, up 4 percent from $2.72 in fiscal 2013 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a
description of our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

Net sales grew 1 percent in fiscal 2014 to $17,910 from $17,774 in fiscal 2013. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following

Cost of sales  increased $190 million in fiscal 2014 to $11,540 million. Higher volume drove an $115 million increase in cost of sales. Product
mix also drove an $130 million increase in cost of sales. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $49 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-
to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $4 million in fiscal 2013. We also recorded a $23 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal
2014 related to the Venezuela currency devaluation compared to a $16 million loss in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $17
million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license.

Gross margin  declined 1 percent in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent was unchanged
compared to fiscal 2013.

SG&A expenses  decreased $78 million in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a 3 percent
decrease in advertising and media expense, a smaller contribution to the General Mills Foundation, a decrease in incentive compensation
expense, and lower pension expense compared to fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $39 million charge related to Venezuela currency
devaluation compared to a $9 million charge in fiscal 2013. In addition, we recorded $12 million of integration costs in fiscal 2013 related to
our acquisition of Yoki. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 1 percent compared to fiscal 2013.

During fiscal 2014, we recorded a divestiture gain of $66 million related to the sale of certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment.
There were no divestitures in fiscal 2013.

Interest, net  for fiscal 2014 totaled $302 million, $15 million lower than fiscal 2013. The average interest rate decreased 41 basis points,
including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $31 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $367
million, generating a $16 million increase in net interest.

Our consolidated  effective tax rate  for fiscal 2014 was 33.3 percent compared to 29.2 percent in fiscal 2013. The 4.1 percentage point
increase was primarily related to the restructuring of our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary during the first quarter of fiscal 2013,
which resulted in a $63 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC and certain
distributed assets, with a corresponding non-cash reduction to income taxes. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $34 million discrete
decrease in income tax expense and an increase in our deferred tax assets related to certain actions taken to restore part of the tax benefits
associated with Medicare Part D subsidies which had previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the enactment of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our fiscal 2013 tax expense also includes a
$12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures  for fiscal 2014 decreased to $90 million compared to $99 million in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by
increased consumer spending at CPW and unfavorable foreign currency exchange from HDJ. The change in net sales for each joint venture is

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Convenience Stores and Foodservice.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented
have been changed to conform to this presentation.

The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2015, 2014,

U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT

Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we realigned certain operating units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also
changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and
Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the
amounts previously reported in the net sales and net sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment to conform to the
new operating unit structure. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating segments’ net sales,
operating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In addition, results from the acquired Annie’s
business are included in the Meals and Snacks operating units.

Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains,
and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat
cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking
mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including meal kits, granola bars,
and cereal.

In fiscal 2015, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10,507 million, down 1 percent compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, net sales for
this segment totaled $10,605 million, flat compared to fiscal 2013. The components of U.S. Retail net sales growth are shown in the following

Segment operating profit of $2,159 million in fiscal 2015 declined $152 million, or 7 percent, from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily
driven by lower volume and an increase in supply chain costs, partially offset by a 6 percent reduction in advertising and media expense.

Segment operating profit of $2,312 million in fiscal 2014 declined $81 million, or 3 percent, from fiscal 2013. The decrease reflected higher
trade spending, partially offset by a 1 percent reduction in advertising and media expense.

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-
eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks,
refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen
desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States
for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures.
Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.

Net sales for our International segment were down 5 percent in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, to $5,128 million. Net sales totaled $5,386
million in fiscal 2014, up 4 percent from $5,200 million in fiscal 2013. The components of International net sales growth are shown in the

profit increased 9 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below
for our use of this measure).

Segment operating profit for fiscal 2014 grew 4 percent to $535 million from $515 million in fiscal 2013, primarily driven by volume growth,
favorable net price realization and mix, and an additional quarter of results from the Yoki acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable foreign
currency and higher input costs. In addition, we recorded a $17 million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian
Yoplait franchise license in fiscal 2013. International segment operating profit increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2014
compared to fiscal 2013 (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of this measure).

CONVENIENCE STORES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT

In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen
breakfasts, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and
nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience
stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substantially all of this segment’s operations are located in the United States.

For fiscal 2015, net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment increased 4 percent to $1,995 million. For fiscal 2014, net sales
decreased 2 percent to $1,919 million compared to $1,959 million in fiscal 2013. The components of Convenience Stores and Foodservice net
sales growth are shown in the following table:

The 53  week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of net sales growth, reflecting 2 percentage points of growth from

volume.

In fiscal 2015, segment operating profit was $353 million, up 15 percent from $307 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily driven
by favorable net price realization and mix and higher volume.

In fiscal 2014, segment operating profit was $307 million, down 2 percent from $315 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily driven
by volume declines, unfavorable net price realization, and investments to protect and grow the business.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed how we assess segment operating performance to exclude the asset and liability
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented
have been changed to conform to this presentation.

Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives,
contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative
project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses
from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as
discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

For fiscal 2015, unallocated corporate expense totaled $414 million compared to $258 million last year. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $90
million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $49
million net decrease in expense in fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $60 million of restructuring charges, and $13 million of restructuring
initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of
assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary compared to $62 million in fiscal 2014. We also recorded $16 million of integration costs
resulting from the acquisition of Annie’s in fiscal 2015.

For fiscal 2014, unallocated corporate expense totaled $258 million compared to $351 million in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a $49
million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $4
million net decrease in expense in the prior year. Compensation and benefit expenses decreased $59 million and the contribution to the General
Mills Foundation decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. We also recorded a $62 million foreign exchange loss related to the
remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2014 compared to $25 million in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, we
also recorded $12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Yoki.

Table of Contents

Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy, and we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the
exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in U.S. dollars. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government established a new foreign
exchange market mechanism (SICAD 2) and at that time indicated that it would be the market through which U.S. dollars would be obtained
for the remittance of dividends. On February 12, 2015, the Venezuelan government replaced SICAD 2 with a new foreign exchange market
mechanism (SIMADI). We expect to be able to access U.S. dollars through the SIMADI market. SIMADI has significantly higher foreign
exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8 million foreign
exchange loss in unallocated corporate items resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the
SIMADI rate of 199 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Our Venezuela operations represent less than 1 percent of our consolidated assets, liabilities, net
sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of non-U.S. dollar cash balances in Venezuela.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of 2 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodities inputs. We expect
input cost inflation of 2 percent in fiscal 2016. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating
practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

LIQUIDITY

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $8.0
billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We
also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and
long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions.

As of May 31, 2015, we had $311 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign
operations and acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time repatriation of $606 million of foreign
earnings. This action reduced the economic cost of funding current restructuring initiatives and the acquisition of Annie’s completed in fiscal
2015. We recorded a discrete income tax charge of $79 million in fiscal 2015 related to this action, and we expect to make approximately $24
million in related cash income tax payments related to this action. We have previously asserted that our foreign earnings are permanently
reinvested and will only be repatriated in a tax-neutral manner, and this one-time repatriation does not change this ongoing assertion.

In fiscal 2015, our operations generated $2.5 billion of cash, flat compared to fiscal 2014. The $247 million change in current assets and
liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of trade and promotion accruals, changes in tax accruals, and changes in derivative positions. This
was largely offset by lower net earnings, which included a $260 million non-cash impairment charge and $271 million of non-cash
restructuring charges, and a $147 million change in net deferred income taxes.

We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2015, core working capital decreased 13
percent, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable, compared to a net sales decline of 2 percent. In
fiscal 2014, core working capital decreased 9 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent, and in fiscal 2013, core working capital
decreased 5 percent, compared to net sales growth of 7 percent.

In fiscal 2014, our operations generated $2.5 billion of cash compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013. The $385 million decrease was primarily
due to a $503 million change in current assets and liabilities. The change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $403 million
change in other current liabilities largely due to changes in trade promotion and income tax accruals, and a $107 million change in inventory. In
addition, in fiscal 2013 we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans.

In fiscal 2015, cash used by investing activities increased by $1.0 billion from fiscal 2014. We invested $712 million in land, buildings, and
equipment in fiscal 2015, $49 million more than the same period last year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired Annie’s, a publicly
traded food company headquartered in Berkeley, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $809 million, net of $12 million of cash
acquired. We made $102 million of investments in affiliates, primarily CPW, in fiscal 2015. In addition, we received $28 million in payments
from Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in fiscal 2015 against the $132 million exchangeable note we purchased in fiscal 2012.

In fiscal 2014, cash used by investing activities decreased by $954 million from fiscal 2013. We invested $664 million in land, buildings, and
equipment in fiscal 2014, $50 million more than in fiscal 2013. We made $55 million of investments in affiliates, primarily CPW, in fiscal
2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold certain grain elevators for $124 million in cash, including a working capital adjustment
finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition we received $29 million in payments from Sodiaal in fiscal 2014 against the
exchangeable note.

We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $840 million in fiscal 2016. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to
fuel International growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain.

Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $439 million in fiscal 2015. We had $204 million less net debt issuances in fiscal 2015 than
the same period a year ago. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.

During fiscal 2015, we received $164 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $108 million in fiscal
2014, an increase of $56 million. During fiscal 2013, we received $301 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options.

In May 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the
authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative
instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.

During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for $1,162 million. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 36 million
shares of our common stock for $1,745 million. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for $1,015 million.

Dividends paid in fiscal 2015 totaled $1,018 million, or $1.67 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2014. Dividends paid in
fiscal 2014 totaled $983 million, or $1.55 per share, a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2013 dividends of $1.32 per share. On
March 10, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 5 percent dividend increase, effective with the May 1, 2015 payment, to an annualized rate
of $1.76 per share.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a
continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have
uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a
requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31,
2015, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

We have $1,000 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from
operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the
next 12 months.

As of May 31, 2015, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 72 percent in fixed-rate and 28
percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 71 percent in fixed-rate and 29 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 25, 2014.

Improvement in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our
discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased 40 basis points from 11.6 percent in
fiscal 2014 to 11.2 percent in fiscal 2015 as fiscal 2015 earnings declined. On a constant-currency basis, return on average total capital
decreased 20 basis points. We also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important
measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2015 was 5.54 compared to 8.04 in fiscal 2014. The measure
decreased from fiscal 2014 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased by $893 million including a
$260 million non-cash pretax charge related to an indefinite-lived intangible

32

Table of Contents

asset impairment and a $344 million pretax increase in restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 1.3
percentage points to 27.6 percent in fiscal 2015, driven by an increase in total debt.

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal
holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record
Sodiaal’s 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and their 49 percent interest in
Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported
in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value
once per year through a maximum term expiring December 2020. As of May 31, 2015, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was
$779 million which approximates its fair value.

The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net
income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-
to-market valuation (currently $252 million). For fiscal 2015, the floating preferred rate was equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110
basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a
remarketing auction. On June 1, 2015, subsequent to our year-end, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A Interests was reset to
the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points.

We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred
return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its
original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As of May 31, 2015, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $434 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated
subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $258 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW.
In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled
$400 million as of May 31, 2015.

As of May 31, 2015, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations,
financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 31, 2015.

(b)  Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(c)  The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of
business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a
pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with
short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are
excluded from the table above.

(d)  The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was

$133 million as of May 31, 2015, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of
cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for
accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $22 million of benefits from our unfunded
postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2016. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of
these payments beyond fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2015, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties
was $196 million.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of
operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable
interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

Promotional Expenditures

Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include:
payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to
lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising
expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on
the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated
expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer
marketing liabilities were $565 million as of May 31, 2015, and $578 million as of May 25, 2014. Because our total promotional expenditures
(including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in
subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is
measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are
determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales
and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the
expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis,
over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash
flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not
own the brands, and a discount rate.

As of May 31, 2015, we had $13.1 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of
each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially
different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) could result in
significant impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2015 assessment of our intangible assets as of November 24,
2014. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in
excess of the carrying values, except for the Mountain High , Uncle Toby’s, and Green Giant brands. The excess fair value above the carrying
value of these brand assets were as follows:

At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in
our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, future sales and profitability projections in our long-range plan for
this business declined. As a result of this triggering event, we performed an interim impairment assessment of the Green Giant brand intangible
asset as of May 31, 2015, and determined that the fair value of the brand asset no longer exceeded the carrying value of the asset. Significant
assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long-range cash flow projections for the Green Giant business, an updated royalty
rate, a WACC, and a tax rate. We recorded a $260 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 related to this asset.

Our Green Giant , Uncle Toby’s and Mountain High brands have experienced declining business performance, and we will continue to monitor
these businesses.

Redeemable Interest

During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a
discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and
profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of
May 31, 2015, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $779 million.

Stock-based Compensation

The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a
material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee
exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

Risk-free interest rate

1.6 %
  9.0 years
   17.3 %
3.5 %

The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at
the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by
2 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2015 volatility assumption would increase the
grant date fair value of our fiscal 2015 option awards by 7 percent.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final
intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as
explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions.
Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then
significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to
as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future
years’ financing cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship
between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial
reporting purposes.

Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits
(amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if
any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We
calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have
sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be
affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different
reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Income Taxes

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the
amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment
related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on
income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. We also
sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances,
we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of
Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.

We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we
make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that
require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and
accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our
benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate
of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term
inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year
does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets were 6.5 percent, 11.7 percent, 8.1 percent, 7.8 percent, and 9.6 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended
May 31, 2015.

On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percent for fiscal 2015, 8.53 percent for fiscal
2014, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2013.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $62
million for fiscal 2016. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation
recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this
purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the
market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income.

Discount Rates

Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected
future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve,
including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to
determine our discount rate assumptions.

38

Table of Contents

Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:

Obligations as of May 31, 2015, and fiscal 2016 expense
Obligations as of May 25, 2014, and fiscal 2015 expense

4.51 %
4.52 %

Postemployment

3.55 %
3.82 %
3.70 %

Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $167 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are
amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and
information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain
consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for
retirees age 65 and over and 6.5 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2015. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate
trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2025 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase
as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the
rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on
the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized,
experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required
being recorded.

Financial Statement Impact

In fiscal 2015, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $153 million
compared to $140 million of expense in fiscal 2014 and $159 million of expense in fiscal 2013. As of May 31, 2015, we had cumulative
unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.7 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $81 million on our postretirement and
postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the
values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses
because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.

39

Table of Contents

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their
lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries published RP-2014 Mortality Tables and
Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, which both reflect improved longevity. We adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to
remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans obligations, which increased the total of these obligations by
$437 million. In addition, these assumptions increased the fiscal 2016 expense associated with these plans by $72 million.

Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on
investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations
participating in these plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain
investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value
hierarchy and make a separate disclosure. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this
guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting requirements that permit reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a
month-end to apply a practical expedient to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the
entity’s fiscal year-end and apply the practice consistently to all plans. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We
do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The requirements of
the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

In June 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for share-based payment awards issued based upon specific performance targets.
The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide
useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors.

For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure
and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP
measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-
GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE
HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions. We also may make written or oral forward-looking statements,
including statements contained in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to stockholders.

The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” or similar
expressions identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those currently
anticipated or projected. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.

In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors
that could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from any current opinions or
statements.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, such as: competitive dynamics in the consumer foods industry and the markets for
our products, including new product introductions, advertising activities, pricing actions, and promotional activities of our competitors;
economic conditions, including changes in inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, or the availability of capital; product development and
innovation; consumer acceptance of new products and product improvements; consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion
levels; acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets; changes in capital structure; changes in the legal and regulatory environment,
including labeling and advertising regulations and litigation; impairments in the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or other
long-lived assets, or changes in the useful lives of other intangible assets; changes in accounting standards and the impact of significant
accounting estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product liability; changes in consumer demand for our products;
effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and promotional programs; changes in consumer behavior, trends, and preferences, including weight
loss trends; consumer perception of health-related issues, including obesity; consolidation in the retail environment; changes in purchasing and
inventory levels of significant customers; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply chain resources, including raw materials, packaging,
and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain; effectiveness of restructuring and cost savings initiatives; volatility in the market
value of derivatives used to manage price risk for certain commodities; benefit plan expenses due to changes in plan asset values and discount
rates used to determine plan liabilities; failure or breach of our information technology systems; foreign economic conditions, including
currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and economic uncertainty due to terrorism or war.

You should also consider the risk factors that we identify in Item 1A of this report, which could also affect our future results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

ITEM 7A  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in
these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to
these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these
activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our
hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information on interest rate, foreign
exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

46

Table of Contents

VALUE AT RISK

The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in
market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo value-at-risk
(VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95
percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the
potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics™ data set. The calculations
are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely
correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by
an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest
rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the
underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency,
commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 31, 2015, and May 25, 2014, and the average fair value impact
during the year ended May 31, 2015.

ITEM 8

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States, using management’s best
estimates and judgments where appropriate. The financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with our
consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and
transactions are recorded accurately in all material respects, in accordance with management’s authorization. We maintain a strong audit
program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate
separation of duties and responsibilities, and there are documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper financial reporting. These
formally stated and regularly communicated policies demand highly ethical conduct from all employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public
accounting firm to review internal control, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm,
internal auditors, and employees have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s annual financial statements. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board
of Directors approved, that the consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report. The Audit Committee also appointed
KPMG LLP to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2016.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
General Mills, Inc.:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2015 and May 25, 2014,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the
fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2015. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
audited the accompanying financial statement schedule. We also have audited General Mills, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
of May 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Table of Contents

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of General
Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2015 and May 25, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal
years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the
accompanying financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, General Mills, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial
interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are
eliminated in consolidation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal year 2015 consisted of 53 weeks, while fiscal years 2014 and 2013 consisted of 52
weeks.

Change in Reporting Period
As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2013 we changed the reporting period of Europe and
Australia within our International segment from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in
the year of change, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations compared to 12 months in following fiscal years. The
impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Yoki Alimentos
S.A. (Yoki), and India businesses remain on an April fiscal year end.

Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain
inventories and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at market with all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.

Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the
related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation
Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost
and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of
sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 to 50 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years.
Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its
cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 31, 2015, assets held
for sale were insignificant.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or
asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the
operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and
are largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the
asset

group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting
unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that
reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net
assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including
goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales
and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth
assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a
determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the
expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis,
over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino’s , Progresso , Green Giant ,
Yoplait , Old El Paso , Yoki , Häagen-Dazs , and Annie’s brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted
cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we
did not own the brands, and a discount rate.

Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be
recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of
the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would
be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or
other similar valuation model, as appropriate.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed
earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and
record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures
in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures,
generally at market prices.

In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not
limited to, ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business
disruptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending,
depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If
we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the
shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than
temporary.

Table of Contents

Redeemable Interest
We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent
interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value through a maximum term
expiring December 2020. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will
be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through
additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its
fair value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow
model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-
range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize sales revenue when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer
and are reported net of consumer coupon redemption, trade promotion and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable
product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded when
distributed, based on estimated redemption rates. Trade promotions are recorded based on estimated participation and performance levels for
offered programs at the time of sale. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval,
we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or
outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Terms and collection patterns vary around the world and by channel. The
allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined
based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem
the amount is uncollectible.

Environmental
Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed.
Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.

Advertising Production Costs
We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development
All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the year incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new
product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and
other supplies attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including
assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Foreign Currency Translation
For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the
period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation
adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not
planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and
losses are recorded in AOCI.

58

Table of Contents

Derivative Instruments
All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair
value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are
recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction
and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period
the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified
to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period.

Stock-based Compensation
We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units using the value of a share of our stock on the date of grant. We
estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock compensation is recognized straight line over the
vesting period. Our stock compensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible
employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on
providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as a financing cash flow, thereby reducing net operating
cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans
We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees.
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States and Canada and members
of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these
benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based
solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the
funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.

Use of Estimates
Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our
accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation,
income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our
estimates.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE

On October 21, 2014, we acquired Annie’s, Inc. (Annie’s), a publicly traded food company headquartered in Berkeley, California, for an
aggregate purchase price of $821.2 million, which we funded by issuing debt. We consolidated Annie’s into our Consolidated Balance Sheets
and recorded goodwill of $589.8 million, an indefinite lived intangible asset for the Annie’s brand of $244.5 million, and a finite lived customer
relationship asset of $23.9 million. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment for $124.0 million in cash and recorded a
pre-tax gain of $65.5 million.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT

In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $260 million charge related to the impairment of our Green Giant brand intangible asset in restructuring,
impairment, and other exit costs. See Note 6 for additional information.

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate
of return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major
stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities
result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees, and
decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our disclosures
regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value
of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is
recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.

We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind our key
growth strategies. Charges recorded in fiscal 2015 related to these initiatives were as follows:

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved Project Catalyst, a restructuring plan to increase organizational effectiveness and reduce
overhead expense. In connection with this project, we expect to eliminate approximately 800 positions primarily in the United States. We
expect to incur approximately $148 million of net expenses relating to these actions of which approximately $118 million will be cash. These
actions were largely completed in fiscal 2015.

Project Century (Century) is a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to streamline operations and identify
potential capacity reductions. In addition to the actions taken at certain facilities described below, we incurred $17.2 million of restructuring
charges in fiscal 2015 related to Century of which $6.0 million was cash.

As part of Century, we approved actions in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to reduce our refrigerated dough capacity and exit our Midland,
Ontario, Canada and New Albany, Indiana facilities, which support our U.S. Retail, International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice
supply chains. The Midland action will affect approximately 100 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $21 million of net expenses
relating to this action, of which approximately $12 million will be cash. We recorded $6.5 million of restructuring charges relating to this
action in fiscal 2015. The New Albany action will affect approximately 400 positions, and we expect to incur approximately $84 million of net
expenses relating to this action of which approximately $44 million will be cash. We recorded

60

Table of Contents

$51.3 million of restructuring charges relating to this action in fiscal 2015. We anticipate these actions will be completed by the end of fiscal
2018.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to consolidate yogurt manufacturing capacity and exit our Methuen,
Massachusetts facility in our U.S. Retail and Convenience Stores and Foodservice supply chains as part of Century. This action will affect
approximately 250 positions. We recorded $43.6 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $69 million
of net expenses relating to this action of which approximately $18 million will be cash. We expect this action to be completed by the end of
fiscal 2016.

Also as part of Century, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a restructuring plan to eliminate excess cereal and dry mix
capacity and exit our Lodi, California facility in our U.S. Retail supply chain. This action will affect approximately 430 positions. We recorded
$63.2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $102 million of net expenses relating to this action of
which approximately $41 million will be cash. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a plan to combine certain Yoplait and General Mills operational facilities within our
International segment to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. This action will affect approximately 240 positions. We recorded $13.9 million
of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015. We expect to incur approximately $15 million of net expenses relating to this action and to make
approximately $14 million in cash payments. We expect this action to be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.

In fiscal 2015, we paid $63.6 million in cash related to restructuring initiatives.

In addition to restructuring charges, we expect to incur approximately $65 million of additional project-related costs, which will be recorded in
cost of sales, all of which will be cash. We recorded $13.2 million in cost of sales for project-related costs in fiscal 2015.

Subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year end, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we approved Project Compass, a restructuring plan designed to enable
our International segment to accelerate long-term growth through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. In
connection with this initiative, we expect to eliminate approximately 675 to 725 positions. We expect to record total restructuring charges of
approximately $57 to $62 million, primarily reflecting one-time employee termination benefits, of which approximately $54 to $57 million will
be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect approximately $54 to $59 million of the total expense will result in future cash
expenditures. These restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2017.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we reorganized certain reporting units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. Our chief operating
decision maker continues to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to our segments at the U.S. Retail,
International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice operating segment level.

We performed our fiscal 2015 impairment assessment as of the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2015, and determined there was no
impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values.

We performed our fiscal 2015 impairment assessment as of the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As of our assessment date, there was
no impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values,
except for the  Mountain High, Uncle Toby’s, and Green Giant  brands. As of the annual assessment date, excess fair value above the carrying
value of these brand assets was as follows:

At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in
our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, future sales and profitability projections in our long-range plan for
this business declined. As a result of this triggering event, and in connection with the preparation of this report, we performed an interim
impairment assessment of the Green Giant brand intangible asset as of May 31, 2015, and determined that the fair value of the brand asset no
longer exceeded the carrying value of the asset. Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our updated long- range cash flow
projections for the Green Giant business, an updated royalty rate, a weighted-average cost of capital, and a tax rate. We recorded a $260 million
impairment charge in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 related to this asset.

We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

There were no realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale marketable securities. Gains and losses are determined by specific
identification. Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period, the security’s
maturity date, or both. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI
within stockholders’ equity.

As of May 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaling $40.1 million were pledged as collateral for derivative contracts. As of May 31, 2015,
$4.1 million of certain accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted line of credit.

The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $8,996.6 million and $8,608.1 million, respectively,
as of May 31, 2015. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps)
pursuant to our established policies.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to
manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy
products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to
the future price of commodities

66

Table of Contents

purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers,
exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market
conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible.

We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge
accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of
sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we nonetheless believe that these instruments are effective in achieving
our objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of
measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating
results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated
corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative without
experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included:

In Millions
Net loss on mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions
Net loss on commodity positions reclassified from
unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit
Net mark-to-market revaluation of certain grain inventories

As of May 31, 2015, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $384.0 million, of which $214.7 million related to agricultural inputs
and $169.3 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate
debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use
interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the
volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market
conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest
amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures — Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted
issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present
value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the
associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each
of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based
on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar
terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount
of hedge ineffectiveness was a $1.6 million gain in fiscal 2015 and less than $1 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013.

In advance of planned debt financing, we entered into € 600.0 million of forward starting swaps with an average fixed rate of 0.5 percent. All of
these forward starting swaps were cash settled for $6.5 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, coincident with the issuance of our
€ 500 million 8-year fixed-rate notes and €400 millio n 12-year fixed-rate notes.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into swaps to convert $500.0 million of 1.4 percent fixed-rate notes due October 20, 2017,
and $500.0 million of 2.2 percent fixed-rate notes due October 21, 2019, to floating rates.

In advance of planned debt financing, we entered into $250.0 million of treasury locks with an average fixed rate of 1.99 percent. All of these
treasury locks were cash settled for $17.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, coincident with the issuance of our $500.0 million 10-
year fixed-rate notes.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into swaps to convert $250.0 million of 0.875 percent fixed-rate notes due January 29, 2016,
to floating rates.

As of May 31, 2015, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI which will be reclassified to

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases,
intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to
the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi,
euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign
currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency
intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure; the gains or losses on these
derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not
hedge more than 18 months forward.

As of May 31, 2015, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $1,448.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less
than $1 million in each of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013.

We also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net
investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015,
we entered into a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in foreign operations denominated in euros by issuing € 900.0 million
of euro-denominated bonds. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into a net investment hedge for a portion of our net
investment in foreign operations denominated in euros by issuing €500.0 million of euro-denominated bo nds. As of May 31, 2015, we had
deferred net foreign currency transaction gains of $10.7 million in AOCI associated with hedging activity.

Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy and we remeasure the value of the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary based on the
exchange rate at which we expect to remit dividends in U.S. dollars. In February

70

Table of Contents

2014, the Venezuelan government established a new foreign exchange market mechanism (SICAD 2) and at that time indicated that it would be
the market through which U.S. dollars would be obtained for the remittance of dividends. On February 12, 2015, the Venezuelan government
replaced SICAD 2 with a new foreign exchange market mechanism (SIMADI). We expect to be able to access U.S. dollars through the
SIMADI market. SIMADI has significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms.
In fiscal 2015, we recorded an $8.0 million foreign exchange loss in unallocated corporate items resulting from the remeasurement of assets
and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the SIMADI rate of 199 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Our Venezuela operations represent less than
1 percent of our consolidated assets, liabilities, net sales, and segment operating profit. As of May 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million of non-U.S.
dollar cash balances in Venezuela.

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS

Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are
revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 31, 2015, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $124.2 million.
These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2016.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of
the major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request
full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-
related contingent features that were in a liability position on May 31, 2015, was $81.5 million. We have posted $25.0 million of collateral
under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on May 31, 2015, we would
have been required to post $56.5 million of collateral to counterparties.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK

During fiscal 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates (Wal-Mart) accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of
our net sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. Wal-Mart also
represented 7 percent of our net sales in the International segment and 9 percent of our net sales in the Convenience Stores and Foodservice
segment. As of May 31, 2015, Wal-Mart accounted for 29 percent of our U.S. Retail receivables, 6 percent of our International receivables, and
9 percent of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice receivables. The five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 54
percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales, the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for 24 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales,
and the five largest customers in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment accounted for 44 percent of its fiscal 2015 net sales.

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated
counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these
counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated
exchanges.

The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts,
is $16.7 million against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or
other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either
cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.

We offer certain suppliers access to a third party service that allows them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party service also
allows suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic
interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third party, or any financial institutions concerning
this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May 31, 2015,
$448.6 million of our total accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize this third party service.

Certain of our long-term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of these
covenants.

As of May 31, 2015, the $60.1 million pre-tax loss recorded in AOCI associated with our previously designated interest rate swaps will be
reclassified to net interest over the remaining lives of the hedged transactions. The amount expected to be reclassified from AOCI to net
interest in fiscal 2016 is a $10.6 million pre-tax loss.

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Our principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General
Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have six foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $8.2 million as
of May 31, 2015.

78

Table of Contents

We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl. Sodiaal
holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49 percent
euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited
portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year through a maximum term expiring December 2020. We adjust the value of
the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption
value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders
agreement. As of May 31, 2015, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $778.9 million.

In addition, a subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at
market-determined prices through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $271.3 million for fiscal 2015 and $311.2 million for fiscal 2014.

On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC
and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to  Yoplait  and related trademarks.
Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to  Liberté  and
related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of their fiscal year end.

During fiscal 2015, we paid $17.7 million of dividends to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC shareholder
agreements.

The holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a
floating preferred return rate, to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5
million). In fiscal 2015, the floating preferred return rate was equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points. The preferred
return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. On
June 1, 2015, subsequent to our year-end, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month
LIBOR plus 125 basis points.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned subsidiaries are included
in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings
attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the
authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative
instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.

During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,161.9 million. During fiscal
2014, we repurchased 35.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,774.4 million. During fiscal 2013, we
repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,014.9 million.

Table of Contents

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreement with an unrelated third party
financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we paid $300.0
million to the financial institution and received 5.5 million shares of common stock with a fair value of $270.0 million during the fourth quarter
of 2013. We received an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock upon completion of the ASR agreement during the first quarter of fiscal
2014. As of May 26, 2013, we recorded this transaction as an increase in treasury stock of $270.0 million, and recorded the remaining $30.0
million as a decrease to additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the ASR agreement in the first
quarter of fiscal 2014, we reclassified the $30.0 million to treasury stock from additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our stockholders. As of May 31, 2015, a
total of 27.1 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of
unrestricted stock under the 2011 Stock Compensation Plan (2011 Plan) and the 2011 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The
2011 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance based stock awards.
Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009 stock plans, under which no further
awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees
and directors.

Stock Options
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a
material impact on our financial statements. We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield,
and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option,
excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have
considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of
greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.

82

Table of Contents

Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option
exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and
therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented
in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to
as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow.

Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits
(amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if
any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We
calculated a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits.

Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant.
Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units
Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2011 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and
become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned based on our future achievement of three-year goals
for average organic net sales growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are subject to a four year vesting period and will
be settled with common stock one year following the completion of the three-year performance period. The sale or transfer of these awards is
restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled
to vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants
only receive payment if the awards vest.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for
salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly
amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary
contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2015 and 2014, and made a $200.0 million voluntary contribution in fiscal 2013. We do not
expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2016. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a
provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in
control. In fiscal 2012, we announced changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. All new salaried employees hired on or after June 1,
2013 are eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. Current salaried employees remain in the
existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States
salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts
for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made $24.0 million in voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2015 and
$24.0 million in voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2014.

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and
information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain
consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for
retirees age 65 and over and 6.5 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2015. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate
trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2025 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase
as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the
rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on
the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the
Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Estimates of
the future impacts of several of the Act’s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability.

Postemployment Benefit Plans
Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and
members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of
these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance
based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are
unfunded.

We use our fiscal year end as the measurement date for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their
lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. On October 27, 2014, the Society of Actuaries published RP-2014 Mortality Tables and
Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014, which both reflect improved longevity. We adopted the change to the mortality assumptions to
remeasure our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans obligations, which increased the total of these obligations by
$436.7 million.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $5,750.4 million as of May 31, 2015, and $5,093.1 million as of
May 25, 2014.

Discount Rates
Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension, other
postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuaries
to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond
yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is
applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate
of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term
inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year
does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to
participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined
benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the
portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans, the long-term
investment policy allocation is: 25 percent to equities in the United States; 15 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 35
percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). For other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term
investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities;
30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary
tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments

We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit
plans in fiscal 2016. Actual fiscal 2016 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake
discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected
future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2016 to 2025 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans
The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union employees.
This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net assets of $21.9 million as
of May 31, 2015, and $20.6 million as of May 25, 2014. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many of our foreign locations. Our total
recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $44.0 million in fiscal 2015, $44.8 million in fiscal 2014, and $46.0 million in
fiscal 2013.

We match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment options of
the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 7.5 million as of May 31,
2015, and 8.4 million as of May 25, 2014. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.

The Company stock fund and the ESOP held $655.6 million and $708.2 million of Company common stock as of May 31, 2015, and May 25,
2014.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current evidence does not
suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the
carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits.

94

Table of Contents

Of the total valuation allowance of $215.4 million, the majority relates to a deferred tax asset for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury
acquisition in the amount of $160.9 million and $47.8 million relates to various state and foreign loss carryforwards. As of May 31, 2015, we
believe it is more-likely-than-not that the remainder of our deferred tax assets are realizable.

We have $89.9 million of operating loss carryforwards. Of this amount, $78.7 million is foreign loss carryforwards and the carryforward
periods are as follows: $50.2 million do not expire; $3.8 million expire in fiscal 2016 and 2017; and $24.7 million expire in fiscal 2018 and
beyond. The remaining $11.2 million are state operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which expire after 2023.

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $1.9 billion from our foreign operations because our
subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is
not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes
are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. In fiscal 2015,
we approved a one-time repatriation of $606.1 million of foreign earnings to reduce the economic cost of funding current restructuring
initiatives and the acquisition of Annie’s completed in fiscal 2015. We recorded a discrete tax charge of $78.6 million in fiscal 2015 related to
this action. We have previously asserted that our foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and will only be repatriated in a tax-neutral
manner, and this one-time repatriation does not change this on-going assertion.

In fiscal 2010, we recorded a non-cash income tax charge and decrease to our deferred tax assets of $35.0 million related to a reduction of the
tax deductibility of retiree health cost to the extent of any Medicare Part D subsidy received beginning in fiscal 2013 under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. During fiscal 2013, we took
certain actions to restore part of the tax benefits associated with Medicare Part D subsidies and recorded a $33.7 million discrete decrease to
income tax expense and an increase to our deferred tax assets.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunction with the consent of the Class A investor, we restructured our GMC subsidiary through the
distribution of its manufacturing assets, stock, inventory, cash, and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary. GMC retained
the remaining intellectual property. Immediately following this restructuring, the Class A Interests were sold by the then current holder to
another unrelated third party investor. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $63.3 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities
related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC and certain distributed assets, with a corresponding discrete non-cash reduction to income
taxes in fiscal 2013.

We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may
elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust
these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually
require the use of cash.

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States
(federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year,
which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.

Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our
results of operations or financial position.

During fiscal 2014, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its field examination of our 2011 and 2012 tax years. The audit closure and related
adjustments did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. As of May 31, 2015, we have effectively settled
all issues with the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2012 and prior.

We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the
amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment
related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change.

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2015 and
2014. Approximately $84 million of this total in fiscal 2015 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax
rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities
below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state
tax benefits included therein.

As of May 31, 2015, we expect to pay approximately $1.4 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12
months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
outcomes. The remaining amount of our unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities.

We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2015, we recognized a
net benefit of $0.2 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $35.2 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 31, 2015.
For fiscal 2014, we recognized a net benefit of $4.6 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $42.0 million of accrued interest
and penalties as of May 25, 2014.

NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company’s leases are generally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations
was $193.5 million, $189.0 million, and $187.9 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Some operating leases require payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and
escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant.

These future lease commitments will be partially offset by estimated future sublease receipts of approximately $4 million. Depreciation on
capital leases is recorded as depreciation expense in our results of operations.

As of May 31, 2015, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $434.4 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated
subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $258.5 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly
CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which
totaled $400.5 million as of May 31, 2015.

NOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in the consumer foods industry. We have three operating segments by type of customer and geographic region as follows: U.S.
Retail, 59.6 percent of our fiscal 2015 consolidated net sales; International, 29.1 percent of our fiscal 2015 consolidated net sales; and
Convenience Stores and Foodservice, 11.3 percent of our fiscal 2015 consolidated net sales.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have changed how we assess operating segment performance to exclude the asset and liability
remeasurement impact from hyperinflationary economies. This impact is now included in unallocated corporate items. All periods presented
have been changed to conform to this presentation.

Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we realigned certain operating units within our U.S. Retail operating segment. We also
changed the name of our Yoplait operating unit to Yogurt and our Big G operating unit to Cereal. Frozen Foods transitioned into Meals and
Baking Products. Small Planet Foods transitioned into Snacks, Cereal, and Meals. The Yogurt operating unit was unchanged. We revised the
amounts previously reported in the net sales and net sales percentage change by operating unit within our U.S. Retail segment to conform to the
new operating unit structure. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating segments’ net sales,
operating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or EPS. In addition, results from the acquired Annie’s
business are included in the Meals and Snacks operating units. Our chief operating decision maker continues to assess performance and make
decisions about resources to be allocated to our segments at the U.S. Retail, International, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice operating
segment level.

Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains,
and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat
cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking
mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including meal kits, granola bars,
and cereal.

97

Table of Contents

Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. Our product categories include ready-to-
eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks,
refrigerated yogurt, grain and fruit snacks, and super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts. We also sell super-premium ice cream and frozen
desserts directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States
for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures.
Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located.

In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen
breakfasts, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and
nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience
stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substantially all of this segment’s operations are located in the United States.

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Unallocated
corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the
General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related
costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the
revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to
our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure
of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and
distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed
assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.

At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in
our U.S. Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. Therefore, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset. See Note 6 for additional information.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we approved a one-time repatriation of $606.1 million of foreign earnings and recorded a discrete
income tax charge of $78.6 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold certain grain elevators in our U.S. Retail segment and recorded a pre-tax gain of $65.5 million.

Glossary

Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets. The increase in depreciation expense caused by updating the salvage value
and shortening the useful life of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan, but only
if impairment is not present.

AOCI . Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Average total capital. Notes payable, long-term debt including current portion, redeemable interest, noncontrolling interests, and stockholders’
equity excluding AOCI, and certain after-tax earnings adjustments are used to calculate return on average total capital. The average is
calculated using the average of the beginning of fiscal year and end of fiscal year Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts for these line items.

Constant currency. Financial results translated to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for
the comparable prior-year period. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States
dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year,
rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current
year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the
corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.

Core working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.

Derivatives. Financial instruments such as futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts that we use to manage our risk arising from changes
in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and stock prices.

Euribor. European Interbank Offered Rate.

Fair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the
assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally
requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:

   Level  1:       Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level  2:       Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active

markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.

   Level  3:       Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

Fixed charge coverage ratio. The sum of earnings before income taxes and fixed charges (before tax), divided by the sum of the fixed charges
(before tax) and interest.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are required to use in recording and
reporting accounting information in our financial statements.

Goodwill. The difference between the purchase price of acquired companies plus the fair value of any noncontrolling and redeemable interests
and the related fair values of net assets acquired.

Gross margin. Net sales less cost of sales.

Hedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes
in the hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for

103

Table of Contents

certain hedging instruments and hedged items only if the hedging relationship is highly effective, and only prospectively from the date a
hedging relationship is formally documented.

Interest bearing instruments. Notes payable, long-term debt, including current portion, cash and cash equivalents, and certain interest bearing
investments classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.

LIBOR. London Interbank Offered Rate.

Mark-to-market. The act of determining a value for financial instruments, commodity contracts, and related assets or liabilities based on the
current market price for that item.

Net mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts that will be
allocated to segment operating profit when the exposure we are hedging affects earnings.

ITEM 9

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

ITEM 9A  Controls and Procedures

We, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of May 31, 2015, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the 1934 Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and
(2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that
allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act) during our fiscal
quarter ended May 31, 2015, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) .

Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) , management concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2015.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

GENERAL MILLS, INC.
2011 STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN

Exhibit 10.6

1.

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

The purpose of the General Mills, Inc. 2011 Stock Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) is to attract and retain able individuals by rewarding
employees of General Mills, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (defined as entities in which General Mills, Inc. has a significant equity or
other interest, collectively, the “Company”) and to align the interests of employees with those of the stockholders of the Company. The
Company shall include any successors to General Mills, Inc. or any future parent corporations or similar entities.

2.  EFFECTIVE DATE AND DURATION OF PLAN

This Plan shall become effective as of September 26, 2011, subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company at the Annual
Meeting on that date. Awards may be made under the Plan until September 30, 2021.

3.  ELIGIBLE PERSONS

Only persons who are employees of the Company shall be eligible to receive grants of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and/or Performance Awards (each defined below) and become “Participants” under the Plan.
The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) shall exercise the discretionary authority to
determine from time to time the employees of the Company who are eligible to participate in this Plan. Individuals who are not classified
by the Company as employees on its corporate books, records and systems are not eligible to receive Awards even if any individual is
later reclassified (by the Company, any court, any government agency or otherwise) as an employee of the Company as of any date in
particular.

4.  AWARD TYPES

(a)  Stock Option Awards.  The Committee may award Participants options (“Stock Options”) to purchase a fixed number of shares of

common stock ($.10 par value) of the Company (“Common Stock”). The grant of a Stock Option entitles the Participant to purchase
shares of Common Stock at an “Exercise Price” established by the Committee which, unless the Stock Option is granted through the
assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who become employees of the Company
as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition or other transaction involving the Company (in which case the assumption or
substitution shall be accomplished in a manner that permits the Award to be exempt from Code Section 409A), shall not be less
than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant, and may exceed the Fair Market Value on the grant
date, at the Committee’s discretion. “Fair Market Value” shall equal the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of the
Company’s Common Stock on the applicable date.

(b)  Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee may also award Participants Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right is

a right to receive, upon exercise of that right, an amount, which may be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination
thereof in the complete discretion of the Committee, equal to or less than the difference between the Fair Market Value of one share
of Common Stock as of the date of exercise and the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant, unless
the Stock Appreciation Right was granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted
to individuals who become employees of the Company as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or other transaction
involving the Company (in which case the assumption or substitution shall be accomplished in a manner that permits the Award to
be exempt from Code Section 409A).

(c)  Restricted Stock Awards.  The Committee may grant Participants, subject to certain restrictions, shares of Common Stock

(“Restricted Stock”) or the right to receive shares of Common Stock or cash (“Restricted Stock Units”).

(d)  Performance Awards.  Performance Awards may be made by the Committee granting a right to either the value of a number of

shares of Common Stock (“Performance Share Units”) or a monetary amount, which could be settled in such shares or in cash or a
combination thereof (“Performance Units”), determined based on the extent to which applicable performance goals are achieved.

Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards are sometimes referred to
as “Awards”. To the extent any Award is subject to section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 409A”),
the terms and administration of such Award shall comply therewith and IRS guidance thereunder. If any provision of the Plan would
otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the conflict. Further,
for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment of compensation under this
Plan shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the Section 409A deferral election rules and the
exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts.

5.  COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

(a)  Maximum Shares Available for Delivery.  Subject to Section 5(c), the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for
Awards to Participants under the Plan shall be 40,000,000. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights awarded shall reduce the
number of shares available for Awards by one share for every one share granted; provided that Stock Appreciation Rights that may
be settled only in cash shall not reduce the number of shares available for Awards. Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock
Units and Performance Awards settled in shares of Common Stock shall reduce the number of shares available for Awards by one
share for every one share delivered, up to 30 percent of the total number of shares available; beyond that, Restricted Stock,
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards settled in shares of Common Stock shall reduce the number of shares available for
Awards by six shares for every one share delivered. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards that may be settled only in
cash shall not reduce the number of shares available for Awards.

In addition, any Common Stock covered by a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan which is forfeited
prior to the end of the vesting period, or which expires or otherwise terminates without being exercised, shall be deemed not to be
granted for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan. In the
event a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is settled for cash, the number of shares deducted against the maximum number
of shares provided in Section 5(a) shall be restored and again be available for Awards. However, if (i) any Stock Option is exercised
through the delivery of Common Stock in satisfaction of the Exercise Price, and (ii) withholding tax requirements arising upon
exercise of any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right are satisfied through the withholding of Common Stock otherwise
deliverable in connection with such exercise, the full number of shares of Common Stock underlying any such Stock Option or
Stock Appreciation Right, or portion thereof being so issued shall count against the maximum number of shares available for grants
under the Plan.

Upon forfeiture or termination of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and
Performance Awards prior to vesting, the shares of Common Stock subject thereto shall again be available for Awards under the
Plan added back in the same multiple as they were awarded pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 5(a).

(b)

Individual Limits.  The number of shares of Common Stock subject to Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights or shares of
Common Stock available for Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards granted under the Plan to any single
Participant shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 2,000,000 shares and/or units per fiscal year. The maximum dollar value of
Performance Awards payable to any single Participant shall be $20,000,000 per fiscal year. These per-Participant limits shall be
construed and applied consistently with Code section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder.

(c)  Adjustments for Corporate Transactions.  If a corporate transaction has occurred affecting the Common Stock such that an

adjustment to outstanding Awards is required to preserve (or prevent enlargement of) the benefits or potential benefits intended at
the time of grant, then in such manner as the Committee deems equitable, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to (i) the number
and kind of shares which may be awarded under the Plan; (ii) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the
number of shares credited to an account; (iv) the individual limits imposed under the Plan; and if applicable; (v) the Exercise Price
of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights provided that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any Stock
Option or Stock Appreciation Right denominated in Common Stock shall always be a whole number. Any shares of Common Stock
underlying Awards granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals
who become employees of the Company as a result of a corporate transaction involving the Company shall not, unless required by
law or regulation, count against the reserve of available shares of Common Stock under the Plan. For purposes of this paragraph a
corporate transaction includes, but is not limited to, any dividend (other than a cash dividend that is not an extraordinary cash
dividend) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, securities of a subsidiary of the Company, other
securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of shares, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, acquisition, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the
Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other similar
corporate transaction. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, an adjustment to a Stock Option or Stock
Appreciation Right under this paragraph shall be made in a manner that will not result in the grant of a new Stock Option or Stock
Appreciation Right under Section 409A or cause the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right to fail to be exempt from
Section 409A.

(d)  Limits on Distribution.  Distribution of shares of Common Stock or other amounts under the Plan shall be subject to the following:

(i)

(ii)

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any shares of Common Stock
under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply
with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933), and the applicable
requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.

To the extent that the Plan provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
Restricted Stock, the issuance may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange.

(e)  Stock Deposit Requirements and other Restrictions.  The Committee, in its discretion, may require as a condition to the grant of
Awards, the deposit of Common Stock owned by the Participant receiving such grant, and the forfeiture of such grant, if such
deposit is not made or maintained during the required holding period. Such shares of deposited Common Stock may not be
otherwise sold or disposed of during the applicable holding period or restricted period. The Committee may also determine whether
any shares issued upon exercise of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or attainment of any performance goal, shall be
restricted in any manner.

6.

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS TERMS AND TYPE

(a)  General.  Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be Non-Qualified Stock Options governed by Section 83 of the Internal

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The term of any Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right granted under the
Plan shall be determined by the Committee, provided that said term shall not exceed 10 years and one month.

(b)  No Reload Rights.  Neither Stock Options nor Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan shall contain any provision

entitling the optionee or right-holder to the automatic grant of additional options or rights in connection with any exercise of the
original option or right.

(c)  No Repricing.  Subject to Section 5(c) and absent stockholder approval, the Exercise Price of an outstanding Stock Option may not
be decreased after the grant date; the value of Common Stock used to determine the amount paid upon the exercise of a Stock
Appreciation Right (i.e., the equivalent of an option’s exercise price) may not be decreased after the date of grant; no outstanding
Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be surrendered to the Company as consideration or otherwise for the grant of a
new Award with a lower exercise price; and no other modifications to any outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights
may be made that would be treated as a “repricing” under the then applicable rules or listing requirements adopted by the New York
Stock Exchange.

7.  GRANT, EXERCISE AND VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

(a)  Grant.  Subject to the limits otherwise imposed by the terms of this Plan, the Committee has discretionary authority to determine

the size of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right Award, which may be tied to meeting performance-based requirements.

(b)  Exercise.  Except as provided in Sections 11 and 12 (Change of Control and Termination of Employment), each Stock Option or
Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Option grant or Stock
Appreciation Right and during the periods as may be established by the Committee. A Participant exercising a Stock Option or
Stock Appreciation Right shall give notice to the Company of such exercise and of the number of shares elected to be purchased
prior to 4:30 P.M. CST/CDT on the day of exercise.

(c)  Vesting.  Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable unless vested. Subject to Sections 11 and 12 Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be fully vested only after at least four years of the Participant’s continued service with
the Company following the date of the grant.

(d)  Payment of Exercise Price.  The Exercise Price for Stock Options shall be paid to the Company at the time of such exercise,

subject to any applicable rule adopted by the Committee:

(i)

in cash (including check, draft, money order or wire transfer made payable to the order of the Company);

(ii)

through the tender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant (by either actual delivery or attestation);

(iii)

by a combination of (i) and (ii) above; or

(iv)

by authorizing a third party broker to sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the
Stock Option and remit to the Company such sales proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding
resulting from the exercise.

For determining the amount of the payment, Common Stock delivered pursuant to (ii) or (iii) shall have a value equal to the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of exercise.

8.  RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be awarded on either a discretionary or performance-based method.

(a)  Discretionary.  With respect to discretionary Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, the Committee shall:

(i)

Select Participants to whom Awards will be made;

(ii)

Subject to the otherwise applicable Plan limits, determine the number of shares of Restricted Stock or the number of
Restricted Stock Units to be awarded to a Participant;

(iii)  Determine the length of the restricted period, which, other than as expressly allowed under the Plan, shall be no less than

four years;

(iv)  Determine the purchase price, if any, to be paid by the Participant for Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units;

(v)

Determine whether Restricted Stock Unit Awards will be settled in shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination
thereof; and

(vi)  Determine any restrictions other than those set forth in this Section.

(b)  Performance-Based.  With respect to Awards of performance-based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, the intent is to

grant such Awards so as to satisfy the requirements for “qualified performance-based compensation” under Code Section 162(m).
Performance-based Awards are subject to the following:

(i)

(ii)

The Committee has exclusive authority to determine which Participants may be awarded performance-based Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units and whether any Restricted Stock Unit Awards will be settled in shares of Common Stock,
cash, or a combination thereof.

In order for any Participant to be awarded Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units for a Performance Period (defined
below), the net earnings from continuing operations excluding items identified and disclosed by the Company as non-
recurring or special costs and after taxes (“Net Earnings”) of the Company for such Performance Period must be greater than
zero.

(iii)  At the end of the Performance Period, if the Committee determines that the requirement of Section 8(b)(ii) has been met,
each Participant eligible for a performance-based Award shall be deemed to have earned an Award equal in value to the
Maximum Amount, or such lesser amount as the Committee shall determine in its discretion to be appropriate. The
Committee may base this determination on performance-based criteria and in no case shall this have the effect of increasing
an Award payable to any other Participant. For purposes of computing the value of Awards, each Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Unit shall be deemed to have a value equivalent to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on
the date the Award is granted.

(iv)  The total value and/or number of shares or units of the performance-based Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award

granted to any Participant for any one Performance Period shall not exceed the lesser of 0.5 percent of the Company’s Net
Earnings for that Performance Period (such amount is the “Maximum Amount”), or the number of shares of Common Stock
available under Section 5(b) hereof.

(v)

(vi)

The Committee shall determine the length of the restricted period which, other than as expressly allowed under the Plan,
shall be no less than four years.

“Performance Period” means a fiscal year of the Company, or such other period as the Committee may from time to time
establish, which in no case shall be less than one year.

Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section, each Participant who receives Restricted Stock shall have certain rights as a
stockholder with respect to such shares, as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Each Participant who is awarded Restricted
Stock Units that are settled in shares of Common Stock shall be eligible to receive, at the expiration of the applicable restricted period (or
such later time as provided herein),

one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit awarded, and the Company shall issue to each such Participant that number of
shares of Common Stock. Each Participant who is awarded Restricted Stock Units that are settled in cash shall receive an amount equal to
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the applicable restricted period ends, multiplied by the number of Units
awarded. Participants who receive Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights as stockholders with respect to such Restricted Stock Units
until such time as share certificates for Common Stock are issued to the Participants (if applicable); provided, however, that as of the first
day of each quarter, during the applicable restricted period for all Restricted Stock Units awarded hereunder, the Company may credit to
each such Participant an amount equal to the sum of all dividends and other distributions paid by the Company during the prior quarter on
that equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section or the Plan to the contrary, any
dividends or other distributions paid on Restricted Stock, or any dividend equivalents or other distributions credited in respect to
Restricted Stock Units, shall be distributed (in either cash or shares of Common Stock, with or without interest or other earnings, as
provided in the Award Agreement at the discretion of the Committee) to the Participant only if, when, and to the extent the restrictions
imposed on the attendant Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units lapse, and in an amount equal to the sum of all quarterly dividends
and other distributions paid by the Company during the applicable restricted period on the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock
which become unrestricted. Such dividends, dividend equivalents, or other distributions shall be payable at the same time as the attendant
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to which they relate, as provided under the applicable terms of the Plan and relevant Award
Agreements. Dividends, dividend equivalents, and other distributions that are not so vested shall be forfeited.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8, the Committee may in its discretion award up to five percent of the shares
authorized under this Plan on an unrestricted basis, subject to the limits of Section 5.

The Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to defer receipt of any Common Stock or cash issuable upon the lapse of any
restriction of Restricted Stock Units, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish. In particular, the Committee shall establish
rules relating to such deferrals intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A, including without limitation, the time
when a deferral election can be made, the period of the deferral, and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount.

9.

PERFORMANCE AWARDS

(a)  Grant.  The Committee may grant Performance Awards which may be denominated in shares of Common Stock (“Performance

Share Units”) or notionally represented by a monetary value, and which may be settled in shares of Common Stock, paid in cash, or
a combination thereof (“Performance Units”).

(b)  Performance Goal.  In order for any Participant to be granted a Performance Award for a Performance Period (defined below), the
net earnings from continuing operations excluding items identified and disclosed by the Company as non-recurring or special costs
and after taxes (“Net Earnings”) of the Company for such Performance Period must be greater than zero.

(c)  Grant Size.  At the end of the Performance Period, if the Committee determines that the requirement of Section 9(b) has been met,

each Participant eligible for a Performance Award shall be deemed to be granted an Award equal in value to the Maximum Amount,
or such lesser amount as the Committee determines in its discretion to be appropriate. The Committee may base this determination
on additional performance-based criteria and in no case shall this have the effect of increasing an Award payable to any other
Participant. For purposes of computing the grant value of Awards, each Performance Award denominated in shares of Common
Stock (whether or not share settled) shall be deemed to have a value equivalent to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common
Stock on the date the Award is granted.

(d)  Additional Performance Conditions and Vesting.  Awards granted under this Section 9 shall be subject to such other terms and
conditions as the Committee, in its discretion, imposes in the relevant Award Agreement. These conditions may include service
and/or performance requirements and goals over

periods of one or more years that could result in the future forfeiture of all or part of the Performance Award granted hereunder in
the event of the Participant’s termination of employment with the Company prior to the expiration of any service conditions, and/or
said performance criteria or other conditions are not met in whole or in part within the designated period of time. This designated
period of time shall be referred to as the “Additional Performance Period”. Except as provided in Sections 11(b), (c) and 12(c),
Performance Awards shall not be paid other than on the date specified in the relevant Award Agreement after the end of the
Additional Performance Period.

(e)  Maximum Amount.  The total value of a Performance Award granted to any Participant for any one Performance Period shall not
exceed the lesser of 0.5 percent of the Company’s Net Earnings for that Performance Period (such amount is the “Maximum
Amount”), or the dollar value limit on Performance Awards under Section 5(b).

(f)  Performance Period.  “Performance Period” means the period as the Committee may from time to time establish, which is no case

shall be less than one year.

(g)  Dividend Equivalents and Voting.  At the discretion of the Committee, Performance Share Units may be credited with amounts

equal to the sum of all dividends and other distributions paid by the Company during the prior quarter on that equivalent number of
shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, any dividend equivalents or other distributions so credited shall
be distributed (in either cash or shares of Common Stock, with or without interest or other earnings, as provided in the Award
Agreement at the discretion of the Committee) to the Participant only if, when, and to the extent the conditions imposed on the
attendant Performance Share Units are satisfied, and in an amount equal to the sum of all quarterly dividends and other distributions
paid by the Company during the relevant Performance Period and/or Additional Performance Period on the equivalent number of
shares of Common Stock which become payable. Such dividend equivalents or other distributions shall be payable at the same time
as the attendant Performance Share Units to which they relate, as provided under the applicable terms of the Plan and Award
Agreement. Dividend equivalents and other distributions that are not so vested shall be forfeited. Dividend equivalents shall not be
credited in respect to Performance Units. Participants who receive either Performance Share Units or Performance Units shall have
no rights as stockholders and in particular shall have no voting rights.

The Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to defer receipt of any Common Stock or cash issuable under a Performance
Award subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish. In particular, the Committee shall establish rules relating to such deferrals
intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A, including without limitation, the time when a deferral election can be
made, the period of the deferral, and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount.

10.  TAXES

The Company has the right to withhold amounts from Awards to satisfy required tax obligations as it deems appropriate. Whenever the
Company issues Common Stock under the Plan, unless it decides to satisfy the withholding obligations through additional withholding on
salary or other wages, it may require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any Federal, state, local or
foreign tax withholding requirements prior to the delivery of such Common Stock, or the Company may in its discretion withhold from
the shares to be delivered shares sufficient to satisfy all or a portion of such tax withholding requirements.

11.  CHANGE OF CONTROL

(a)  Each of the following (i) through (iv) constitutes a “Change of Control”:

(i)

The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act), (a
“Person”) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of voting securities
of the Company where such acquisition causes such Person to own 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting

securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the “Outstanding Voting Securities”);
provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (i), the following acquisitions shall not be deemed to result in a
Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the Company, (C) any acquisition
by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any corporation controlled by
the Company or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction that complies with clauses (A), (B) and
(C) of subsection (iii) below; and provided, further, that if any Person’s beneficial ownership of the Outstanding Voting
Securities reaches or exceeds 20% as a result of a transaction described in clause (A) or (B) above, and such Person
subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of additional voting securities of the Company, such subsequent acquisition shall
be treated as an acquisition that causes such Person to own 20% or more of the Outstanding Voting Securities; or

(ii)

Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board of Directors (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date
hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member
of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; or

(iii)  Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar transaction involving the

Company or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the
acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a “Business Combination”);
excluding however, such a Business Combination pursuant to which (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities
who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as
the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation
which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets either directly or
through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such
Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Securities, (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from
such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting
from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively, the then
outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting
power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to
the Business Combination and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting
from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial
agreement, or of the action of the Board, providing for such Business Combination; or

(iv)  Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

(b)

If, within two years after a Change of Control a Participant experiences an involuntary separation from service initiated by the
Company for reasons other than “cause” (for this purpose cause shall have the same meaning as that term has in Section 4.2(b)(ii)
of Plan B of the General Mills Separation Pay and Benefits Program for Officers), or a separation from service for “good reason”
actually entitling the employee to certain separation benefits under Section 4.2(a)(ii) of Plan B of the General Mills Separation Pay
and Benefits Program for Officers, the following applies:

(i)

All of his or her then outstanding and unvested Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall fully vest immediately
and remain exercisable for the one-year period beginning on the date of his or her separation from service or, if earlier, the
end of the term of the Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right.

(ii)  All shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest and be settled immediately (subject to a proper

deferral election made with respect to the Award).

(iii)  All Performance Awards shall fully vest immediately and shall be considered to be earned in full “at target” as if the

applicable performance goals established for the Additional Performance Period have been achieved, and paid immediately
(subject to a proper deferral election made with respect to the Award).

(iv)

If Awards are replaced pursuant to subsection (d) below, the protections and rights granted under this subsection (b) shall
transfer and apply to such replacement awards.

Notwithstanding the above, any Restricted Stock Units or Performance Awards subject to Section 409A (not subject to a proper
deferral election) shall be settled on the Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) or in the case of
a Participant who is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A) on the first day of the seventh month following
the month of the Participant’s separation from service.

(c)

If, in the event of a Change of Control, and to the extent outstanding Awards are not assumed by a successor corporation (or
affiliate thereto) or other successor entity or person, or replaced with an award or grant that solely in the discretionary judgment of
the Committee, which shall be reasonable, preserves the existing value of outstanding Awards at the time of the Change of Control,
then the following shall occur:

(i)

Subject to the other provisions of this subsection (c), All Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall vest and
become exercisable immediately upon the Change of Control event.

(ii)

The restrictions on all shares of Restricted Stock shall lapse and Restricted Stock Units shall vest immediately.

(iii)  All Performance Awards shall fully vest immediately and shall be considered to be earned in full “at target” as if the

applicable performance goals established for the Additional Performance Period have been achieved.

(iv)  To the extent Code Section 409A applies, if the Change of Control constitutes a “change in control” event as described in
IRS regulations or other guidance under Code section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Participants’ Restricted Stock Units and
Performance Awards shall be settled and paid upon the Change of Control in accordance with the requirements of Code
Section 409A.

(v)

If the Change of Control does not constitute a “change in control” event as described in IRS regulations or other guidance
under Code section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v), Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards that are not Section 409A Restricted
Stock Units and/or not otherwise subject to Section 409A, and on which a deferral election was not made, shall be settled
and paid upon the Change of Control. However, the Section 409A Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards otherwise
subject to Section 409A, or such Awards for which a proper deferral election was made, shall be settled in cash equal to
either the Award’s Fair Market Value at the time of the Change of Control, or its monetary value provided for above in (iii),
as applicable, plus interest at a rate of Prime plus 1% from the Change of Control to the date of payment, which shall be the
time the original restriction period would have closed, the Performance Award would have been originally payable, or the
date elected pursuant to the proper deferral election, as applicable.

In the discretion of the Committee and notwithstanding subsection (c)(i) above or any other Plan provision, outstanding Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (both exercisable and unexercisable) may be cancelled at the time of the Change of Control
in exchange for cash, property, or a combination thereof that is determined by the Committee to be at least equal to the excess (if
any) of the value of the consideration that would be received in such Change of Control by the holders of Common Stock, over the
exercise price for such Awards. For purposes of clarification, by operation of this provision Stock Options and Stock Appreciation
Rights that would not yield a gain at the time of the Change of Control under the aforementioned equation are subject to
cancellation without consideration. Furthermore, the Committee is under no obligation to treat Awards and/or Participants
uniformly and has the discretionary authority to treat Awards and Participants disparately.

(d)

If in the event of a Change of Control and to the extent outstanding Awards are assumed by any successor corporation, affiliate
thereof, person or other entity, or are replaced with awards that, solely in the discretionary judgment of the Committee preserve the
existing value of outstanding Awards at the time of the Change of Control and provide for vesting payout terms, and performance
goals, as applicable, that are at least as favorable to Participants as vesting, payout terms and Performance Goals applicable to
Awards, then all such Awards or such substitutes thereof shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms,
subject to Subsection 11(b) hereof.

(e)  With respect to any outstanding Awards as of the date of any Change of Control which require the deposit of owned Common Stock

as a condition to obtaining rights, the deposit requirement shall be terminated as of the date of the Change of Control.

12.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

(a)  Resignation or Termination for Cause.  If the Participant’s employment by the Company is terminated by either

(i)

(ii)

the voluntary resignation of the Participant, or

a Company discharge due to Participant’s illegal activities, poor work performance, misconduct or violation of the
Company’s Code of Conduct, policies or practices,

then the Participant’s Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate three months after such termination (but in no
event beyond the original full term of the Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights) and no Stock Options or Stock Appreciation
Rights shall become exercisable after such termination, and all shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units which are subject
to restriction on the date of termination, and all outstanding Performance Awards, shall be cancelled and forfeited.

(b)  Other Termination.  If the Participant’s employment by the Company terminates involuntarily at the initiation of the Company for
any reason other than specified in Sections 11, 12 (a), (d) or (e), and upon the execution (without revoking) of an effective general
legal release and such other documents as are satisfactory to the Company, the following rules shall apply:

(i)

In the event that, at the time of such involuntary termination, the sum of the Participant’s age and years of service with the
Company equals or exceeds 70, (A) the Participant’s outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall
continue to become exercisable according to the schedule established at the time of grant unless otherwise provided in the
applicable Award Agreement; (B) the restriction on all shares of Restricted Stock shall lapse and Restricted Stock Units shall
vest and be paid (or deferred, as appropriate) immediately; and (C) any Performance Awards remaining outstanding during
the Additional Performance Period shall fully vest and be payable according to the original terms of the Award with a value,
if any, that otherwise would be earned under the applicable performance goals originally established under the Award
Agreement based on actual performance (subject to a proper deferral election). Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
shall remain exercisable for the remaining full term of such Awards.

(ii)

In the event that, at the time of such involuntary termination, the sum of the Participant’s age and years of service with the
Company is less than 70, (A) the Participant’s outstanding unexercisable Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, and
unvested Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, shall become exercisable or vest and paid or deferred immediately, as
the case may be, as of the date of termination, in a pro-rata amount based on the full months of employment completed
during the full vesting period from the date of grant to the date of termination with such newly-vested Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights, and Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights exercisable on the date of termination,
remaining exercisable for the lesser of one year from the date of termination and the original full term of the Stock Option
and/or Stock Appreciation Right; and (B) the Participant’s Performance Awards remaining outstanding during the
Additional Performance Period shall be payable according to the original terms of the Award with a value, if any, that
otherwise would be earned under the applicable performance goals originally established under the Award Agreement based
on actual performance, and shall vest at the end of the relevant Additional Performance Period in a pro-rata amount based on
the full months of employment completed during the relevant Additional Performance Period originally established in the
Award Agreement through the date of termination. All other Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, shares of Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards shall be forfeited as of the date of termination. Provided, however,
that if the Participant is a Company Senior Vice President or above, the Participant’s outstanding Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights which, as of the date of termination are not yet exercisable, shall become exercisable effective as of the
date of such termination and, with all outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights already exercisable on the
date of termination, shall remain exercisable for the lesser of one year following the date of termination and the original full
term of the Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right; all shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall fully
vest as of the date of termination and be paid or deferred immediately; and any outstanding Performance Awards shall fully
vest and be payable according to the original terms of the Award with a value, if any, that otherwise would be earned under
the applicable performance goals originally established in the Award Agreement (subject to a proper deferral election).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Section 409A Restricted Stock Units that vest under this Section 12(b) shall be paid on the
Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Code section 409A), or in the case of a Participant who is a specified
employee (within the meaning of Code section 409A) shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following the month of
separation from service.

An Award that otherwise would be settled under the terms of this section shall be forfeited if the general release of claims provided
by the Company as a condition of payment is not executed (and not revoked) within the deadlines established by the Company.
Upon execution of (and failure to revoked) the release (i.e., upon its irrevocability), the Award shall be settled within 90 days
following the Participant’s separation from service; provided, however, that if two calendar years could be spanned from the start to
the end of said 90-day period, settlement shall always be in the second calendar year regardless of when the release actually became
irrevocable.

(c)  Death.  If a Participant dies while employed by the Company, any Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right previously granted
under this Plan shall fully vest and become exercisable upon death and may be exercised by the person designated as such
Participant’s beneficiary or beneficiaries or, in the absence of such designation, by the Participant’s estate. Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights shall remain exercisable for the remaining full term of such Awards. A Participant who dies while employed by
the Company during any applicable restricted period shall fully vest in such shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
effective as of the date of death, and such shares or cash shall be paid as of the first day of the month following death to the
designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. If a Participant dies while employed by the Company during an Additional Performance
Period, all Performance Awards shall fully vest and shall be considered to be earned in full “at target” as if the applicable
performance goals have been achieved, and paid on the first day of the month following death to the designated beneficiary or
beneficiaries.

(d)  Retirement.  The Committee shall determine, at the time of grant, the treatment of Awards upon the retirement of the Participant.
Unless other terms are specified in the original Award Agreement, if the termination of employment is due to a Participant’s
retirement on or after age 55 and completion of five years of eligibility service under the General Mills Pension Plan, the Participant
may, effective as of the date of employment termination as a retiree, exercise a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right pursuant
to the original terms and conditions of such Awards; shall fully vest in, and be paid or have deferred, all shares of Restricted Stock
or shares or cash attributable to Restricted Stock Units; and all Performance Awards shall fully vest and be payable according to the
original terms of the Award with a value, if any, that otherwise would be earned under the applicable performance goals originally
established in the Award Agreement based on actual performance (subject to a proper deferral election made with respect to the
Award). However, the Restricted Stock Units without a proper deferral election that vest under this Section 12(d) shall be payable
on the Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A) or in the case of a Participant who is a specified
employee (within the meaning of Section 409A) shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following the month of
separation from service.

A Restricted Stock Unit that could vest upon retirement under this Section 12(d) at any time within the Award’s restricted period
shall be referred to as a “Section 409A Restricted Stock Unit”.

Notwithstanding the above, the terms of this Section 12(d) shall not apply to a Participant who, prior to a Change of Control, is
terminated for cause as described in Section 12(a)(ii); said Participant shall be treated as provided in Section 12(a).

(e)  Spin-offs and Other Divestitures.  If the termination of employment is due to the divestiture, cessation, transfer, or spin-off of a

line of business or other activity of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the conversion, vesting, or
other treatment of all outstanding Awards under the Plan. Such treatment shall be consistent with Section 409A, and in particular
will take into account whether a separation from service has occurred within the meaning of Section 409A.

13.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

(a)  Administration.  The authority to control and manage the operations and administration of the Plan shall be vested in the

Committee in accordance with this Section.

(b)  Selection of Committee. The Committee shall be selected by the Board, and shall consist of two or more outside, disinterested

members of the Board who, in the judgment of the Board, are qualified to administer the Plan as contemplated by Rule 16b-3 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (or any successor rule), Code section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder (or any
successors thereto), and any rules and regulations of a stock exchange on which Common Stock is traded.

(c)  Powers of Committee.  The authority to manage and control the operations and administration of the Plan shall be vested in the

Committee, subject to the following:

(i)

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to select from among the eligible
Company employees those persons who shall receive Awards, to determine the time or times of receipt, to determine the
types of Awards and the number of shares or amounts covered by the Awards, to establish the terms, conditions,
performance criteria, performance period, restrictions, and other provisions of such Awards, to specify that the Participant’s
rights, payments, and benefits with respect to Awards shall be subject to adjustment, reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or
recoupment under certain circumstances, and (subject to the restrictions imposed by Section 14) to cancel or suspend
Awards. In making such determinations, the Committee may take into account the nature of services rendered by the
individual, the individual’s present and potential contribution to the Company’s success and such other factors as the
Committee deems relevant. Such terms and conditions may be evidenced by an agreement (“Award Agreement”), which
need not require execution by the Participant, in which case acceptance of the Award shall constitute agreement by the
Participant with all its terms, conditions, limitations and forfeiture provisions.

(ii)

The Committee will have the authority and discretion to establish terms and conditions of Awards as the Committee
determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions outside of the
United States.

(iii)  The Committee will have the authority and discretion to interpret the Plan, Award Agreements, and any other documents

ancillary thereto, to establish, modify, and rescind any rules relating to the Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any
Award Agreements made pursuant to the Plan, to correct any technical defect(s) or omission(s) in connection with the Plan,
Award Agreement, and any other documents ancillary thereto, reconcile any technical inconsistencies in connection with the
Plan, Award Agreement, and any other documents ancillary thereto, and to make all other determinations that may be
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

(iv)  Any interpretation of the Plan, Award Agreements, and any other documents ancillary thereto, by the Committee and any

decision made by it under the Plan, Award Agreements, and any other documents ancillary thereto, is final and binding.
There is no obligation for uniformity or consistency of treatment of Participants or Awards under the Plan.

(v)

The Committee will have exclusive authority and discretion to decide how outstanding Awards will be treated, and is
empowered to make all elections among possible options, consistent with Sections 11(c) and (d).

(d)  Delegation by Committee.  Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the

Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all
or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it. Any such allocation or delegation may be
revoked by the Committee at any time.

(e)  Designation of Beneficiary.  Each Participant to whom an Award has been made under the Plan may designate a beneficiary or
beneficiaries to exercise any Award or to receive any payment which under the terms of the Plan and the relevant Award
Agreement may become exercisable or payable on or after the Participant’s death. At any time, and from time to time, any such
designation may be changed or cancelled by the Participant without the consent of any such beneficiary. Any such designation,
change or cancellation must be on a form provided for that purpose by the Committee and shall not be effective until received by
the Committee. Such form may establish other rules as the Committee deems appropriate. If no beneficiary has been designated by
a deceased Participant, or if all the designated beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, the beneficiary shall be the
Participant’s estate. If the Participant designates more than one beneficiary, any payments under the Plan to such beneficiaries shall
be made in equal shares unless the Participant has expressly designated otherwise, in which case the payments shall be made in the
shares designated by the Participant.

14.  AMENDMENTS OF THE PLAN

The Committee may from time to time prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating to the Plan. Subject to the approval of the Board of
Directors, where required, the Committee may at any time terminate, amend, or suspend the operation of the Plan, provided that no action
shall be taken by the Board of Directors or the Committee without the approval of the stockholders which would:

(a)

except as provided in Section 5(c), materially increase the number of shares which may be issued under the Plan;

(b)  permit granting of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights at less than Fair Market Value;

(c)

except as provided in Section 5(c), permit the repricing (as provided in Section 6(c)) of outstanding Stock Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights; or

(d)

amend the individual limits on awards set forth in Section 5(b) which may be granted to any single Participant.

No termination, modification, suspension, or amendment of the Plan shall alter or impair the rights of any Participant pursuant to an
outstanding Award, in any material respect, without the consent of the Participant. There is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of
Participants or Awards under the Plan.

15.  FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan and/or
to comply with provisions of the laws in countries outside the United Sates in which the Company operates or has employees, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to (i) determine which Eligible Persons (if any) employed by the
Company outside the United States should participate in the Plan, (ii) modify the terms and conditions of any Awards made to such
Eligible Persons, and (iii) establish sub-plans, modified Option exercise procedures and other Award terms, conditions and procedures to
the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable to comply with provisions of the laws in such countries outside the United States in
order to assure the lawfulness, validity and effectiveness of Awards granted under the Plan.

16.  TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS

Except as otherwise provided by rules of the Committee, no Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Right shall be transferable by a
Participant otherwise than (i) by the Participant’s last will and testament or (ii) by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, and
such Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercised during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or his or her
guardian or legal representative. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 8 or 9, no shares of Restricted Stock, no Restricted Stock Units
and no Performance Awards shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of during the restricted period.

17.  NON-ALIENATION OF RIGHTS AND BENEFITS

Subject to Sections 16 and 20, and the rights of the Company and the Committee established under the Plan’s terms, no right or benefit
under the Plan shall be subject to alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, or encumbrance and any attempt to do so shall be void. No right or
benefit under the Plan be subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such rights or benefits.

18.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY

Nothing in the Plan shall be construed

(a)

to give any employee of the Company any right to be granted any Award other than at the sole discretion of the Committee, or to
give any such employee the ability to designate, directly or indirectly, the calendar year or timing of payments under the Plan
(absent a proper deferral election);

(b)

to give any Participant any rights whatsoever with respect to shares of Common Stock except as specifically provided in the Plan;

(c)

(d)

to limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate, change or modify, with or without cause, the
employment of any Participant at any time; or

to be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company or any Subsidiary will employ any
Participant in any particular position at any particular rate of compensation or for any particular period of time.

Payments and other benefits received by a Participant under an Award shall not be deemed part of a Participant’s regular, recurring
compensation for purposes of any termination, indemnity or severance pay laws and shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the
determination of benefits under any other employee benefit plan, contract or similar arrangement provided by the Company or any
Subsidiary, unless expressly so provided by such other plan, contract or arrangement.

19.  NO LOANS

The Company shall not lend money to any Participant to finance a transaction under this Plan.

20.  CLAWBACK POLICY

Awards are specifically made subject to the Company’s Executive Compensation Clawback Policy, as it is amended from time to time, to
the full extent said Policy is applicable.

21.  NOTICES

All notices to the Company regarding the Plan shall be in writing, effective as of actual receipt by the Company, and shall be sent to:

Attention: Corporate Compensation
General Mills, Inc.
Number One General Mills Boulevard
Minneapolis, MN 55426

22.  RECOGNITION AWARDS

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee is given the discretionary authority to award up to a total
of 20,000 unrestricted shares of Common Stock during each calendar year to selected employees as a bonus or reward (“Recognition
Awards”). Under this paragraph no employee shall receive over 200 shares of Common Stock as Recognition Awards over the duration
of the Plan’s term.
